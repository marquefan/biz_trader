Hey BizI&#039;ve been talking with my mom, and I got her to sell an expensive watch we have. We&#039;ll receive around 3k.I told her to buy a mining right. Think this is a good idea?
&gt;&gt;2375680&gt;expensive&gt;3k
&gt;&gt;2375680Well... anythings gotta be better than a useless watch.
&gt;&gt;2375680No op you are retarded. Mining isnt profitable. Not this late in the game unless you have free electricity
&gt;&gt;2375815What is genesis mining?
&gt;&gt;2375815&gt;Not profitableAre you one of those retards who think mining is just bitcoin?It&#039;s incredibly profitable assuming you don&#039;t live in somewhere like germany. Even with the highest power costs in america you&#039;d be turning a huge profit.https://whattomine.com/
&gt;&gt;2375815We do have free electricity though.&gt;&gt;2375742Well, 3k on a watch is expensive to me&gt;&gt;2375813&gt;&gt;2375828My 1060GTX can generate 4 dollars a day just by working. If I can get 3 T9 miners. that&#039;s around 39 Dollars a day for doing nothing.How is this not profitable?
&gt;&gt;2375828&gt;What is genesis mining?A literal ponzi. How can anyone believe this &quot;cloud mining&quot; bullshit? lmao&gt;&gt;2375860&gt;How is this not profitable?Depends on how much you pay in electricity.Personally I would just buy btc, eth and xmr and don&#039;t touch it for a year.
&gt;&gt;2375883&gt;Depends on how much you pay in electricity.0. My landlord payed some people to steal it, so I don&#039;t have to pay anything.Everything I get from mining, would be clean past the initial investment.&gt;Personally I would just buy btcI don&#039;t have money, and I haven&#039;t been able to convince her invest in bitcoin, so this is the best I&#039;ve got. Also, she told me she would gift me one of the T9&#039;s for myself, so I can start saving up to invest in bitcoin this way too.
&gt;&gt;2375980&gt;0.Well in that case you could make some profits.
&gt;&gt;2376009My mother still has a hard time believing you can get paid by just having your computer on all day long. If I can get her to do it, it&#039;s going to be great.
&gt;&gt;2375883&gt;&gt;2375980&gt;&gt;2376009the electricity cost thing is a meme anyways. So long as you have somewhat reasonable rates you can make a killing. I pay like 20 bucks a month (in addition to standard use) and make about 500.
&gt;&gt;2376091Shit, that&#039;s awesome, Anon!.Do you recommend getting a miner, or should I go with GPU&#039;s? I plan on using something like NiceHash to sell my hashing power instead of mining coins myself.
&gt;&gt;2376091Yeah I&#039;m super interested. Can you pass along some of the best mining resources. This thread is helping me realize that you don&#039;t just have to mine BTC
&gt;&gt;2376118I use GPUs, but I didn&#039;t put any money in up front per se. I just use computers I already had anyways. Who knows how long mining will be profitable? AMD is releasing Vega soon and that could obselete all the cards currently on the market. If you&#039;re going to buy in now you may just barely break even before vega comes out. And if vega is a good miner, you&#039;re gonna be fucked.
&gt;&gt;2375680no nigga just get a fucking job/ drop shit or some stupid shit on the side
&gt;&gt;2376217I&#039;ll do some research, thank you.
&gt;&gt;2376263&gt;get a fucking jobMy mom and I have been trying to get a job for the last 6 months. I live in a rural part of Spain, so enough said.
&gt;&gt;2376217So just wait for Vega, eh?
&gt;&gt;2375815im turning $1.75 in electricity into ~$35-40 worth of coin a day. Don&#039;t know what this guy is talking about
My condolences.
I hope Jared dies a horrible death for this bullshit.Fucking scam through and through. I feel so bad for the people who bought this total garbage.
We hodled like champs. Never listen to biz. We are going to be okay lads.
&gt;&gt;2376164LMAO yeah keep &quot;hodling&quot; as your balance utterly plummets. This garbagecoin is going below 1000 sats, screencap this.And if it doesn&#039;t, my buddies and I will ensure it does just to fuck with you idiots and make a profit off your losses.
&gt;&gt;2376186Even 900 sats would be over 1000% gains for me.Holding until 300 or 30000 desu.
&gt;&gt;2376223Gains on your principle, but you have lost big the last 2 days.
&gt;&gt;2376164
bloody hell i am down A LOT todayXVG, STRAT, DGB, STEEM, RADS, WAVES, FLDC, MLN, and i was shorting GRC right when it fucking pumps reeat least i got in before the pumps on most of them and have hope for the usefulness of about half
&gt;&gt;2376186I sold it my man. Maybe my post could have been clearer
&gt;&gt;2376259When I buy a coin, I know that I am keeping it for at least 6 months. I am not some ADHD-ridden &quot;&quot;&quot;trader&quot;&quot;&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2376131I made money on it, but youd have to be crazy to have bought this at any point after it took offIt&#039;s a scamcoin that&#039;s only supposed use was on a heavily modded minecraft server. There was never any chance of it being in official esports.What exactly justifies this ridiculous market capI&#039;m honestly surprised it went this high
&gt;&gt;2376328And notice no one gives a fuck about the minecraft server which came out today.DGB is the biggest farce in crypto currency history.
&gt;&gt;2376120I tried my very best to warn them. The /biz/ regulars fell for the coordinated efforts of big shills. You can still get out guys... Sell at a slight loss, it will not recover. I&#039;m so sorry.
I&#039;ll just be over here..Buying all the rock-bottom priced DGB for after the correction. I mean, does NO ONE notice that all alts take a hit when btc or eth rises? The weakhands selling is just icing on my low-priced diamond cake.
wats happening to waves?
Is now a good time to get in STRAT and WAVES or abandon ship?
lokk at those order books
What the fuck I thought I bought low then it tanks another 20%. What the fuck
i&#039;m almost down 50% since i bought....don&#039;t know what to believe anymore with shitcoins.
&gt;&gt;2375427&gt;&gt;2375461what is this pajeetcoin?
&gt;tfw bought the &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;dip&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; at 8300
&gt;&gt;2375461I&#039;m going to tell you a little secret about investing that hopefully sticks with you for the rest of your lifeJust because something *was* a good investment, doesn&#039;t mean it *is* still a good investment. There&#039;s a time to buy, and a time to sell. &quot;HODL&quot; is not always your best course. Take it with a grain of salt, but my point is don&#039;t expect to do well if you buy every ATH just because it&#039;s buzzing. People have often bought long before you.
&gt;&gt;2375427&gt;Be me&gt;Looking for a non PnD coin to buy.&gt;Whoa this looks like a pretty stable investment and it&#039;s on sale right now :^)&gt;Continues droppingDid i fuck up?
&gt;&gt;2375900Bought at 6984 sat btw
&gt;&gt;2375900the difference between being &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;ahead of its time&quot; is often just 2 yearsin crypto terms, that&#039;s 2 monthshodl
&gt;&gt;2375427Bought yesterday&#039;s low at 7552. Fuck.
&gt;&gt;2375900Lol.Nem is the most stable voin in this market. The whole market could bw going to shit and nem wont be bothered.It fluctuates between 18-24 cents but it bounces back to 20-21 cents.It hopefully moons with catapult this summer. This coin has almost 0 marketing which in its own is amazing because it managed to become top 4 without marketing.
Good thing I only own a tiny 45 XEMs
this shitcoin is fkin useless, it has no project and no application, it is dead and its not going to rise more than thatget out man or wait to recover your losses
Down 40% on this, not ATH bought.Stratis down also like 40%, just fuck my shit up senpai.
FUCK THIS GAY COIN ALONG WITH RIPPLE.THE ONLY 2 FUCKERS FROM TOP COINS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY DROPPING FOR A WHOLE FUCKING WEEK.I&#039;M THIS CLOSE TO SELLING.FUCK.
&gt;&gt;2376287time for me to buy both then
&gt;&gt;2376330You&#039;re better off waiting for 5,5-6k level for NEM and 8k for Ripple. I&#039;ve looked at charts and TAs and they&#039;re predicting an even lower price. Do as you wish though.I believe in both projects but fuck, watching your portfolio be cut in half is depressing(especially for Ripple since there has been some good news lately but this nigger just keeps going down for some reason).
Its over, isnt it?
Yes. It is, sadly. At this point, it won&#039;t go above 1400 and is likely to plummet a LOT more when people are tired of holding bags.
yes it&#039;s over.wait until good news.
I hope people panic sell all the way down to 100 sats so I can get more of these
&gt;&gt;2375806No one will buy based on fake DGB news again. The citibank thing was a farce. The Minecraft server a TOTAL joke.
&gt;&gt;2375765Isn&#039;t it over?
&gt;Denial and isolation&gt;Anger&gt;Bargaining&gt;Depression&gt;AcceptanceThe 5 stages of Digibyte, glad to know you guys finally are at 5
&gt;&gt;2375818Dude is this a fucking joke?
&gt;&gt;2375765you tell me?
Doing pretty well senpai. I literally can&#039;t even lose.
&gt;&gt;2375864It&#039;s not DGB market cap you nigger
&gt;&gt;2375859Why would it be?
&gt;&gt;2375885How many thousands have you lost the last 3 days?
I FUCKED UP AND FORGOT TO SELL BEFORE THE NEWS AS PLANNEDCAN ANYONE POST GUIDES ON HOW TO TIE A NOOSE??
&gt;&gt;2375765You know the FUD spammers are the exact same people as the MOON spammers right? how fucking new are you people?
&gt;&gt;2375932None, because it&#039;s not real money.
&gt;&gt;2375922&gt;Taking someone&#039;s bagsVery generous my dude
&gt;&gt;2375818I would buy back in at my original price of 300 sats. Coin has potential if the dev team isn&#039;t completely demoralized, but it isn&#039;t anything better than a $50 spec play at this point.That said, I&#039;d like to thank /biz/ for bringing DGB to my attention back in May. I 7xed my investment and just made an offer on a house thanks to DGB.
&gt;sinked 1/3 of my portfolio into this at 1800 sats based on the CitiBank farceREEEEEEEEEEEE I WANNA STOP BEING A GAINLET HOW THE FUCK DO I STOP FALLING FOR SCAMS
Citibank announces the winner in July, so it&#039;ll jump or somehow drop even lower.
&gt;&gt;2375973DGB is over dude, the dev team are a joke. Jared is a fucking autistic joke. His presentation looked PATHETIC.
&gt;&gt;2376050LMAO do you idiots really believe this bullshit?Who is going to fall for the Citibank hype again?They lost the competition. Period.
BUY HIGH SELL LOW
&gt;&gt;2376033BUY ARKBUY LISKBUY STRATYOU CAN GO ALL IN. SELL YOUR DGB AND BUY THOSE 3 NOOWWWWW
Finally pulled the plug. Hands can only be so strong. Learned some valuable lessons at least.
&gt;&gt;2376073&gt;&gt;2376053Why are you so desperate for people to sell their bags?
&gt;&gt;2376087I&#039;m only speaking the truth, how am I desperate? People are selling this trash regardless. Best to mitigate losses instead of waiting until it plummets more, as I&#039;m sure many did (and have learned their lesson).This garbage is going down below 1000 sats, just wait little buddy.
&gt;&gt;2376050&gt;Fucking huge picture of a boat taking up the whole slide&gt;Plain black text on a white background without any design flair whatsoeverThis is what people on /biz/ have unironically invested in.
&gt;&gt;2376076STRATARKboth on suicide watch
&gt;&gt;2376084Good job. Hopefully you made a bit; if not, you&#039;ve learned your lesson.Don&#039;t ever believe autistic fucking idiots like Jared Tate ever again - don&#039;t fall for BS hype, or you will pay for it.
&gt;&gt;2376102Sell you my bags at 500? what kind of retard would do that?
&gt;&gt;2375765Its not over until its over
&gt;&gt;2375959Why though?&gt;&gt;2375973Bought at 100 sats. No fugs given about this correction, more news and competitions coming up in July, and Jared has talked to several companies. Though it might take a few weeks or even months, I&#039;m convinced that DGB will shatter 3000 sats.
&gt;&gt;2376129Ok, then don&#039;t, and it will go down to 100 sats. Your choice. It&#039;s going to keep plummeting and there is NOTHING anyone can do. Confidence is SHATTERED. Trust in DGB is GONE.
&gt;tfw there are more awards that will be announced in July&gt;tfw DGB could win the award where you get the chance to present to nigerian or columbia government officials&gt;the same thing happens again with a different presentation&gt;gets hyped up and pumped up again till we reach 4000 this time&gt;the fall is even greater this timeI hope they get that prize, I&#039;m looking forward to it.
&gt;&gt;2376141Dude. Jared is an autistic retard, those companies probably laugh and make fun of him when he leaves the board room.No one is buying the Citibank competition hype again. Not like DGB will win it anyways. Sell and move on. You can still make a nice profit if you sell now instead of waiting, and then have it plummet to 500 sats.
&gt;&gt;2376108This is the part that hurts me the most.I bought in at 100 sats, I feel totally fine with my gains and my bags right now.But seriously? He couldn&#039;t put 5 minutes into his fucking POWERPOINT presentation to make it look better than a first year university student?I sold off 1/3 of my stash the moment I verified the authenticity of this image desu.
&gt;&gt;2376147Jared was happy about there being a 5 million dollar award, what does that tell you?No one gives a rat&#039;s ass about these competitions anymore. Not only did DGB prove to be unwinnable because the product and presentation is farcical, but trust and confidence in this shitcoin is totally eroded.
&gt;&gt;2376147&gt;tfw DGB could win the award where you get the chance to present to nigerian or columbia government officialsWow, what a two superpowers
&gt;&gt;2376152&gt;Sell and move on.
&gt;be me&gt;keep looking at sell orders&gt;it&#039;s a bunch of panic sell retardsLmfao.I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re letting the Whales rape you guys this hard.
&gt;&gt;2375938-25$? are you serious because if you are then kys you&#039;ll never make it in the world
&gt;&gt;2376113I lost a bit, but nothing that will keep me up at night. Im still quite new so I dont have a lot of money in the game yet.
&gt;&gt;2376143First 1000 now 100? fine I&#039;ll sell the bags when it reaches 0.00000001 sats alright.
&gt;&gt;2376200tfw i lost about 5 bucks, What am I even doing here
The good thing is I bought at 329 sats, so I won&#039;t be going into the red anytime soon. The bad thing is I&#039;m on vacation until Sunday and my DGB is stored on my core wallet on my PC at home, otherwise I would&#039;ve sold yesterday.
&gt;&gt;2376187Ok, then keep losing money. Your choice. You can still recover now, in a week this will be ~500 sats tops.&gt;&gt;2376190How dumb do you have to be to think this is some sort of &quot;whale&quot; manipulation? It&#039;s totally organic. People realized this piece of SHIT coin isn&#039;t worth anything, that Jared is a fucking retarded autist who can&#039;t even make a decent powerpoint, and that they never deliver on their laughable products.Please tell me how digibytegaming is going?
&gt;&gt;2376108should just have talked about dgbchan, literally the only decent thing about this coin
&gt;&gt;2376073The CitiBank comp wasn&#039;t even the special thing about this coin IT WAS ONLY A PLUS AND IT STILL A PLUS BECAUSE HE EXPOSED HIMSELF AND WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO SEVERAL LARGW COMPANIESYOU GUYS ARE ALL SO FUCKINGS STUPID THERE IS NOT ONE COMPANY ON EARTH THAT HASNT FAILED TO SUCCEEDIF THE DEVS OF DGB ARE IN PURSUIT OF SUCCESS THEY WILL KEPE TRYING. WHY? BC THEY DONT WANT TO BE POORFAGS LIKE YOUITS THE ONLY GANING CRYPTO ARE YOU ALL AUTISTS????
&gt;&gt;2376033&gt;half the threads on /biz/ for the entire last 2 weeks were&gt;DIGIBYTE TO THE MOON&gt;BUY&gt;BUY&gt;BUYA dumb brainlet frogposter and his money are soon parted
&gt;&gt;2376246Jared, pls. Try to save the rest ofyour shitcoin instead of shitposting
&gt;&gt;2376246This is a different game, every time Jared the Autist fails, confidence in this shitcoin is eroded.How much did you lose the last 2 days? lol you sound upset.
&gt;&gt;2376288LMFAO yeah that may well be Jared the Autist. What a dumb motherfucker with a pathetic product.Think Jared suicides within the next few days? He, and his product are dismal failures.
&gt;&gt;2376163&gt;to make it look better than a first year university student?Are you retarded? That&#039;s some middle school tier shit. Even in high school the powerpoints were good. They clearly put no time in making their slides look presentable, they&#039;re a joke.
&gt;&gt;2376246DGB is going to zero and never coming back. those devs will find another project. calm down autist.
WE WUZ
its fucking going all the way this time

Who would the &quot;schemer&quot; even be? The developer? The large bagholders? I mean a P&amp;D/bubble/failed crypto company isn&#039;t a ponzi scheme.

&gt;&gt;2374718Jesus fucking Christ the faggots on this website are horrendous and you guys make fun of Reddit? lmfao fucking loser.
money is not a prerequisite to getting womenif you wait until you&#039;re rich before you start approaching women you&#039;re going to have the skills of a 13 year old in a 40 year olds body
&gt;&gt;2374775Fuck off back to 1eddit, faggot.
&gt;&gt;2374792Women are biologically attracted to protection and power. Money does both of that. Women also like being lazy and sunny destinations. Money allows this. Money is a natural pussy moisturizer whether you like it or not. There is absolutely no woman that would say no to sucking your dick in front of a briefcase loaded to the top with $100 bills. NO woman will say no. The biggest dyke sjw wearing flannel would happily suck the cum from your balls just to be around that much money.
&gt;&gt;2374680&gt;look I posted it again
Garbage manSo you can get used to the lifestyle after divorce
Whatever amount would result in alimony in the millions.The more money you have the less reason there is to be associate with women beyond the short term.
I sometimes like saggy tits...easier for tit fucking.Regarding the net worth, maybe at least 1/2 mil and if you are good looking. If not, at least 2 mils.
&gt;&gt;2375838What if I am tall, jacked, but with a young and boyish face?
Lease it
&gt;&gt;2375863try to grow a beard. That fixes it. If you can&#039;t, well dress better (suits,shirts and shit).It&#039;s all about perception, fake it till you make it.
&gt;&gt;2374718yea she is too old.
&gt;&gt;2374680I have a gf like that and my networth is 1k
&gt;&gt;2375583If you need to pay women to be with you, why do you want a wife? Just get a prostitute.
&gt;&gt;2376005&gt;lying on /biz/Let us be real, buddy boy. If you even know what 4chan is, you don&#039;t have a gf like that.
&gt;&gt;2375896&gt;try to grow a beard. That fixes it.The problem is...I can&#039;t grow a beard...even at age of 30. My bear is pathetic.I already dress in bespoke suits, but people still think I&#039;m just some young rich dude and not an actual /biz/nessman. Women avoid me.
Ok /biz/ I&#039;m not bullshitting or meme&#039;ing here. I will give $1000 (0.35btc) to anyone who can tell me how to use my skills to make a few million dollars by the end of this year. My skills are in programming and design and I have at least 5 years experience working in those fields, however I&#039;m a complete beta autist when it comes to interacting with people.And if your idea does make me millions, I will pay you $100k (35btc). It has to be a feasible, well thought out plan and it can&#039;t involve anything illegal or excessively degenerate. Post your premise here and if it sounds feasible we can talk further.

&gt;&gt;2374981This isn&#039;t really doable anymore. The market for smartphone games is oversaturated and there&#039;s almost no money in it anymore for anybody who isn&#039;t already established at the top.&gt;&gt;2374989I certainly will if I see an original idea that sounds like it may actually work.&gt;&gt;2374994I have about $60k in crypto right now, but I don&#039;t expect that to grow into the millions by the end of the year.&gt;&gt;2375008&gt;make a trading exchangeThis is an interesting idea that I&#039;ve thought about doing, but I&#039;m not sure what the regulatory consequences would be. I live in the US and it seems there are laws around operating an exchange.&gt;make an ICOLooked into this too, but again, there&#039;s all sorts of regulation and due diligence shit that has to be done and I have no understanding of those things.&gt;&gt;2375038Yeah, but the thing is that I&#039;m capable of doing the work of those 2 or 3 people. I&#039;ve worked at a few startups before and always had to do other peoples&#039; work for them because nobody ever pulled their own weight.&gt;&gt;2375028&gt;celebritiesThat&#039;s pretty degenerate, no thanks.&gt;&gt;2375047I don&#039;t have the capital to invest in real estate.
&gt;&gt;2375108&gt;Looked into this too, but again, there&#039;s all sorts of regulation and due diligence shit that has to be done and I have no understanding of those things.&gt;wants to make a million dollars&gt;does not want to expend any effortyou&#039;re shit outta luck then faggot
&gt;&gt;2375053&gt;add it to an exchangeDoesn&#039;t this cost a lot of money? And even then only the shitty low-volume exchanges will add coins if you pay them.Also, I&#039;d like to develop some kind of coin, but I don&#039;t have any original, feasible ideas for one. That&#039;s why I&#039;m asking for specific ideas.
&gt;&gt;2375108I take it the startup wasn&#039;t successful at all then, imagine for once the quality of a product you could deliver working with a team on par with you
&gt;&gt;2375108&gt;but you have to like learn an do stuff...Kek. Buy $60k worth of lottery tickets then.
&gt;&gt;2374928Make an Android/IOS game with microtransactions.
&gt;&gt;2374928See this is why autists need a Chad to work under.
&gt;&gt;2375141No, I&#039;m willing to expend lots of effort if it&#039;s in an area I have expertise in, or if it&#039;s something that can be learned. With ICO&#039;s I&#039;ve tried to do some research, but I haven&#039;t been able to find any concrete information on the subject. It almost seems like you need to be on the inside and already know people in crypto to get an ICO off the ground. Please enlighten me if I&#039;m wrong.&gt;&gt;2375175Theoretically yeah, but I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. Teams are always going to be shit.
&gt;&gt;2375148I have a couple of ideas, OP. Email me with a throwaway: aglannol@protonmail.com
&gt;&gt;2375191Not sure where you got the idea from that I don&#039;t want to learn or do anything. Learning is my favorite thing, and if I could actually do that while making money, that would be the ideal situation for me.
&gt;&gt;2374928I have an idea that is only missing my beta autist programmer. I&#039;ve had programmers want to work on it but couldn&#039;t because their jobs got in the way. Have a lawyer willing to work for free for stake in the company when I eventually get the ball rolling. Are you my programmer? HMU on kik if you want - bushwickbi, yes i use it for sexytimes. Prove it&#039;s you by posting the last 3 letters of your username here before messaging me.
&gt;&gt;2375206&gt;Teams are always going to be shitMuch later in life you&#039;ll realize how wrong you were and why you never realized your dream of millions
&gt;&gt;2375330Do those sites actually make money? They look like shit and could easily be recreated in a weekend.&gt;&gt;2375349The older I get, the more I realize it&#039;s true though. I used to think teams were great back when I was first starting out in my mid 20s, but after actually working with people I&#039;ve realized nobody gives a shit about anything but themselves and I&#039;ve become very jaded on the subject.
&gt;&gt;2375251&gt;if you want something done right, you have to do it yourselfThis attitude will be a problem getting anywhere. If you&#039;re willing to learn - then learn people skills first and foremost. Running any kind of business will require many different areas of expertise that no single person would ever be able to be proficient at simply physically, no matter how smart. Human capital is everything in this world. It&#039;s your investors, your clients, your employees. It&#039;s the constant swarm of ideas and opportunities around you. Having a great business idea is worthless unless you can actually bring it to life and knowing people in every sense is the one way to do it. You honestly should have already grown out of the autistic Dr. House style delusions by the time you&#039;re making that salary.

&gt;&gt;2375473&gt;then learn people skillsI can&#039;t, I&#039;m an autist. It&#039;s basically a mental disability with no treatment available. Thinking I can just &quot;learn people skills&quot; is delusional and isn&#039;t going to get me anywhere in life.&gt;constant swarm of ideasI haven&#039;t seen one viable idea in this thread, let alone out there in the world &quot;around me&quot;. Good ideas are really fucking hard to come by. The execution of a product, at least in software, is the easiest part once you actually have a good idea.
If I was you I would make my own coin. There is still time to succeed especially if the idea of the coin is new and interesting. I mean there are coins that do absolutely nothing or basically the same as bitcoin and have millions in marketcap. One of your skills is programming, you probably have friends or acquaintances that are programmers. Making it possible to set up a team to create a coin. Your other skill is design, meaning you have the creative capacity to develop a coin. I honestly think this is a plausible option for you.Hope this helped and seems like the right option!15iXCxH2LfMz8xP47EUWGGaQdtLSho2a5F
Make a kikestarter, advertise it appropriately, make your product.
&gt;&gt;2375590I think I do have the ability to do this, but I&#039;m unable to find any resources on the business side of things (ICO&#039;s, getting listed on an exchange, etc). Also, I don&#039;t have any good ideas for what the coin could do. Not sure if just copying another coin would make any money.
&gt;&gt;2375586&gt;&gt;then train your muscles&gt;I can&#039;t, I&#039;m weak. It&#039;s basically a physical disability. Thinking I can just &quot;train my muscles&quot; is delusional and isn&#039;t going to get me anywhere in life.I&#039;m beginning to suspect this whole thread is just fishing for (You)&#039;s.
Depending on your level of programming knowledge I wold look in to starting my own coin. Your morals may be questioned here but there are a lot of coins out there with &#039;reused&#039; code. You have the knowledge in programming and design to facilitate the majority of this on your own. Woke with someone who can assist with the people side of things such as social media. A simple coin (1 billion supply, no premine) with no bullshit will do well. There are a lot of coins out there currently saying they are bringing the latest and unique ideas to the crypto world with no promises. Your coin does not need this. The Ethereum blockchain is becoming increasingly promising. Good luck OP
&gt;&gt;2375676&gt;comparing the inner workings of the human brain, the most complex biological organ in existence, to the simple cell multiplication and expansion that happens from basic mechanical stimulation of muscle fibersI hope you&#039;re trolling.
&gt;&gt;2375639OP, guy with the email address here. Hope you aren&#039;t ignoring meee aglannol@protonmail.com . I have tentative game plans you may find interesting. Ok that was last post.
&gt;&gt;2375729I would be able to handle social media stuff myself. I have no problem with human interaction when given the time to type out my thoughts and don&#039;t have to physically interact with anybody. What exactly is a &quot;simple coin&quot; though?
&gt;&gt;2374928Bro! I got just the thing!We take The Novacoin code,clone it, replace any mention of Novacoin with our own coin name, and say we have a genius Uzbeki developer who was invented a new conses algorithm and p2p network technology. we have an ico at 1 satoshi, in which we buy 75% of the coins, and then slowly bleed the crypto community dry with mundane readme file commits and comments randomly inserted into the code.We can call XtraKikes. (XKS)
Develope an app that shows hot girls that work at gas stations... or an add on to something like wayz. Id like an advance please 1KMmTGTxnEjMQ2wyh4GPzhSPdNZATg1n2S
I could give you an idea. But why would I give you something worth millions in exchange for a paltry 101k?I&#039;ll split it with you, maybe we make a million each.
&gt;&gt;2375779Simple may not have been the best word to use. I feel that right now, a coin that didn&#039;t promise the world would do well. A coin that was just that, a coin. A cryptocurrency that may actually be usable as a form of payment in the near future. No hidden info or empty promises.
&gt;&gt;2375108&gt;oversaturatedconfirmed for fucking retard. you&#039;ll never be rich.
&gt;&gt;2374928EMA crossover algorithm.Fuck you pay me.
&gt;&gt;2375881I wouldn&#039;t be against this if it&#039;s a fair split and we each contribute exactly the same amount of work to it.
&gt;&gt;2375732&gt;but muh completely unrelated bullshit excuseDear god, I&#039;m struggling to believe you&#039;re not a larping /r9k/ teenager. Every skill is trainable. Go make a fucking effort instead of whining on a board. Yes, you&#039;re likely not going to be the great fucking Gatsby. Yes, you can absolutely be good with people if you put in the work instead of making childish excuses for your own fear and laziness.
&gt;&gt;2375108How much have you really looked into making an exchange though op? It would be difficult legally, security wise and effortwise. But I believe a simple minimalist eth backed exchange (as opposed to btc) would be killer. Dude polo makes over half a million dollars a day in trading fees alone going off the volume posted.Message back if interested in exploring further. I also could contribute a lot. Sounds like were in a similar position.
If you know c++ learn unity and unreal and get into virtual reality. Shits hot like crypto.
&gt;&gt;2375891But why would anybody want to use it over any other coin? What would be the selling point?&gt;&gt;2375901Have you actually looked at the app store and google play store in the last few years? Right now there are literally 2000 different fidget spinner apps that look and behave exactly identical to each other.&gt;&gt;2375930Autism is not treatable. Find me one example of an autist who was able to overcome it and become a successful &quot;people person&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2375255Now I&#039;m curious too, I&#039;m gonna msg you
&gt;&gt;2376026Sorry meant to quote&gt;&gt;2375952instead of&gt;&gt;2375930
&gt;&gt;2375935&gt;&gt;2375935Of course, that is what contracts are for.
&gt;&gt;2376026&gt;app storedon&#039;t talk about shit you don&#039;t understand. the mentality doesn&#039;t stop at the fucking app store, anybody who uses the word &quot;oversaturated&quot; for a growing market can suck a dick and go back to slaving away for some incompetent boss.
Make a crypto, set issuance so that marketcap is still over 1 million at 1 sat. Pay fee to yobit to get listed. Put up tiny sell walls to attract pump and dump groups. Dump on their asses when they get buy orders set up for a few BTC. Rinse and repeat with multiple coins.
&gt;&gt;2374928Not sure how doable this is, but you should try and create an index fund for the top 10-20 coins, and set it up the trade like an etf. It will be like vanguard of crypto.
&gt;&gt;2375935here is my email if you are serioussandwichbotguy@gmail.com
&gt;&gt;2376052Apple app store downloads have been pretty much flat for years now and google play download count isn&#039;t that relevant because it&#039;s mostly pajeets and other 3rd worlders who are contributing towards that, and they don&#039;t spend any money on apps, nor do advertisers pay anything to reach them.What apps have you made recently that have netted you millions of dollars?
&gt;&gt;2376088This is an intriguing idea, but it looks like yobit doesn&#039;t actually guarantee that your coin will be listed even if you pay them the 0.5btc.&gt;&gt;2376093Too much regulation around that to be able to do it without having huge amount of capital.
&gt;&gt;2376026&gt;conflating internet slang with actual medical conditionYou&#039;re not a very smart person, are you.
&gt;&gt;2376168It&#039;s a spectrum disorder, and I&#039;m definitely somewhere on that spectrum. I have no problem with calling myself an autist, even if that&#039;s not the &quot;correct&quot; medial term for it.
&gt;&gt;2376155Of course they don&#039;t &quot;guarantee&quot; it standard legal bullshit. Still they seemingly do list them all anyways, I mean there&#039;s tons of coins on there without any information on the coin able to be found anywhere.
&gt;&gt;2376123&gt;my market analysis of a massive global industry includes a bar graph with 6 data points and an assumption about how indians download more apps&gt;i want to be a millionairehalf of those pajeets are better programmers than you, and aren&#039;t mentally retarded. i hired an &quot;elite&quot; programmer for 10k over 3 months. what does your resume look like?
&gt;&gt;2374928&gt;a few million dollars by the end of this yearSlow and steady wins the race, mate. Get a job, job hop every two years for a 30-80% salary increase. Save 80% of your income, invest in 65% stock index funds, 25% bond funds, 10% play money (individual stocks, REIT, more crypto, startup investing, peer to peer, ...)I don&#039;t want your money. I want you to consider a solid track instead of a hype.
&gt;&gt;2376213&gt;half of those pajeets are better programmers than youStopped reading there. You sound like a larper who&#039;s never actually worked with indians or even in the industry at all. And you never answered my question. What game have you sold recently on an app store that&#039;s brought in at least $1 million in revenue?
&gt;&gt;2376213Seconding this.If you don&#039;t have a 6-figure day job or freelance job as a programmer atm, you&#039;re not that good at programming.Design should pay you between $40 and $150 an hour. I am a freelance designer at the very bottom of the skill scale (and I suck at self-management too) and I earn $45/hour.
Make an actually good game and pay a niche streamer to play it. Use ads to speed up in game processes and have often periodic deals. Doesn&#039;t need to be complicated just simple but smart
&gt;&gt;2374928&gt;&gt;2375779Based on your post, you indeed are a literal autist that doesn&#039;t have a clue how to interact with people, most especially a business partner. Just because you can type your thoughts out doesn&#039;t mean those thoughts are any good at conveying any type of message or meaning.Second of all, you did not even specify what languages you know, how well you know them, or provide any idea of your previous work. Link a portfolio, what the hell can you build? Back end? Front end? What type of design? Do you even understand design? Why should I believe you.I&#039;m a successful entrepreneur and CEO. Why should I just give you one of my ideas and in return I get a small pittance of the profit and you make millions? How do you plan to market this &quot;future thing&quot; you&#039;ve built? How do you plan to get people excited about this &quot;idea that you&#039;re going to build.&quot; Why is anything you do going to be better? How many hours are you ready to put in? What is &quot;equal work&quot;? If you&#039;re only paid 80k a year right now, and I am closing deals that are worth 10s of millions, but I&#039;m spending half the time that you do, then whose work is more valuable?What are your interests? How many products have you brought to market? Things that make millions solve millions of people&#039;s problems (most usually), do you understand people&#039;s problems?If you&#039;re just in it for money, just build a day trading python bot and put it work on currencies. Second of all if you really want to be taken seriously then link your github, what the hell can you even do?
&gt;&gt;2376268&gt;job hop every two years for a 30-80% salary increaseThat&#039;s not how it works though. There&#039;s a limit to how much you can be paid as a wagecuck, and it&#039;s pretty low. For example, as a programmer you&#039;re probably never going to make much more than $150k/year. There are exceptions of course, but they&#039;re very rare and usually involve working more in management than actually programming.&gt;&gt;2376314I do though. I was making $120k/year in 2016, but I left that for a 100% remote job that pays $80k/year and consumes much less of my time. I basically work for 10 hours a week while looking like I work a full 40 hours. But it&#039;s still wagecuckery and a shitty thing to have to waste any amount of time on.
&gt;&gt;2376293says the guy who doesn&#039;t know how to use his &quot;skills,&quot; doesn&#039;t know how to talk to people, and thinks that millionaires are made overnight.any ownership of a business goes out the window with your self diagnosed brain damage and negative attitude. your options as a regular dipshit computer guy are to get into a startup with equity, or to become an angel investor with a technical advantage. don&#039;t bother making another excuse, there are literally billions of people like you and you&#039;re predictable as fuck.
&gt;&gt;2376192&gt;here&#039;s a bullshit label to excuse yourself never trying hard enoughThanks for actually confirming being an /r9k/ teen. This thread was mildly entertaining. Keep it on your home board next time, though, please.
&gt; you put out an ad on a gay porn site&gt; latest and greatest in intrusive dildos&gt; &quot;does what no other can do until now&quot;&gt; &quot;latest and greatest in sexual technology&quot;&gt; &quot;guaranteed results or your money back&quot; - all of that nonsense&gt; such dildos cost $70 a pop - a snip for the pleasure they&#039;re giving the recipients&gt; after a period of perhaps 2-3 days after the buyer&#039;s money clears&gt; you send the buyer a cheque to their address as a refund with the company name on it&gt; Ass Tickler&#039;s Faggot Fan Club&gt; you apologise saying you couldn&#039;t get the supplies and they&#039;re out of stock&gt; now you see how many people cash that cheque&gt; not a single soul&gt; because who wants their bank manager to know they tickle ass when they&#039;re not paying in cheques... :3
&gt;&gt;2376380&gt;I was making $120k/year in 2016For how long? If you&#039;ve had a job (assuming starting at $50k) since 2012 and knew about saving &amp; investing, the bull market should have brought you very close to a million already. Peeps with $80k year are at $700k saved and invested.

Ledger kicked him off the session, reset itself, and required his keyphrase to get back in.He didn&#039;t write the phrase because he was making a video at the same time promoting the ledger.So it&#039;s his fault for not writing down the pass, and ledgers fault for erroring out and resetting.

&gt;&gt;2371762Denying reality doesn&#039;t make you more mature, no matter how much society wants you to. A white and a black are about as equal as a German Shepherd and a pitbull
&gt;&gt;2371762&gt;I&#039;ve just matured to the point where I don&#039;t waste time being mad at people because they look different than me.Codeword for &quot;I&#039;m twenty years old&quot;.I used to get mad at people like you. Then I realised you are the real-life bagholders. We need a large amount of society to keep welcoming diversity, to keep believing demographics isn&#039;t destiny long enough for those of us who feel differently to cash out to better places.
&gt;&gt;2371818Racism doesn&#039;t exist you nigger. It&#039;s a meme.
&gt;&gt;2371735probably because america&#039;s history is &quot;let&#039;s make everything great but specifically fuck black people&quot;It&#039;s a simple fact that Wealth and lack of wealth is sticky.If you have wealth and status you are more likely to keep it.If you are poor and have low status you are likely to stay there.Things were changing for better ie real equality until the war on drugs and blacksploitation in the media turned cultural aspects of poverty and low status into cultural identities.

&gt;&gt;2371885Black people wouldn&#039;t even be in America if not for white people. Say thanks.
&gt;&gt;2371881No its not
&gt;&gt;2371881sure, you&#039;ll grow up some day

&gt;&gt;2371885Yeah sure man, whitey is responsible for the failures of nignogs EVERYWHERE, from all of Africa to Baltimore to Haiti, the only times blacks have been off well has been under direct white rule
&gt;&gt;2371885&gt;&gt;2371896In fact it wasn&#039;t whites who brought blacks to USA but JEWS. (pic related)So say it with me:(((((THANKS))))))Whites literally fought a war and died about 625k to free blacks
&gt;&gt;2371895&gt;Pitt Bulls are good dogs, they din du nuffin
&gt;&gt;2371921There is literally no racism in real life outside of the internet. Except for racism against whites in college campuses.
&gt;&gt;2371520&gt;I&#039;m a nigger
&gt;&gt;2371949ah yes, the college republican snowflake cucks who can&#039;t defend themselves.
And to be honest, Trevor isn&#039;t even dumb. He looks pretty average. So stop complaining about &#039;muh racism&#039;.
&gt;&gt;2371949I[ m very racist but as long as a black is respectful to me, I&#039;m respectful back. There&#039;s no need to cause unnecessary conflict everywhere. Blacks are to be orderly deported in due time
&gt;&gt;2371977&gt;who can&#039;t defend themselvesIf they have to defend themselves, then this means that they&#039;re under attack.
&gt;&gt;2371946&gt;mfw my smiling doggo isn&#039;t even on the chart
&gt;&gt;2371985&gt;He doesn&#039;t know about LiberiaGood luck deporting black people when America lost it&#039;s identity and demographics ages ago

&gt;&gt;2371885&gt;Asians come to America with less possessions than Blacks&gt;Asians are discriminated against by affirmative action at an even worse rate than whites&gt;Asians suffer from more racism and are still considered as &quot;foreign&quot; even in 2017&gt;Asians still succeedModern American black culture is definitely a problem. But culture is derived from the individuals part of it. Blacks are responsible for refusing to accept responsibility for their actions in a society supposedly defined by the expression of individualism. Whites are responsible for their suicidal pathological altruism reinforcing negative behaviors. Asians are responsible for not asking for handouts aggressively.In a twisted way, Jews might be the most virtuous of all. They might be sick genocidal bastards, but they do so in order to ensure complete domination of their ingroup. Our biological purpose is perpetuation, therefore any strategy securing your place at the top of the food chain is ultimately noble.Then again, their policies have a slight chance of leading into global wars or other apocalyptic scenarios, which is a pretty dumb gamble to make long-term.

Have there ever been problems with the Nano Passphrase? Any glitches that prevent it from working, maybe? I know it&#039;s farfetch&#039;d but I have one arriving soon and want to make sure it works 100% before putting my ETH on it.Is there a private key included or is the 24 word passphrase the only private key?
&gt;&gt;2372445No one asked you, faggot.
I can&#039;t even this thread right now. GET A FREAKING LIFE YOU WHITE LOSERS
&gt;&gt;2372433Perhaps if you stopped giving /pol/ so much credit everything would go back to normal.
&gt;&gt;2372425&gt;I know it was my responsibility but the white man should pay meTypical African-American mentality.
&gt;&gt;2372452I got a Nano S and it guides you through it on the display on that model and shows you the passphrase on the display, you then write it down on a card it comes with. For the Nano I&#039;m not sure. You probably still need the chrome extension.&gt;&gt;2372486pic related mongrel
&gt;&gt;2372526Ok so as long as you remember the 24 wd passphrase and your public address your coins should be safe no matter what?
&gt;&gt;2372511i felt bad for him until it turned out half the video was begging for free money to replace his free money.
Stop making /biz/ political
&gt;&gt;2372545yes you fucking protect that phrase, store in multiple secure locations AWAY from the ledger device
&gt;&gt;2372561Would it be a good idea to purposely wipe the device (IE entering the pin wrong 3 times) after configuring it to test the passphrase out?
&gt;&gt;2372572fuck yes
&gt;&gt;2371382
&gt;&gt;2372577waitwaitwait, i have only used the blue, the nano gets entered via computer? better make sure its a clean machine
&gt;&gt;2371365&gt;3:20&gt;Invests in Dash because the logos bluePeople like this deserve to lose everything.
&gt;&gt;2372585no, it comes with a screen on the device itself. You can use it on a compromised computer and be 100% safe.
I think he has the Nano and not the Nano S
&gt;&gt;2372594how do you reenter the phrase though? on that little screen?
&gt;&gt;2372629Yes. It has 2 buttons and you scroll through letters with them, then press both at the same time to move to the next letter.&gt;&gt;2372585They claim on their site that it can be used on a compromised computer. Pic related is from the Nano page of their site.
&gt;&gt;2371365Niggers are filthy parasites, I&#039;d be willing to bet he stole that ledger nano and he is trying to get someone to break in for him.
&gt;&gt;2372629Actually that&#039;s how you enter the PIN, I&#039;m not sure how you enter the 24 word passphrase.
&gt;&gt;2372673it&#039;s entered on the device as well.
&gt;&gt;2372663It&#039;s insane. Skip half way into the video and watch him whine about why ledger should pay him 3BTC because he made a shitty review about their product, in which he trashed. So indicative of black people today - Can never take responsibility, it&#039;s always someone elses fault and constantly looking for the gibsmedat&#039;s.
&gt;&gt;2372697Oh okay cool. I thought that may be the case but didn&#039;t want to say it as though it were fact.
&gt;&gt;2372697ah yeah ok test it out for sure i&#039;m seeing no reason why anyone wouldnt do that&gt;&gt;2372713yeah half way is where it starts its a fucking joke, manages to fuck up a free fucking ride and is talking about insiders at ledger and shit. anyway if he stayed in crypto since then hes probably fine
&gt;&gt;2372741And if you lose the device you can enter the passphrase on another Ledger wallet or on a &quot;BIP39 compatible software wallet&quot;
&gt;&gt;2372770yeah I was going to say in the case the ledger is actually lost, say its stolen, is there an online wallet that can be used in a hurry to move funds? just punch in address and phrase?
&gt;&gt;2371489&gt;posts pic of Donald Trump tossing a redditor outTrumpfags are the biggest redditors on 4chan. The fact that you don&#039;t realize he was trolling proves you&#039;re one of them. Get the fuck out, nigger.
&gt;&gt;2372792The two software wallets they mention are &quot;Multibit HD or Mycelium&quot;. You can also look here for more info http://support.ledgerwallet.com/help_center
I watch alot of his vids and he is openly raceist dosnt bother me i am too, open racisim is honesty
&gt;&gt;2371398&gt;only /pol/ says niggerHow fucking new are you?
&gt;&gt;2371634&gt;it&#039;s his fault for not writing down the passYes it absolutely is.
&gt;&gt;2373066why the fuck did he transfer all his bitcoins to make his video in the first place though? why did he need to do that? just to show off his 3BTC?
&gt;&gt;2371365&gt; be ugly negro&gt; try to mess with white mans technology&gt; fuck it up and lose a bunch of money&gt; chimp out and demand gibs from the white mannothing to see here just standard negro behaviour
When a nigger cons people, he&#039;s a dirty low life nigger shit. When /pol/ shills do it it&#039;s glorious white conquest.
&gt;&gt;2373364&gt;black people always make it about race...&gt;anonymous image boards do the same thing.fuck this.just gonna have to rape me a few underage blondies.that&#039;ll make me feel better
I want /pol/ to stay in /pol/

&gt;&gt;2373649&gt;&gt;&gt;r/edditYou first you dumb nigger
&gt;&gt;2373649Nah, I&#039;m /biz/ nigger. I just happen to agree with /pol/ that niggers are subhuman. Lived just north of Detroit for awhile near Dearborn. You&#039;ve just clearly never have had to live near mudslimes or niggers.You&#039;re probably in some sheltered mostly white northeastern state.
&gt;&gt;2373673you&#039;re nothing but a racist
&gt;&gt;2371365&gt;He starts chimping out at 7:55
&gt;&gt;2373673Live in DC as an ethnically Norwegian man
&gt;&gt;2373677Racism is simply the acknowledgement of biological differences between subgroups.
&gt;&gt;2373677the truth is &quot;racist&quot;reality is &quot;racist&quot;you&#039;re just willfully ignorant
&gt;&gt;2373677No shit.
&gt;&gt;2371365why are negros even allowed to use white technology?we need online segregation ASAP why can these &quot;people&quot; defile the same bits and bytes that I use
&gt;&gt;2373732&gt;&gt;2373714no if reality was racist then /his/ and /sci/ would be racist. But they&#039;re not
&gt;&gt;2373739&gt; implying science hasnt been completely politicized and kiked over in the last 100 yearskys faggot
&gt;&gt;2373739
&gt;&gt;23713825* postEveryone who replied to it seriously needs to go back to The_Donald aka /pol/
&gt;&gt;2373749&gt;science is wrongsorry but science is right, and you&#039;re wrong
A real nigga aint concerned about making it all for all niggas. A real nigga knows there can only be 1 god.Let white people be &quot;civil&quot;.Let them breed commodity.
&gt;&gt;2373763&gt;making a &quot;THIS&quot; postSounds like your the one who should head back to normiebook and leddit.
&gt;&gt;2373739If reality wasn&#039;t racist then the longitudinal nlbr studies would not show a significant IQ disparity between subgroups. The best predictor for success and breaking out of lower income groups is IQ and when you look at the same IQ groupings people have the same chance of breaking out of lower economic classes despite race. This is why Asians can start so poor and within generations are upper middle class while blacks end up subsisting in ghettos.
&gt;&gt;2373772Yeah, science is right (pic related)
&gt;&gt;2373677being racist is nothing more and nothing less than being realist.i dont hate niggers.in fact i believe that every nigger should live a fulfilled, descent life amongst his fellow niggers.i just dont want them in my country, because they dont belong to europe.
&gt;&gt;2373795I have no pity for that guy on the left, if he had acted as a man should to start with then he would not be in this situation.
you sad sad fucks. quite interesting how low life rednecks are enjoying their anonymity online while their fucking president is screwing them over tenfold and they are still blaming everyone else around them for their fucking life. grow up you antisocial fucktards. instead of opening your fucking eyes you are following an idiot in the white house with the loyalty of a fucking dog about to be shot behind a barn. you should all together be put in a fucking cave.
&gt;&gt;2373772talk to some neuro scientists (in private) and ask them about iq distribution between gender and racesask them why they would never publicly even cite certain studiesedumucate yourself on boasian anthropologyand - finally - kys you ignorant faggot
&gt;&gt;2373826&gt;butthurt europoor mad that he wasn&#039;t born in America so he slams it at every opportunityKek, I swear, this never gets old. Being born part of the greatest empire in the world literally makes me superior to you.Btw, I voted for Trump. I don&#039;t give a fuck if he causes WWIII. I just like seeing normies like you upset.
&gt;&gt;2373826&gt;Trump&#039;s fucking you overNot really, he&#039;s working on reducing my tax rate which will be quite helpful to me.&gt;That only helps the richIt helps upper middle class as well. Really anyone even in the 25% tax bracket comes out well ahead.
&gt;&gt;2373848&gt;giving a shit about a puppetpleb
&gt;&gt;2373841/pol/ scientists don&#039;t countLook at the subhuman IQ average in europeEven whites aren&#039;t 100 average.&gt;&gt;2373784&gt;muh IQThat&#039;s literally all you have.And the IQ studies are basically the judging of IQ of people according to what they do for work or something.You think blacks were sat down on a table with an IQ test and pencil? No they weren&#039;t.Average IQ is a meme.
&gt;&gt;2373869&gt;And the IQ studies are basically the judging of IQ of people according to what they do for work or something.No they are not, you seem utterly unfamiliar with this line of research.&gt;You think blacks were sat down on a table with an IQ test and pencil?They in fact were.
&gt;&gt;2373826&gt;burger too low iq to appreciate posters on an anonymous vietnamese board aren&#039;t necessarily low iq burgersLike pottery.
&gt;&gt;2373869because the &quot;white&quot; european countries have 10-20% shitskins now, dragging down the average iq you fucking retardgo ask any legitimate neuro scientist in private you moron. they wont even talk about certain studies in public because they would get slaughtered from PC sheeple like you.
&gt;&gt;2373869Higher crime rates and lower average IQ are just a coincidence, nothing to see here.
&gt;&gt;2373851&gt;being this shallow minded
&gt;&gt;2373869Also what&#039;s that pic supposed to show? That there is IQ disparities between different subgroups of Europeans? Is that supposed to come as a surprise.
&gt;&gt;2373867Another europoor. Yawn. I literally feel your inferiority permeating through my monitor.
&gt;&gt;2373908&gt;caring about anything other than profit
sub-humans like negros should not be allowed to hold crypto
&gt;&gt;2373848&gt;greatest empire in the worldyou made my day anon. history is def. not your strong suit (or IQ in that matter). I didn&#039;t expect anything less than you voting for trump.
That was more niggery than I expected.
&gt;&gt;2374022No one gives a fuck about what great empires used to exit before America. America is the greatest today and that&#039;s all that matters.
&gt;&gt;2371382&gt;nbomb
&gt;&gt;2374022Odds are we have a military base in your country; therefore, your opinion (and that&#039;s all it is, honestly) is completely invalidated and irrelevant.Every other nation is a dwarf compared to America. Our &quot;greatest threat&quot; is a ragtag group of mudslimes and apparently Russia who has a smaller GDP than Texas.But, please, go on. Pretend you&#039;re relevant.
What kind of restriction could be put in place to prevent /biz/ from becoming /shill/?
One thread per coin
&gt;&gt;2375877Ban on making threads about coins which are only available on Yobit
&gt;&gt;2375889&gt;&gt;2375894both of these
&gt;&gt;2375877More than 6 threads on the same coin means its complete shit.Even bitbean keeps it to like 3 threads at once.
&gt;&gt;2375894In a way it sifts through the newfags because they lose money quickly
&gt;i want to censor posts i dont like&gt;i want to limit free speech&gt;i want to use 100% subjective definitions such as &quot;shilling&quot; to ban posters i dont likeno thanks.
&gt;&gt;2375877infiltrate the discords, grab their ips, and ban them so they can&#039;t manipulate us anymore.
&gt;&gt;2375877Fuck off, it&#039;s related to crypto/business. Who the fuck are you to decide what coins are allowed to be shilled? Think it would have been a good idea to kill all the Harold ethereum threads you retard???

Nice! Thanks OP (previous OP of other thread)
This is one of the few promising projects being shilled right now, desu.I&#039;ve been holding for the last month and the future looks good from here.
&gt;literally too retarded to make an op post correctlyhow am I supposed to trust such a memecoine? gg op.
&gt;&gt;2373664Lol
&gt;&gt;2373664&gt;&gt;2373802&#039;&#039;Country managers&#039;&#039; are going to do the marketing lol.Who are the &#039;&#039;developers&#039;&#039;?Burger flippers?
&gt;&gt;2374115The developers are there nigger, checkhttp://iodigital.io/management/
Bamp
Anyone?
&gt;&gt;2374216The developers are nigger?
Vergin bros, we need to talk.Wtf the fuck is happening?When will it reach 1$?
Why do people expect the prices to go up on the weekend?Unless it&#039;s BTC or ETH, relax.
today
Most alts are correcting. Don&#039;t look at your portfolio for a few hours minimum. Just a week ago we were sub 100s, now we&#039;re holding solid above 130, the dev is releasing new features like mad, and XVG is on the radar. Wait until it gets added to polo before you sell.
&gt;&gt;2375869Most of my hopes are in this coin, do you think it has the potential to reach 1$ in the long term?
DGB killSTRAT killXVG killARK looking killwhat else?
Its finally complete biz, time to get on the cover of the new york times.Normies are flowing into crypto by the hour,Concept:/biz/ gets in early on the newly minted nigger coin with 148,888 supply, low enough to pump the price to the top of coinmarketcap&#039;s list so that everyone logs into CMC to see pic related angry nigger staring them down everyday.Soon:CNN.com reports on nigger coin within the weekBlack lives matter posting on twitter about nigger coinPres obama recampaigns on the platform of defeating nigger coin.Time to change the world /biz/Its on the decentralized WAVES platform because no exchange will ever list this, therefor we must have a marketplace on here so we can get it to the top of coinmarketcap.CMC said they would list NGR if it showed substantial interest/volumeIf we can bump it up to like 10k% increase, and some volume, we can literally have coinmarketcap say nigger to everyone in the world.Just put EYFFwWnmEEWYoWgBSqAJFtQxgihMBa5ssntxMsWfDy9B into the search on waves. Or search nigger and look for that hex code.Lets do this boys.
&gt;&gt;2376165I&#039;m buying this shit right now I know you will make me Rich biz
How do I buy this? I buy waves first and transfer to waves exchange?&gt;inb4 spoonfeed
&gt;&gt;2376184i want the CNN NGR breaking news report :)
&gt;&gt;23761653P5AtT9GHPMfoJF7Lzx6RQqCWsR41pmZSMGwhere can i get some NGR at?
&gt;&gt;2376202download waves lite client, x-fer btc to your btc address there, then search the hex in the markets tabtheres only 148888 supply, most of it is still locked up for a 20 year release, I sold my 10k I was holding already at 1 sat to start the inital distribution
Fucking Biz this will actually work like literally people will be talking about Nigger coin what have you done..
&gt; ITT: A bunch of neets fall for a racial ponzi schemeNo exchange will ever host this = you can&#039;t sell this shit.
&gt;&gt;2376254you should have airdropped lots more niggers on a bunch of other people first
wake up to normies on tv askinghow many niggers do I need to make it?
&gt;&gt;2376297lol i literally said that, NO exchange will host this, thats why its on waves, its on waves, waves tokens get listed on coinmarketcap, thats the goal :^)&gt;&gt;2376301i airdropped it all
&gt;&gt;2376320shit NGR i didn&#039;t get anyselling at 1sat isn&#039;t really airdropping
&gt;&gt;2376320&gt;&gt;2376206&gt;&gt;2376165Fucking BASED anonyou are going to be a legend
&gt;&gt;2376312&gt;guys i only have 5 niggers will i be rich one day?
&gt;&gt;2376320this won&#039;t even make top 100 though, ever. no one looks at the bottom of the coincap list. this coin will be ignored, like a nigger.
&gt;&gt;2376165Any chance nigger coin could be the next eth or btc? I&#039;m thinking about putting our family&#039;s 5k nest egg into nigger coin and letting it sit for a few years. Would be great to have a nice fund by the time our 7 year old is ready to go to college!
&gt;There exists a universe where Hillary won and NGR is a global currency
&gt;&gt;2376358Have I got some news for you my good manI will trade you this here watermellon for 2 more
&gt;&gt;2376337i sold it to a bunch of guys in every single slack channel i know of, guys that trade alot so they can spread the word. its already trading like a legit market on waves right now.&gt;&gt;2376366Everyone filters for %change and price, it will work my dude.&gt;&gt;2376368NGR&gt;ETH and BTC
Would be nice at work to tell them I bought some niggers.Working at company with the ex ceo of ETH, wonder if he can appreciate
Yup.&gt;&gt;2376366Falling for the bait. Another Pump and dump.
make the logo a pacman style klan hood
&gt;&gt;2376368&gt;tfw niggers paid my way through schoolit&#039;s nice to receive welfare for a change
&gt;&gt;2376395Lol, everything is a pump and dump lately, have you looked at every coin on bittrex, this is supposed to be a pump, we want visibility on coinmarketcap, to get listed on coinmarket cap we need volume.
&gt;&gt;2376385&gt;slack channel&gt;not airdropping on bizyou are confirmed for the niggerest
&gt;&gt;2376165My senpai used to own niggers but abe Lincoln made us give them away
&gt;&gt;2376421i didnt want to start off selling shit to biz for profit.Instead i sold it all to some redditors :^)
Hi, I&#039;m the 5-10% daily profits guy. Today I&#039;m at -5,73%
What are you in?
&gt;&gt;23755195% daily profit on 1k and in 365 days you&#039;ll be as big as amazon.
&gt;&gt;2375557Any advice? Just hold?
&gt;&gt;2375571yes, but how realistic is making 5% a day, everyday, for a full year?
me 2 :(
&gt;&gt;2375571You can&#039;t expect him to do basic arithmetic when he can&#039;t tell the difference between a comma and a decimal point.
&gt;&gt;2375653&gt;tfw xdn just slips lower and lower
&gt;&gt;2376016In europoorland we use commas instead of decimal points, you uneducated cunt.&gt;mfw -8,18% now
&gt;&gt;2376063Gee, I didn&#039;t know that. Thanks so much for educating me. I feel so enlightened. Fact is, you still can&#039;t do math for shit. I guess it is because your education system spends all of its resources teaching you to put commas where decimal points belong.
&gt;&gt;2375653why do you only have shitcoins?
&gt;&gt;2376149No problem americunt. I see that your brain is malfunctioning, you should come to europoorland and try one of our free healthcare systems
&gt;&gt;2376161&gt;free
Pretty brutal day today. Things haven&#039;t really recovered since last Monday it doesn&#039;t seem like
&gt;&gt;2375653&gt;LSK&gt;BTCDsomeone&#039;s being copying my portfolio
&gt;&gt;2376149Litteraly everything in crypto is math and every decent crypto project is europe/russia (that&#039;s europe, let&#039;s not kid ourselves) based. Thank you for giving us your money though burger.
&gt;tfw the more time I spend here , the more I hold, and the more I read about crypto news, the less faith I have in all of thismaybe this was a mistakeI should just cash out
Release your bags to us
&gt;&gt;2374893Nah crypto is the future, even Bill Gates said so himself. If you long term hold though stop coming to /biz/ as all these moon and shill threads will make it harder for you to keep money in slow coins.
&gt;&gt;2374893How much money have you made?
If you were to cash out right now, how much profit would you have made in total?
&gt;&gt;23749290I&#039;m at 100% of my original valueit&#039;s been a month thoughbut I just can&#039;t break outevery success story here seems like it&#039;s made upI don&#039;t get it
&gt;&gt;2374893do it faggot
what are you talking about? Go watch Andreas Antonopolous , Max Keiser, etc. your faith will be renewed. This is the biggest technological breakthrough in decades and will literally change the fate of humanity.
&gt;&gt;2374947Does this look made up to you faggot?
&gt;&gt;2374947stop gambling on shitcoins
&gt;&gt;2374947What do you own?
&gt;&gt;2374947what exactly are you doing? trading shillcoins?
&gt;&gt;2374947The market cap of crypto has tripled in just the past couple months, how is it possible to not make profit?
&gt;&gt;2374995btc eth ark waves strats sc lisk
&gt;&gt;2375016buy more ark ;)
&gt;&gt;2374991&gt;&gt;2375001&gt;&gt;2375009everytime I make some profit I try to jump onto the next big thing, and it turns out to be just another p&amp;d shit that makes me lose all my profit and sets me back to zero
&gt;&gt;2374947In the time you&#039;ve been trading ETH went from $88 to $316.&gt;A-all success stories are made up.
&gt;&gt;2375016how are you even losing money while holding btc and eth?the other shitcoins must be really bleeding your gains
&gt;&gt;2375016If you have those how can you not be up?
&gt;&gt;2374893&gt;&gt;2374947OP, there are a couple of things you could be doing which may affect your ability to make gains.1. Are you trading?2. Are you listening to biz&#039;s terrible coin choices?3. Are you pulling out into fiat every time a coin rises?I started a little earlier than you, a month and a half ago, I did my own research and its been easy money.I put 10%-20% into&gt;STRAT&gt;BTC&gt;ETH&gt;ETC&gt;WAVESIf you look from back then I am a pretty happy guy. I didn&#039;t even start with much, but it&#039;s grown to a few thousand when I started at 500.I think that those still have potential to keep rising, especially STRAT since it&#039;s gone down to a great price now for buying.Just go into STRAT and hold and you&#039;ll be pretty happy. You should diversify though.
&gt;&gt;2375051&gt;&gt;2375046I DONT KNOWRELEASE ME FROM THIS PAINI SHOULD JUST STOP BUYING ANY NEW HYPED UP SHIT COIN
&gt;&gt;2374947&gt;Stumble upon /biz/&gt;People yabbering about moon missions&gt;Buy ETH&gt;Months later i made profit out of forgetting i even had itThat&#039;s the story of how i made over 100% profit in a span of months, all you had to do was play the brainlet you really are but you&#039;re even beneath that somehow
&gt;&gt;2375068clearly m8. get your wallets safe and walk away for a while.
&gt;&gt;2375040This makes complete sense. You are listening to biz shit and you are also trading.Trading = raped by fees, not able to take advantage of anything because you&#039;re not in anything.Just diversify and hold. Suddenly in a week your money is in on the action and you won&#039;t want to sell ever.
&gt;&gt;2375068Fucker you don&#039;t need to stop buying these shit coins.Do what I do. I have my primary portfolio in my top picks, about 70%-80%, then I split 2%-5% for shitcoins or coins that are getting hyped up.Example - I put 2%-5% alts when they first appear here like RDD, ARK, BITBAY, Bitbean, POSW, MOON.Usually when I lose, I lose 1-3% of my portfolio, don&#039;t care.When I gain, I get back a lot. Much more than i&#039;ve lost.You can play, just do it on the side of your long term holds.
&gt;&gt;2374919&gt;Bill GatesI have some bad news for you
&gt;&gt;2375068&gt;I SHOULD JUST STOP BUYING ANY NEW HYPED UP SHIT COINand you wonder why you haven&#039;t made money?Nigger I started like 2 and half weeks ago and I&#039;ve already made 50% ROI through ETH alone.The only shitcoin I have is RDD and that&#039;s because they are actually targeting a specific market and it&#039;s cheap
&gt;&gt;2374987you can input any random numbers into blockfolio, not like its synced to real accounts lol, so yes it does
Stop buying shit immediately after it increased 500%
&gt;&gt;2374947How the fuck have you not made a profit in this market?You really shouldn&#039;t be fucking trading if you can&#039;t at least eke out small gains in this massive bull market.
&gt;&gt;2374893&gt;Bought ETH 2 months ago&gt;Up $2000Just hold man, don&#039;t day or weektrade.
&gt;&gt;2374893stop gambling shitcoins and just start investing in ETH and BTC. Only invested in those (and LTC on accident) and I&#039;m at almost $200 profit after 2 days. Keep holding fag.
&gt;&gt;2375416&gt;tfw need to invest thousands just to make a profit of $100I invested a couple hundred into BTC, ETH and some shitcoins, and while I have made a profit, it&#039;s only been like $5 so far, which covered the transaction fees, so I&#039;m really not ahead anythingIs it even worth it if you don&#039;t have a lot to invest?
&gt;&gt;2374947Are you kidding me.... Were in a bull market literally everything is going up stop daytrading
&gt;&gt;2374976&gt;Go watch Andreas Antonopolous , Max Keiser, etc. your faith will be renewed. This is the biggest technological breakthrough in decades and will literally change the fate of humanitycan you recommend some specific videos to show normies to convince them that this is a legit thing? (aka to convince my mom to keep letting me squat in her shed)
&gt;&gt;2374893/biz/ is mostly just a bunch of nocoiner trolls.
&gt;&gt;2375208A fellow BitBay holder I see. True patrician
&gt;&gt;2375464Andreas Antonopolous on Joe Rogan was pretty good.
So listen guys, I&#039;ve invested all my money into STRAT, XVG, SC and DGB. I&#039;m obviously getting raped right now, but of course I&#039;m hodling with iron hands.However I&#039;m wondering if it will ever pay off. Even IF all these coins recover, maybe even moon, wouldn&#039;t I make more money by just putting everything in BTC and ETH? Even now, at a loss?Holding altcoins seems like a meme where everyone is gambling to catch the next ETH, although there never might be another ETH.
&gt;&gt;2376151Why not buy ETH? We are in the middle of ETH&#039;s moon voyage. There is still time anon.
all those stuff is going up in the long term you faggotlook at the 1w chart and not at 1min chartforget about your coins, delete blockfolio and get out of your mother&#039;s basement for a while, when you come back go claim your lambo
&gt;&gt;2376209Yeah they might go up, but what I&#039;m asking is if they will gain me more than ETH and BTC. Which I seriously doubt right now.
If you are looking for a &#039;get trillionaire overnight&#039; way then go suck dicks for cashIn a bullish market like this stuff is only going up
&gt;&gt;2376151Those are all meme shitcoinsJesus dude, get some eth and btc and just hodl
Post your absolute best FUD here. For coiners to play devil&#039;s advocate and nocoiners to shitpost.The great majority of coiners are libertarians and Austrian economists of the Ron Paul ilk, and they tend to overvalue and overhype things. Just look at Paul&#039;s presidential campaigns: many supporters actually believed he had the support to become president based on manipulated online polling and just general unwarranted optimism. So much so that while his support was very low, he received the highest number of individual donations. Investments that ended up a mistake. They get caught up in movements that are simply lost causes and doomed to fail. Bitcoin and Ethereum each have hurdles to clear that may or may not end in failure. Non-libertarians may simply never become interested in crypto because they aren&#039;t drawn to it for whatever reason. Normies gonna norm.
Just hit $300 on coinbase

SO GLAD I USED HALF MY HOLDINGS TO BUY ZEN LAST WEEK
&gt;&gt;2374202Fuck.
&gt;&gt;2374129WOOOOOOOAAAAHW
all these dudes sold last night trying to short eth
&gt;&gt;2374183I&#039;m in the same boat. I also had to pass on my plan to invest in ETH when it was at $10 because I couldn&#039;t obtain a stable job and work permit for almost a year. Had to survive on my remaining funds for visa runs/food/rent. I hate gooks with all of my heart. I&#039;m fucking livid.

&gt;314$
&gt;&gt;2374129Can we expect ETH to hit $600 this year?
THISISSPARTA!!!!!!!!!
&gt;&gt;2374198Because not all of us are as shitty as you at trading.
&gt;&gt;2374301&gt;Can we expect ETH to hit $600 this year?probably next week
&gt;&gt;2374301christ who knows anymore. could hit $1000 if raiden and metropolis actually work
Ya think it will drop to 270-280 in the next few days? Don&#039;t wanna jump in it at 300!
&gt;&gt;2374197Me too, exactly! I could of had 1300 of these babies at $11, but I was too unsure. Oh well, I still have a lot, relatively speaking :).
&gt;&gt;2374129ETH NO
&gt;&gt;2374129what do you guys use to trade? I am only on coinbase right now.
*gasp*
&gt;&gt;2374320300 is the new bottom
&gt;&gt;2374320I read the same thing yesterday when it was at $ 260
&gt;&gt;2374353coinbase for fiat -&gt; ETHpolo for GNT &lt;-&gt; ETHkraken for ICN &lt;-&gt; ETH
&gt;&gt;2374336Oh fuck off. It can go up $200 in a day and drop $10 and you&#039;ll start shitting your pants. Weak hands.
&gt;&gt;2374320Just buy, anon. You could play your game forever, and never get in.
just bought the tiny bitgod i love sell walls
defending disco dancing
&gt;&gt;2374395*tiny dip
&gt;&gt;2374320&gt;&gt;2374389Don&#039;t buy while it&#039;s still going up. At least wait for it to stabilize a bit. There&#039;s gonna be a dip but no idea how low it would go
Guys, I really am getting scared with how eth is performing. I haven&#039;s seen a single dapp running, they don&#039;t have a lightweight local wallet and many people don&#039;t know how to program contracts. Hell I think 90% of hodlers just keep it on the exchanges.This defies the golden advice - be fearful when others are greedy.
&gt;&gt;2374464Don&#039;t scare me.
&gt;&gt;2374464This is what&#039;s stopping me from going in right now. FOMO is real but this rise is insane.
&gt;&gt;2374464&gt;WAITING FOR THE DIP
When do I buy more?
&gt;&gt;2374464lol the technology behind any coin doesnt mean shit.you buy for the speculation
&gt;still a no coiner&gt;friends who bought in ETH at $100 now bragging about their gains&gt;too scared to buy in because they tell me its high risk high reward&gt;meanwhile im missing out on free moneyFuck should I just buy now? I&#039;m scared of the risk but it looks safe because this shit hasn&#039;t dropped at all yet.
&gt;&gt;2374550Buy you fucking tard

&gt;&gt;237454410 minutes ago.
&gt;&gt;2374464where would I learn about all that weird stuff you said?
&gt;&gt;2374558what are you using for charting?
&gt;&gt;2374566on the internet, you lazy asshole
GIVE THEM NOTHINGBUT TAKE FROM THEM EVERYTHING
I reckon it will reach 325$ then dip and go sideaways before the conference in China were there a new ATH
How are those 50k gains, anon?
the flippening
&gt;&gt;2374464Doesn&#039;t bother me. ETH is still lower than the market cap of BTC when it can do everything BTC can but better and without the civil war.
&gt;&gt;2374576he&#039;s using cryptowat.ch
&gt;&gt;2374603cannot LOL too much at this
&gt;&gt;2374464Just look at what it already is compared to Bitcoin though. After it gets past Bitcoin&#039;s market cap I might start to get a little worried
LIVE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshWhCNtqkMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshWhCNtqkMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshWhCNtqkM
should I risk everything and just open a degenerately big margin long on ETH/USD? I would close after 10$ increase.
&gt;&gt;2374667I don&#039;t have the balls
TY BASED VITALIK
if ethereum hits 1000$ i will build a hostel in gibraltar
&gt;&gt;2374721If ETH hits $1000 i will pay this dude to be my sex toy
&gt;&gt;2374581yeah, but is there a Top Ten Crypto Trading Tips video or something I can watch in two or even three minutes so I can become a multimillionaire? I don&#039;t want to spend hours reading boring stuff that I can&#039;t even understand. I&#039;d even settle for a &#039;how to&#039; wiki or infographic if it doesn&#039;t have too many words.
&gt;&gt;2374667i see a local peak at 317.80 or so and then dip to 292
&gt;&gt;2374667yeah i wanna see that do it
&gt;&gt;2374721&gt;/biz/ mansion
&gt;&gt;2374283This. If Americans dump right now, we can fuck over some chinks!
&gt;&gt;2374640thanks. have a picture of my gf.
There is no way it can keep climbing without a dip. Looking dangerous
&gt;&gt;2374197Motherfucker you turned 2.5k into a down payment on a half million dollar home. Be stoked
&gt;&gt;2374823&gt;&gt;2374760&gt;&gt;2374592&gt;&gt;2374533&gt;&gt;2374414
&gt;&gt;2374823That&#039;s what I said last night. I though 0.104 must be the high... cost me 2BTC to get out of that short.Moral of the story? Crypto is impossible to predict.
&gt;&gt;2374667I wouldn&#039;t do that right now.
Holy shit what happened to the brakes on this ride??
&gt;&gt;2374756my jimmies are rustled&gt;i can&#039;t be bothered to spend any time learning
&gt;&gt;2374793fuck there it goes. 303 to 313. could had been big.
dude coinbase sucks for Australians, can only but not sell
It is going to dip soon back to 300$ or less, no way it can keep going that high
&gt;&gt;2374902don&#039;t underestimate itbut yeah $300 is the new floor, I doubt we&#039;ll see it below $290 ever again
&gt;&gt;2374902it will be $400 by the end of the day
&gt;&gt;2374823I just sold .5, bought in @ 90Its flying sky highShould i buy more LTC? Its steady around 29-30Thinking og dumpink like 5k usd into BTC in august
&gt;&gt;2374895&gt;Selling your eth&gt;everI hope you faggots don&#039;t do this
&gt;&gt;2374936only got like 0.72 so not like im making any real money
&gt;&gt;2374823Look at the historyThis happened several times already, climbing very high and then never dipping for more than $10 before the next climb
&gt;&gt;2374902&gt;no way it can keep going that high
&gt;&gt;2374902no-coiners truly are pathetic

I&#039;m getting out of LTC and XRP (finally) and putting that into ETH.I refuse to keep holding these boring lifeless bags while watching ETH climb day after goddamn day.
&gt;&gt;2374983close it now while you still can.350$ inc.
&gt;&gt;2374983you do not short something in a super uptrend like thisare you insanefucking shorting ETH is literally the only thing worse than being a nocoinerclose your position and go long NOWand APOLOGIZE
&gt;&gt;2374983&gt;&gt;2374558your expectations are too high, should have bought on the first bounce
&gt;&gt;2374983condolences, just hit a new high
&gt;&gt;2375000bad decision. theres nothing wrong with having a stake in ripple, xem, augur and golem. not sure about litecoin
Can&#039;t eth drop so I can buy the dip?
holy crap, I just read up about SAR parabolics and it seems this is a huge bull run. I have no idea when it will stop climbing
&gt;&gt;2374902&gt;I..IT CAN&#039;T KEEP GOING UP&gt;says nervous nocoiner for the millionth time this year
this feels like a dream
&gt;&gt;2375041YOU EITHER HAVE ETH OR YOU DONTSEE&gt;&gt;2374842
&gt;&gt;2375033I&#039;m long on both LTC and XRP long-term, but I can get back into them Thursday when my next paycheck comes. If one moons before then, so be it. By that point ETH will probably be $350.
&gt;&gt;2375058Don&#039;t buy at the ALL TIME HIGHDON&#039;TDON&#039;T
&gt;&gt;2375064i understand. good luck
PLEASE HELP: Trying to set up any sort of account to buy Ethereum.Been trying to sign up for Coinbase and GDAX all day, but the website crashed on me while I was verifying my ID and now it tells me I have to wait 24 hours to re-try. With ETH booming to the fucking moon, I fear I don&#039;t have time or money to wait 24 more hours before purchasing (it&#039;s my first time).Are there any alternative ways for me to buy ETH? Any alternative, good sites? Even just temporary solutions, until I an finish my sign-up for Coinbase and move everything back over there, would be fine.I&#039;m desperate here, please help.
&gt;&gt;2375067&gt;mfw they don&#039;t buy&gt;mfw ETH grows another 50% this weekend
&gt;&gt;2375067SHUT THE FUCK UPBUY RIGHT NOWHAVE A STOP LOSS IN CASE THINGS TURN SOUTHITS FUCKING TRADING 101WE ARE RUNNING UP WITH NO SIGNS OF STOPPING
&gt;&gt;2375067nigga there is an ath literally every week, why do you want people to lose money?
&gt;&gt;2375081livecoin is a shitty exchange but you should be able to get today.
&gt;DONT BUY ETH! ITS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH! YOULL LOSE MONEY FOR SURE&gt;t. no coiners when ETH was 30 dollars.
&gt;&gt;2375081I was in the same boat as you waiting for kraken verification (and still am), here&#039;s what I did.&gt;find local bitcoin atm&gt;buy BTC, convert to ETH using shapeshifthope this helps while we both wait for verification.
&gt;&gt;2374183What happened? I created an account last night and made a purchase via credit card. The only problem was confirming the purchase with my credit company because it was instantly flagged for potentially fraudulent. Otherwise it worked perfectly. I just linked my bank account too.
the really early guys with 1000+ eth have long quit this board and cashed out, right. what we have here are the losers who bought too late or had too little and still have to wait for the million.
&gt;&gt;2375107Is it relatively safe? Can I transfer my holdings from livecoin to coinbase/GDAX later on?
&gt;&gt;2375081You&#039;re experiencing FOMO&gt;I fear I don&#039;t have time or money to wait 24 more hours before purchasingYou&#039;re wrong. Today&#039;s gain isn&#039;t the first and it won&#039;t be the last. Get in the right way using a legitimate exchange instead of some quick bullshit method where you take a haircut right away like localbitcoins.
Holy $300 was 4D reverse Bear trap. What is this don&#039;t even.....
&gt;&gt;2375112&gt;find local bitcoin atmLmao, where the fuck did you dig up such a thing? There&#039;s absolutely zero chance of me being able to do that.
&gt;&gt;2374822Plain jane.
&gt;&gt;2375139How should anyone know where you live, bucko?
&gt;&gt;2375132probably a bunch of limit orders triggered.
&gt;&gt;2374844How could you short in this market? I&#039;m glad i learned my lesson not short margin on polo. My lesson only cost 0.3 BTC.
&gt;&gt;2375127thisdont rushdont do this&gt;&gt;2368011because youll be forced to hold the ETH for a week and who knows what will happen in the meantimedo this instead&gt;&gt;2367525set up an account, transfer funds, study the charts, find a proper entry, dont be emotional.
&gt;&gt;2375139https://coinatmradar.com/I am only trying to help here.
Metropolis and Raiden coming soon.Not buying now.How fucking dumb are you people?I will put 10k more to this monday
&gt;&gt;2375125safe? sure man. just set up 2fa and use a proper password. yeah, i used livecoin for some shitcoin a while black then transferred to gdax.
&gt;&gt;2375122I bought at $11, bitch.Cope harder.

Historical, ETH drops 15/20% aftwr each surge. Not sure if it will this time but it did when it went to $60/$100/$150/$200/$250
WHERE IS THE DIP YOU ASSHOLES YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE A DIP
&gt;&gt;2375162I&#039;m not expecting them to, I&#039;m just saying there is no chance there exists such an ATM here. That option is off limits to me
&gt;&gt;2375084can I stop loss on coinbase??
&gt;&gt;2375213no.&gt;&gt;2375210those faggots scammed us.It&#039;s going to 350 and we&#039;re losing money
&gt;&gt;2375213on GDAX yes, on coinbase regular no
&gt;&gt;2375210It will dip anon. . .right guys?
&gt;&gt;2374129Thread theme https://youtu.be/fapPNHcxhDY
&gt;&gt;2375228&gt;&gt;2375213you can always have a &#039;mental&#039; stop loss though, where [if it reaches X price I will manually smash that fuckin sell button]
&gt;&gt;2374129FUCKING DIP ETH
&gt;&gt;2374983GET OUT
&gt;&gt;2375229&gt;&gt;2375248lets hang outselves now
Alright boys and gals I wanna see some truly honest accounts here. None of this $500m Blockfolio bullshit
Nothing too fancy but feelsgoodman
&gt;&gt;2374813I like it. How long have you been in the game Anon?
&gt;&gt;2374836Roughly two months now. I&#039;ve known about bitcoin since around 2010 but only recently managed to get my hands on enough money to invest. I started with roughly 8k
&gt;&gt;2374813&gt;ETH , GNT , ANT , AUGprime holds
&gt;&gt;2374859Same expect I finally managed to get my account verified this morning because I&#039;m overseas in Japan. I immediately dumped $2,700 into coins and I&#039;m glad I did because I&#039;m gonna hold on for the long run
Sold 100k Verge at 240 SAT high.... Been hodling since 7 SATS.
What should I get next?
95% OF EARTH&#039;S POPULATION CANNOT THINK BY YOURSELF AND DO SAME LIKE NEARHOODS
&gt;&gt;2376351i thought this was a digibyte shill thread for a momentfuck digishit and it&#039;s fucking shittibank threads I see them in my fucking sleepthank fuck I ain&#039;t bagholding this garbage
&gt;100% of OP can&#039;t grammar good
&gt;&gt;2376373I think this is a paid poojet shill and his caps lock is broken
&gt;&gt;2376351Based Nguyen
The worst thing about days like these when almost everything is crashing is that I want to start moving coins around in order to make some profit that stops the losses, but making those movements only worsen the situation.
&gt;Buy coin for 2k$&gt;Goes down 20%End me senpaitians.
get a hobby. distract yourself with building robots and do science experiments
&gt;&gt;2376354lmao that picture is fantastic.
&gt; Daddy why are we poorfags and Uncle John drives a Lambo?Well Steph, he invested in ReddCoin and I didn&#039;t. I thought that was a waste of time and fake online money which no one would ever use.&gt; L-like people thought of BTC Daddy?Yes, yes Steph like BTC. I decided that working for near minimum wage was better for you until I broke my leg and got fired.Now you have to suck dick so we can pay the bills. How is that online stripping coming along?&gt; It&#039;s funny daddy because I get a lot of Tips from Reddcoin. Oh daddy, why didn&#039;t you listen to uncle John?/biz/... Don&#039;t be like Stepth&#039;s father and buy before its too late. Thank me later.
&gt;&gt;2374184No one wants your bags stupid faggot
&gt;&gt;23741892500% gainz, wow my bags are so heavy
&gt;&gt;2374189Lol what bags?Got in at 20 sats. Im good
No one is holding bags retardRDD is going to the moon once Redd-ID is outenjoy those digibags
&gt;&gt;2374184RDD is almost ready for take off.Redd-ID coming out.Android walletAnd dome othdr stuff om the works.The dev also said that Reddcoin is getting a lot of attention amd not only from reddcoin holders but from outside groups too.This is going to be big.
This coin was able to shoot up in value with just a bit of generated interest. Once the next update comes out it will have a similar increase in price.This is a ground-floor chance to be a part of something big. Yuge even.
RDD is one of my main investments and should be everyones!
&gt;&gt;2374908And no marketing.Hopefully they get a team together to promote this when the time is ready.
&gt;&gt;2376357They have literally no marketing, no hype, nothing and it&#039;s still at 100 satsfucking potential in this coin is crazy
That&#039;s ok I&#039;ll happily buy at 120 instead of 100 if it does actually moon
How do we get rid of this fucking bot keeping the price down?
Cant only strong hands win
&gt;&gt;2370426why would you drive up the priceim still accumulating
Pls no, I haven&#039;t fully bought in yet.
we profit from it and also get cheap ARK before he removes the sellwalls and we moon ?????he is doing us a favor..
&gt;&gt;2370438shill. post pics or stfu
&gt;&gt;2370426Sell faggot, you lost already
i only put it $75 at 60 cents, fuckin wish i put more, got a lot more now but not at that price point....heh
I&#039;m holding Ark and I&#039;m starting to doubt my own sanity. Why the fuck is everyone claiming it&#039;s a PND or scam? Do they just want to get people to panic sell?
&gt;&gt;2370826&gt;tfw bought 10,000 at $.40
&gt;&gt;2370810I think I&#039;m doing okay, cocksucker
&gt;&gt;2370858you iron handing it son?
&gt;&gt;2371035Yupp. This is easily a $10+ coin so I won&#039;t sell until then, minimum.
&gt;&gt;2370426but this is what anarcho-capitalism looks like; either deal with it or go buy some ETH
&gt;&gt;2371091very nice. i can def see this coin going places, it&#039;s got a hell of a lot more going for it than 99% of these other fuckin coins
&gt;&gt;2371122Agreed. Less than 3 months old, good tech/code, innovative ideas, solid devs, sleek website, cool name and logoIt&#039;s a diamond in the rough imo.
How much you guys holding?
&gt;&gt;2371213more
&gt;&gt;2371213750 and voted for bizas soon as I start seeing a change in the trend I&#039;ll double that
&gt;&gt;2371213about 560
&gt;&gt;2371213around 200. was going to buy another 1000 but started to have doubts desu
3850 Anon.I want to take out 1000 if this and diversify.The whale is winning I guess.Looking at the chart from the last year something similar happened. Was a bot left on for a whole 6 weeks from the last pump? Anyway.. HODL ME TIGHT
&gt;&gt;2370426for it to be $10 dollars each it will need to have a $1b market cap, this is easily possible but why do you think it will happen in a week, we new this from the start. everyone just chill the fuck out go about your day in 6 months come back
Been watching the price all night.FUCK YOU, WHARU!
&gt;&gt;2371279This. It&#039;s still up like 300% in a week, and the coin is barely 2 and a half months old.Get in a staking pool, go play some video games or something and just forget about it for a couple months. ETH was sub-$10 for over a year before going supernova.
&gt;&gt;2370426I think this is great, actually. You can use the bot too to make gains and accumulate Ark, then just Hodl.
&gt;&gt;2372327Okay I might be stupid as fuck, but why have I not been doing this all along?
&gt;&gt;2372354Because you don&#039;t know when the whale will let it moon, and the longer he keeps it up, the more likely he&#039;ll be done accumulating by the time you start day trading.This is why I won&#039;t, but you can certainly make profit if you&#039;re more ballsy than me.
&gt;&gt;2370426&gt;&gt;2372440&gt;&gt;2372354Why would someone set a bot up too keep the price low and lose money doing so?Plis explained
&gt;&gt;2372440Honestly, he&#039;s been doing this for so long. Might be a bit late to start now. But I might as well throw my 3k ARKs in. When it jumps to $1,15 I&#039;ll buy back in.&gt;&gt;2373419He wants to buy more cheap coins before the coin&#039;s value inevitably increases.
&gt;&gt;2373419because one you have millions of dollars you find that you want more, so you manipulate the price of coins with potential to keep it artificially low, right, allowing you to accumulate thousands more daily at a low price. When the interest of the product gets enough traction, the whale will be holding hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of assets and can cash in bigly
&gt;&gt;2370426This is getting seriously fucking ridiculous. Pic related.Ive reported the issue to Bittrex. Bot manipulation is against their Terms of Service. I encourage everyone here to do the same.Still waiting on a response from them.
&gt;&gt;2371213
&gt;&gt;2373573Then we get hit with the real twist: Bittrex are using the bots
&gt;&gt;2370845whales are FUDding trying to get cheap ark
&gt;&gt;2371213I believe in ARK
&gt;&gt;23712133000, bought at under .40
&gt;&gt;23712132850
&gt;&gt;23712138.5kwanted 10k but i&#039;d have to sell more ETH for that and i feel i can&#039;t be having that
Balls deep.
&gt;&gt;2373654&gt;&gt;2371213Forgot to hit reply
&gt;&gt;2373654&gt;&gt;2373629We&#039;ll make it.
&gt;&gt;2373694lawdy, you brave motherfuckerhelp me out ark bros, i&#039;m holding:APXTrustcoinUBIQTokenCardStratisDigix DAOGuppyLunyrBlocknetDashNEMMoneroRipplePivxi bought all of these for fomo. should i liquidate any and buy ark instead?
&gt;tfw holding ARK and DGBIt&#039;s been a wild ride these past couple of days.
&gt;&gt;2373718I&#039;m not familiar with some of them, so I&#039;d dump these:APX, Trustcoin, Tokencard, Digix DAO, Guppy, LunyrETH and ARK is what I&#039;m doing.
&gt;&gt;2370845Stop reading /biz/ for awhile. People thought ETH was a scam and they still do, the only difference is Eth was 20 bucks then and it&#039;s 275 now. Price can be whatever in this market, don&#039;t forget fundamentals don&#039;t matter(until they do).
&gt;&gt;2373573Don&#039;t bother anon, another anon already complained and the support admitted they&#039;re letting him do it.I don&#039;t know why people think the price will rise if he gets banned, without his volume it might fall for months until it gets listed on other exchanges.I made 8 Ark last night selling at 38 and leaving an open buy order at 34, not willing to do it again but there you go.
&gt;&gt;2373606This.How do you think they make money? With fucking bots that&#039;s how.
&gt;&gt;2373885is ark only on bittrex?
&gt;&gt;2373888there&#039;s a 0.25% fee for each trade
&gt;&gt;2373885I&#039;m that.I am still trying to come up with a way to beat their stupid pattern. Unfortunately without the large amount of BTC they seem to have, it&#039;ll be hard to compete.
Basically the bot creates artificial buy/sell walls to cause price swings. It then buys and sells on those swings so that it can&#039;t possible lose. It has a shit ton of BTC behind it so there&#039;s only 3 ways to win. Either don&#039;t play (give up and move on to something else), It&#039;s people decide to stop liking easy money, or a friendly whale with more money then them comes in and just buys them out of their shit and destroys all the sell walls for us.
&gt;&gt;2373914&gt;keep prices low&gt;get big fees from large transactions&gt;remove bot&gt;high prices and you got&#039;s the fees
This and ETH are my 2 long-term holds. I&#039;m confident that the price would be higher in the future so I&#039;m not too worried about it. As the project hits more milestones it is bound to hit other exchanges. While the bot is extremely irritating, it&#039;s nothing compared to how much I&#039;d be kicking myself if I sell now.
&gt;&gt;2373694Wew lad. That&#039;s a future millionaires amount right there.
&gt;&gt;2373718Get rid of NEM and Ripple. Theyre not going anywhere any time soon. Make some money with other coins and then buy back into those projects later.
&gt;&gt;2373885If enough people complain and biz raids their support requests, then maybe something can get pushed through.
&gt;&gt;2374210bittrex is well aware of this guy and his bot service. he hangs out in their support IRC. they aren&#039;t going to do shit about it.we&#039;ll never know who the people are the are using the service, but wouldn&#039;t it be fucked if it were the coins admins.what we need is more and larger exchanges so we can have a balance and bring in more funding sources.
&gt;all this FUD&gt;all this FOMO&gt;all this hype&gt;all this buzzi can&#039;t tell who is jewing who anymore
&gt;&gt;2374249The positive side of this is that the coin can&#039;t be hijacked by PnD shills.
&gt;&gt;2374245I don&#039;t see other exchanges happening soon. Poloniex are a bunch of fuckers and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they disappeared tomorrow. Who else can compete with Bittrex&#039;s volume?
QRL QRL QRL QRL QRL QRL DIPPING
&gt;&gt;2374324this makes me want to buy into decentralized exchanges&#039; ICOs
&gt;&gt;2374319&gt;can&#039;t be hijacked by PnD shillsYou mean teenagers and 21-year-olds on Discord can&#039;t manipulate it with their shit-tier buying power. It&#039;s still being manipulated like crazy.
&gt;&gt;2374349like who, WAVES? (((BANCOR)))?
As much as it sucks I don&#039;t think we can really fix it unless someone lurking here has 100btc to break it&#039;s shit withMay as well just ride the waves
&gt;&gt;2374349Decentralized exchanges are far past the ICO stage. They are coming sooner rather than later.
&gt;&gt;2374349&gt;&gt;2374387BlockNet (BLOCK)
&gt;&gt;2374392a collective OY VEY is heard in the distance
&gt;&gt;2374245What if someone here much cooler than I can DDoS attack traderdaddy.com?
&gt;&gt;2374433shits probably running on some kinda cloud service, good luck ddosing amazon
&gt;&gt;2374249ARK is a great project with great fundamentals but seems to attract the shittiest, greediest fucking whales. Thats why you see all the differing viewpoints on this coin.
&gt;&gt;2374387NVO
&gt;&gt;2374408Yeah and its coming from shitty, cheap, backstabbing exchanges like Poloniex and Coinbase.
&gt;&gt;2374465Whales want the biggest slice of the cake and they know Ark will become a very big cake
&gt;&gt;2373913Yep.&gt;&gt;2373942I wouldn&#039;t bother, just sell high buy low, the bot is clearly the majority of the volume. I thought they would push to 40k but now it&#039;s 38k, they are either pushing the price down or trying to make it stable before the moon. I figure we&#039;ll see 34 or less again today, buy in then.&gt;&gt;2374324I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about, bittrex is the small fish here compared to any exchange. The most trusted is kraken, polo is the most popular in the west. Bittrex is popular on /biz/ but they don&#039;t have the volume.
&gt;&gt;2374508I guess I wasn&#039;t thinking about kraken because I don&#039;t see them adding it anytime soon. What exchanges are you thinking of then?
i&#039;m starting to recognize this bot on more and more coins lately. it&#039;s going to be the cancer that kills bittrex
&gt;&gt;2374649desu it made me almost 0,3 BTC by regularly swinging STRAT
&gt;&gt;2374405so sad I didn&#039;t get on BLOCK train while it was around $2
&gt;&gt;2374704what kind of behavior does it do that you can take advantage of?
&gt;&gt;2374849Its still at a steal my friend. Its supply is absurdly low and the product isnt even out yet, nevermind the fact that it doesnt even have a any userbase yet. Just wait till it gets released and it becomes the go to exchange, the price will go to fucking pluto.
&gt;&gt;2374888it made STRAT fluctuate by 30ksats regularly; the floor was obvious by the buy wall, the high likewise
&gt;&gt;2374319of course it can m8. how much is the /biz/ node thing worth now?
&gt;&gt;2374941445558 ARK and risinghttps://www.arknode.net/VoteReport.txt
&gt;&gt;2374905so it fluctuates it up and down like crazy? well i&#039;m seeing the pattern now when i look at the chart.
&gt;&gt;2374972right but it&#039;s tiresome and consumes a lot of your time
&gt;&gt;2374972i&#039;m continuing to write my bot to compete with this shit. at least ride on it&#039;s coattails.
&gt;&gt;2374990Only whales can beat other whales. Your bot will amount to nothing.
&gt;&gt;2370426don&#039;t just buy and hold. ARK is a solid long-term coin
&gt;&gt;2374990what would happen if we all used bots and they all just start competing with each other?
&gt;&gt;2375011not talking about beating, but trading on the swings they create works. i&#039;ve done it by hand. i can detect the walls they setup and undercut/overbid just enough to make a profit each time.
&gt;&gt;2374990you&#039;d always be susceptible to fail any time there&#039;s a change in target bot&#039;s operating parameters
&gt;&gt;2375043I&#039;m currently doing the same. What&#039;s up with that guy? He can&#039;t even pump to 38k sat
He&#039;s killing the coin lmao
&gt;&gt;2375044i&#039;ve been studying the bots patterns for literally 4 days. i can recognize when the bots are active on any coin at a glance now.i&#039;m a software engineer handling big data and statistical analysis professionally.
&gt;&gt;2375130You might be right...
&gt;&gt;2375153I was surprised when he sold at around $1.04. He had another, bigger wall up behind that one. How can I predict that?
&gt;&gt;2375130ooohhh my godim guessing he just takes those sell walls off once he reaches a support line
&gt;&gt;2375189i&#039;m gonna do a full writeup so everyone can recognize the patterns and have an understanding when to buy and sell. if the word spreads to enough coins/people, we might be able to reduce these fuckers profits enough to drive em away.
&gt;&gt;2375220are u gonna make a pastebin
&gt;&gt;2375153If you&#039;re experienced with these bots so much, do you have any idea when he might leave the coin alone? This is becoming extremely frustrating and I refuse to sell off my ARK no matter how long I have to wait. It would be nice to know how long exactly I will have to wait though.
&gt;&gt;2375130Im telling you this bot is going to ruin this coin.Price manipulation with sell walls is fine every once in a while to accumulate some extra cheap coins, but to continue to do it for weeks on end is going to kill any interest in the coin and the only thing youll be accumulating cheaply is empty fucking bags.This is way overkill, proceed with caution biz bros.
&gt;&gt;2375235I was thinking of that, but some of this will be easier to explain visually, so I&#039;m thinking of throwing it up on a webhost
&gt;&gt;2375258this is exactly what will happen. unfortunately the people using the bots don&#039;t give a shit about the coin or the coins companies, it&#039;s simply a BTC siphon. once they&#039;ve sucked the life out of the coins they all attach to, they&#039;ll just move onto the next.
&gt;&gt;2375258Maybe we can message the devs? I reported the bot to Bittrex yesterday but looks like they don&#039;t care.
&gt;&gt;2375220Doing Gods work, anon. Thank you.
&gt;&gt;2375258The coin&#039;s too good for that to happen in my opinion.Just try to profit as long as he&#039;s around. It&#039;s constant profit.
&gt;&gt;2375298I reported it too, and still havent received a response back yet.The only thing I can think of is to attempt somehow to take down traderdaddy.comThere has to be someone here capable of doing it.
&gt;&gt;2375333Are we sure they&#039;re the source behind this whole thing? If they are, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re right in that someone here can bring them down. It&#039;s gonna need it&#039;s own thread I think.
&gt;&gt;2375333bittrex is well aware of this bot and the guy running the website, he hangs out in their support IRC and openly flaunts the bots success. &quot;it&#039;s all apart of the cryptocoin game, gotta figure out how to beat the bots&quot;.what a fucking jokethe bots make bittrex a shit ton of money from the constant buy/sell fees it collects as a result, so of course they aren&#039;t gonna do shit about it.
just aquire cheap ark1$ is a fucking joke
&gt;&gt;2375323Youre talking to someone who had 13,000 ARK at one point since it was at .04 cents who had to dump it at around .20 cents because it stagnated and grew sideways for nearly a month straight while literally every other coon mooned around it. Im glad I did too, because I would have lost out on a lot of money had I continued to hold.Im am not someone who is known for having weak hands.I do believe ARK is a great project, but if you think that in the ADHD world of crypto where people are becoming millionaires over night that investors are just going to hold thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of a stagnating, artificially manipulated coin while everything else continues to grow around it, well, no, its just not gonna happen. People will drop it like a bad habit and move on to something else that grows.Sucks, but thats the way it is in crypto.
&gt;&gt;2375400What can we reach once whales let us moon?
&gt;&gt;2375449I&#039;m thinking $5-10 at first, later on even higher
&gt;&gt;23754495-10$ this year isnt far off i think
&gt;&gt;2375245Seconded.
&gt;&gt;2375386&gt;&quot;it&#039;s all apart of the cryptocoin game, gotta figure out how to beat the bots&quot;.We have to either find a way to either doxx this faggot or ddos attack the source of his bot (possibly traderdaddy.com).Very few here, if any, are capable of outdoing a whale&#039;s bot the proper way. Its going to have to get dirty.
&gt;&gt;2374191This is literally what I just done, dumped XEM for Decred. Will buy back XEM again when it falls to 5k.
&gt;&gt;2375245&gt;&gt;2375499&gt;&gt;2375520I&#039;m not &quot;experienced&quot; with these bots, I just recognize their patterns and how they manipulate the price of coins to gain BTC.When will they stop? When they stop making the people using them money, obviously, then they will move onto the next most lucrative coin to destroy.I find it hilarious that traderdaddy.com&#039;s website makes it look like they &quot;help&quot; coins by keeping their trade balanced. it&#039;s a bunch of horseshit.it just generates little micro pump and dump swings in the pricing.
&gt;&gt;2374849Be glad that you got in before it hits $200. The price it&#039;s at currently absurdly low, just look at how small the market cap and coin supply is. Decentralised exchanges are the future and they already have a working one. Not to mention that they&#039;re also building an internet of blockchains just like Ark.
&gt;&gt;2373419they cannot explain.they are trying to rationalize the fact that the price is falling while they want it to moon.whales,soros,illuminati, manipulatorsif you see value hold, I do.
&gt;&gt;2375578If we drive up volume to a high enough point, won&#039;t it force the price floor to go up thereby ruining the bot&#039;s pattern?If so, we should probably start advertising this coin outside of /biz/. Shills irritate me as much as the next guy, but what choice do we have? There need to be organic changes in the price floor for us to get rid of the bot which could be achieved by getting more people interested enough in the coin to buy it. If we could do this, we&#039;d be able to get rid of the bot. Obviously, it wouldn&#039;t be a simple nor fast solution but we have our only other choices are doxxing traderdaddy or just waiting it out.
&gt;&gt;2375620the bot is running on Block right now. and from the looks of it, it has been for a while
always the same pattern, down to 32000 then up to 36000, easy money
&gt;&gt;2375641haha. dude, the guy that runs the botting site admitted he had users manipulating this coins prices. it&#039;s not a fucking conspiracy.
&gt;&gt;2375685it&#039;s totally expected in an AnCap phenomenon that is crypto
IMPORTANT QUESTION:Is this &quot;fuzzyhobbit&quot; guy in&gt;&gt;2373885pic related the main suspect of manipulating ARK with a bot?If so, I may have a major lead on who he is.But I need a yes or no to this question first.Need an answer ASAP.
&gt;&gt;2375893yeshe is at least an admin on the site if not the sites owner
bots are about to push the price to 36k btw.
&gt;&gt;2375893Don&#039;t please. He&#039;s keeping Ark low-ish for the moment and I need time to buy. This shit is going to be worth 100$ in a year.
&gt;&gt;2375940I decided to fuck it and start trading with the bot.Bought a few at 32501, gonna start making extra btc/ark
&gt;&gt;2375940
&gt;&gt;2375999&gt;&gt;2376025it&#039;s about the best we can do right now. can&#039;t beat em? join em...
&gt;&gt;2376061I&#039;m actually really surprised I bought near the absolute bottom of the dip. Must have gotten lucky with the timing
Some weird things happening on Ubiq tooreminder : Ubiq also is only on Bittrex
&gt;&gt;2375893What are you going to do?
He&#039;s back at it again
you&#039;ll notice strange shit where there&#039;s a lot of buying out of the bids book rather than the asks. i believe that&#039;s the bot buying from himself. to make it appear that there&#039;s people buying.
&gt;&gt;2376092that doesn&#039;t look like the same bot, but it definitely looks like a whale trying to force the price down.181 btc ask order, holy fuck
&gt;&gt;2376171Imagine how mad I am haha
&gt;&gt;2375665There are bots running on near enough every coin of value. The scumbags at Bittrex and Poloniex don&#039;t care since they make a ton of money from the constant tx fees.
Damn shits getting corrupt. Dgb, strat, and now ark are totally at the mercy of whales
&gt;&gt;2376247I would be mad, but I plan on holding these bags for a year or two, cba with that day trading shit with all the bots manipulating prices. So I won&#039;t even remember these price swings when it&#039;s time for me to sell.
&gt;&gt;2376375well that would mean that we can expect a insane pump soon. im okey with that
Are you all ready to lose 90% of your portfolio?https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XBTEUR/6IgJz7xg-XBTEUR-To-the-gamblers-latecomers-and-bubble-chasers/

Eh no worries here I&#039;ve seen this happen before and it&#039;ll just recover like it always does

Says the increasingly nervous man for the 100th time
&gt;&gt;2375123&gt;&gt;2375140these are some solid arguments, boys
&gt;&gt;2374677&gt;check out ma autism lines and shiet bruh i sold my crypto now it risky 4u all
&gt;&gt;2375149just as solid as your picrelated
&gt;&gt;2374677If you are not ready to lose 90% of your portfolio for some time, you need a different hobby.
Why does that random trader command more respect than any other random trader who says things will pop at &#039;x&#039; rather than &#039;y&#039;.It&#039;s all subjective and fear-mongering.And he says it&#039;ll drop to 300 euros. That&#039;s absolutely laughable. How the fuck do these people get &quot;followers&quot;?
&gt;&gt;2375236&gt;And he says it&#039;ll drop to 300 euros.Tbh I can see that happening, especially if the UASF goes bananas. btc has gone from 1200 to 200 before.
&gt;&gt;2374677&gt; consider donating 10% of profitsClearly this man is not in the business of making money, why would we listen to him?
&gt;&gt;2374677I&#039;m honestly hoping for a big crash back down to like $200 because I missed out on most of the gains during the first half of this year and I want to have that opportunity again. I don&#039;t even care if it means losing 90% of my money in the short term.

Gee, if only there was a mechanism to hedge risk by allowing you to set some kind of LIMIT to how low your holdings can go before you automatically sell to STOP your LOSS. It would be especially nice if crypto had grown so much that you could set this sooo far above what you actually paid that you&#039;re pretty much guaranteed to still come away in the green.but alas, no such system exists, so us coiners will likely wake up tomorrow with absolutely no money. I guess no coiners do always win in the end.
&gt;&gt;2374677&gt;Are you all ready to lose 90% of your portfolio?I&#039;ll just buy the dip.
&gt;&gt;2375419if market dips 90% i&#039;d dump my 30k fiat straight into itthese guys need to think LONG term

&gt;&gt;2375397this post delighted me and made reading so many dumb threads worthwhile
&gt;&gt;2375569enjoy getting x.1&#039;d annon
&gt;&gt;2375397Most alt-coin exchanges are fiat-locked. If you&#039;re there when the bubble pops, you&#039;re fucked.
&gt;&gt;2375569If you&#039;ve been in this for two or three months, you should be up 5x already at least.
&gt;&gt;2375612less than a week friendo, hence my pessimism
To be fair this guy&#039;s assessments for Ethereum were spot on
&gt;&gt;2375273yes, that&#039;s when a fucking exchange vanished off the fucking planetwhy the fuck do people always leave that out?
&gt;&gt;2374677&gt;consider donating 10% of your profitsDROPPED
fucking retards.if the market dips or crashes hard everyone will put their life savings into it and it&#039;ll go back up/thread
&gt;&gt;2375679They&#039;ve already put their life savings into it.
&gt;&gt;2375720Speak for yourself. I&#039;ve only put 500 of my savings in.
&gt;&gt;2375733If you don&#039;t have the majority of your net worth in crypto, you really don&#039;t get it. I&#039;d imagine most people here do.
&gt;&gt;2375652It&#039;s not particularly relevant, UASF going wrong is a bigger happening than some 3rd party exchange going down and stupid fags who don&#039;t control their own wallets getting burned. + it might happen again, who knows if bittrex or polo are still here in a few weeks?
&gt;&gt;2375756&gt;It&#039;s not particularly relevantMassive amounts of people&#039;s crypto being stolen and dumped is pretty relevant.
&gt;&gt;2375753I believe this was said sometime in 2013 as well
&gt;&gt;2375753That&#039;s just idiotic. At most, you should only be putting 15% of your savings in crypto.
&gt;&gt;2375784Yes, no shit. My point is that most people playing this game aren&#039;t cucks, unlike you, so your &quot;everyone will put their life savings into it&quot; idea doesn&#039;t work.
&gt;&gt;2375787Fine for you, grampa. I am 100% in crypto.Anyway here&#039;s mr. bear (from OP&#039;s post) coping with being wrong about the continued upswing:https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XBTEUR/WUpsZIIr-XBTEUR-Top-didn-t-last-long-China-rescued-bulls/&quot;goldurn chinamen called muh shorts!&#039;
&gt;&gt;23755991. EXCHANGE YOUR CRYPTO FOR BTC2. PAY FOR GOLD AND SILVER USING BTC AT PROVIDENT OR JMB3. BUY IN AMOUNTS THAT DON&#039;T HAVE TO BE REPORTED TO IRS4. RECEIVE YOUR METALS, SELL SOME, KEEP THE REST
&gt;&gt;2375917That&#039;s not what I was referring to. Withdrawal limits.
&gt;&gt;2374677&gt;makes only charts on stocks and other nocoiner shitthe biggest cope there is
&gt;&gt;2375787Agree with this. If all of my crypto goes to zero (not likely) then I still have nearly 0.5M in IRA/401.I can&#039;t lose.
&gt;&gt;2376017Yeah, if you already have half a fucking mil, you can&#039;t lose. Most of us have to risk everything.
&gt;&gt;2376100this exactly. poor my whole life. now i have crypto.made $3k last month, more than i&#039;ve ever made in a month. to many on here that&#039;s pennies but to me it is a door out of hell opening... just an inch for now... but it will continue opening...

Are you getting in the ico? How much eth are you sending?
&gt;&gt;2373916Why would anyone want to get in on an ICO that&#039;s uncapped? It will get at least $200 million. Not a lot of room for profit.Though it&#039;s probably a good long term hold, don&#039;t expect any 10x+ gains.
buywall
&gt;&gt;2373984just wait for 45 minutes and look in their address to see how much ETH they are getting.
staying the fuck away from this kike-ICO
&gt;&gt;2373916might be the perfect time to get in, since eth has increased in value quite significantly over the last week. we&#039;ll be just getting in time for the eth dip
&gt;&gt;2373984I&#039;ve been thinking about this for the last 5 days and my conclusion is that it can 100x but only if the crypto market cap goes to 1 trillion which may only take less than 1.5 years.But yeah long term holding is painful when missing out on everything else gaining.If the BNT can be redeemed through token card or cash it will moon.
&gt;&gt;2374029Bancor has a price floor set in ETH and a hefty inherent ETH reserve.It will likely correlate much with ETH except for new coin uncertainty
Too late to get in the ICO?
&gt;&gt;2374066hasnt even started rofl
&gt;&gt;2374019Goys will be goys
&gt;&gt;2373916ive never seen such kikery.you should see this slimy dev in the slack...&gt;dude we care about the project and the investors more than anything thats why we cant reveal the hidden market cap :) :)cucks are actually defending the devs just fucking lol.
&gt;&gt;2374057Really annoying because it&#039;s a great project but they decided to get greedy. You can&#039;t even wait until the last 10-15 minutes because your transaction might not go through.&gt;&gt;2374001Problem with that is a lot will probably send in the last 10 minutes. So it will be really hard to gauge how much they will get. Way too risky.
Someone in the Bitcointalk thread said that dev Yehuda Levi is a scammer. You can check Appcoin thread by yourself. It&#039;s dead. However you can see this shit in the &quot;about&quot; page on the bancor website.
This thing is going to get like 2m ETH in one hour thanks to unlimited cap and price floor.The devs talked about the price of BNT going up when MORE smart tokens are created, not destroyed... This is a big departure from what is normal. so abundance of BNT tokens is not an issue anymore?I don&#039;t think this is a straight up scam. If it was they wouldn&#039;t keep 50% for (((themselves))). It gives them incentive to actually make their token valuable.Like I said, if normies can buy into the altcoins market by buying BNT with cash and vice versa this will do very well.
&gt;&gt;2373916with ((())) you lose.ALWAYS
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1959435.0scamdo not buy
&gt;&gt;2373995this
Another thing...If you have a shitcoins won&#039;t that incentivise you to to convert it for a BNT since BNT has a price floor? Won&#039;t people throw their shitcoins into Bancor storage as a safe haven and in doing so create more BNT and raise its price?
&gt;&gt;2374209hard security cap is 1m ether mate
&gt;&gt;2374313yes. this is why this coin could potentially kill all shitcoins and shillcoins.
Anyone who supports these jews is a fucking retard.Staying the fuck away from this money grab.
So confused by (((them)))
&gt;&gt;2374313yes exactly. also you will profit if these shitcoins gain bnt value and bnt profits from the demand of bnt to creat shitcoins and bnt profits from the everything aswell.. so you could take interest rate on the interest of interest the uber gains. but biz shills are to retarded to even remotely comprehend what that means
&gt;&gt;2374313That&#039;s their idea behind it. (((They))) want control of the market.It&#039;s designed to suck value from other coins. This is literally The One Ring of crypto.
Wont Bancor succeed simply because its created by a bunch of fucking kikes?
&gt;&gt;2374346&gt;make shit coin&gt;scam everyone who signs up to ICO early&gt;fuck the cap, unlimited firesaleGetting way to big for there boots and they aint even startedThis is going to be entertaining, watch them fuck it all up with a marketcap above 50 Mill usdThese devs think they can be greedy as fuck, take everything they can and it wont (((fuck up))) the brand
&gt;&gt;2374313shhh dont spell it out for the newfags who couldn&#039;t be fucked to read the whitepaper.
i said to bitcoin suiss to exchange my fiat to ETH on ICO date.ETH goes to ATH.FML.
&gt;&gt;2374313&gt;no cap&gt;create excess BNT&gt;still worth fuc all because it started off with market cap in billions&gt;everyone panicking with way too much bancor jew tokens on the market&gt;crashes
i have to say that jewess is kinda hoti might throw 50 bitcoin in this ICO just to get on her radar
&gt;&gt;2374691&gt;doesn&#039;t know about the huge fucking buy wall 80% of excess funds will be used for
&gt;&gt;2374691&gt;100.000 eth buywall on ico price&gt;price goes up&gt;price goes up&gt;wait for the DUP GUIZ WAIT THE DIP PLZ DIIIP PLLLLEASE GIUVE BANCOOOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2374158&quot;Yehuda Levi&quot; most jewish fucking name i ever heard in my life
PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE COIN. IT&#039;S A SCAM TO TAKE CONTROL OF CRYPTO AND TURN IT INTO FIAT.
&gt;&gt;2374714who will actually see these billions in profits, whales and the bancor teamthat&#039;s it. they cashed in the majority of the profit before the company even deployed, by selling the marketcap
&gt;&gt;2374734sounds like a winner
&gt;&gt;2374734&gt;&gt;2374754stay poor noobs
&gt;&gt;2374754you are pretty dumb
&gt;invests in a jewish coin thinking he&#039;s going to make money&gt;/biz/
&gt;&gt;2374831&gt;jew argument&gt;biz
&gt;&gt;2374788Yes yes, &quot;useful person&quot;. Give (((them))) you crypto-earnings to get their shiny preprinted pieces of nothing.
bancor shills, will you be buying ant and token also? They have announced partnerships with bancor
&gt;&gt;2374885already hold a significant amount of ANT.watch bancor become top 3 coin within 1 year.
This is a great informative page for understanding Swarm City. https://queenbeesc.github.io/swarm.city/
&gt;&gt;2369083What is their infatuation with bees? Fucking liberals and &quot;muh disappearing bees&quot;. I can&#039;t take this project seriously.
&gt;&gt;2369146great. fuck what you take seriously.
So you telling me I might be able to cash out of my crypto without having to pay a 30% ass rape by just using it to buy shit ou right with a geo market place... holy fuck this could be huge why is it so cheap? What&#039;s the catch?
&gt;&gt;2369473the catch is that the marketing is shitty and it&#039;s hard to gather information about what it is
&gt;&gt;2369083&gt;another swarm city threadcan you please stop shilling this piece of shit already?
&gt;&gt;2370019Does it have an inflation rate or is it hardcapped?
&gt;&gt;2370037Nigger shut up and look, do you see a top 5 coin in the making? I sure as fuck do.
&gt;&gt;2370039Capped at the amount of arc tokens converted to swt
&gt;&gt;2370077Does Arc have inflation then? Or is it hardcapped too?
&gt;&gt;2370095I&#039;m not sure but there&#039;s only around 2.5 million arcs remaining listed in circulation
not a shill post and factual informative content on /biz/?? wake me the fuck up
&gt;&gt;2370135Alright I&#039;ll definitely check into that part then before doing a larger position on this coin, thank you for the thread and info anon
Btw, SWT is an ERC20 token. Read about it here. https://themerkle.com/what-is-the-erc20-ethereum-token-standard/
&gt;uber is too centralized!&gt;need to use swarm city website to do anything. have to buy swarm tokens to do anything. swarm takes a cut of all transactions, yet provide no legal or financial liability if something goes wrong.&gt;trying to be uber, without an app. have to call &quot;uber&quot; on your browser lmao&gt;swarm city is a scam
&gt;&gt;2370651this, doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t make money off of it tho
&gt;&gt;2370651You completely misunderstand what the project is doing. I really am glad you&#039;ll miss out on the profits of holding SWT tokens.
&gt;&gt;2370651Swarm City is not trying to compete with Uber. It&#039;s a craigslist competitor.
&gt;&gt;2370655What they said was complete nonsense. SWT is going to $100+ and idiots who fail to understand it will be poor like they deserve to be.
Do you think this will go up in the next few days? No memes please, I&#039;m split between putting money on this or Antshares
&gt;&gt;2370693the grand unveiling of the software is in 5 days. Your choice.
&gt;&gt;2370677i&#039;m kidding m8, holding SWT myselflooking forward to the day i receive an email from kraken telling me they added SWT
i don&#039;t know if this shit will succeed but i bought a hundred dollars worth yesterday so i can be the guy who owns #needsucc
&gt;&gt;2370672craigslist is free. why would someone pay for swarm tokens to use service that is already free?&gt;&gt;2370659I understand it perfectly, it&#039;s fucking retarded.Listen to this faggot promote swarm, he literally dodges every single question, even simple ones, and goes on a giant tangent and changes the subject. It&#039;s a scamhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijdmXvw2Q6o
Uber is a billion dollar company. Craigslist is a huge company. Both of them work fine and normies arn&#039;t going to use a cryptocurrency just to sell their shit-covered clothes and 1970s furniture.This coin is facebook for dogs level.
&gt;&gt;2370710I just watched that. He answered every question asked? What are you talking about m8
&gt;&gt;2370710CL is not free if you are a seller mate. Also:Power lies in getting in between people communicating or transacting. In SC, no one can take away the power of the individuals to communicate and transact. CL can say no. Amazon can say no, etc. Plus CL is only the communication part of it, not the trustless payment portion of it.Also, this&gt;&gt;2370729
&gt;&gt;2370710Just because he sucks at explaining it doesn&#039;t make it bad.
&gt;&gt;2370729Ok, so why would someone use swarm city over uber?It&#039;s not fucking cheaper. Uber only takes 15% so I guess you could theoretically save that if you&#039;re a driver using swarm...But what happens when some drunk bitch pukes in your car? What happens when you get into a car accident while you&#039;re on a ride? Who is going to help you? Swarm? No, they&#039;re just taking their cut and have no responsibility for you. LOL.Why would anyone use swarm over uber, why would anyone use swarm over craigslist... you fucking idiot lol
&gt;&gt;2370755when does craigslist ever say no? only for illegal items and swt is not an anonymous coin
&gt;&gt;2370761See&gt;&gt;2370755No regulations = the free market will handle it
&gt;&gt;2370755Yea, they&#039;re clueless of the merits this offers, because they&#039;re immature clueless scum. They probably made easy money on shitcoins and think they&#039;re cool now.
&gt;&gt;2370761Uber and Lyft take 25% and sometimes more, then adds other fees on top of that, and their rates are unprofitably low for drivers.
Drivers hate Uber: https://uberpeople.net/threads/first-time-uber-driver-so-far-so-bad.173037/
&gt;&gt;2370761&gt;thinks Uber will help him when some drunk bitch pukes in his carAlso, this&gt;&gt;2370788
&gt;&gt;2370761One of the benefits of this, is that if enough people are using it, you never have to cash out to fiat, since people will be accepting payments in SWT. That&#039;s an incredible advantage cragslist and uber dont have, and cant have due to their platform.
&gt;&gt;2370819So your best argument for this coin is tax evasion. Do you see how you&#039;re not really making a strong case for this token?
&gt;&gt;2370767Bitcoin is not an anonymous coin either but it&#039;s still the primary payment method used in the dark net markets to buy illegal shit.Craigslist has $300m annual revenues, so that&#039;s how much they skim off the top. That&#039;s a lot of value that can flow to Swarm City users.Obviously Swarm City is not going to replace craigslist anytime soon, just making a point here.
&gt;&gt;2370833If that&#039;s not a strong case then I don&#039;t know what is. Isn&#039;t that what crypto is all about, you cuck?
&gt;&gt;2370833So trading a currency for services is tax evasion now? If you&#039;re not performing a taxable event it isnt tax evasion. But this is moot if we consider the entire purpose of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from the government.
&gt;&gt;2370833&gt;he thinks paying exorbiant taxes is a good thing
&gt;&gt;2370833that&#039;s actually true hahaha. the guy who is &quot;cheef arkitect&quot; describes himself as cryptoanarachist.right now the value proposition is that it&#039;s a marketplace (very rudimental) where you can use cryptocurrency instead of fiat. when people create GUIs on top of marketplaces, and there are easier ways to get SWT, it might work.
&gt;&gt;2370938Well, you dont need fancy to get things done. Normally when you add a ton of features it ends up bloating the system. A simple marketplace is the best.
&gt;&gt;2369083If you want this coin to get more publicity, you should probably mention that they got Dmitry Buterin on their advisory board, just the name should get the attention of the autists on here.
https://press.swarm.city/dmitry-buterin-joins-swarm-city-advisory-board-675d47f268d1related
&gt;&gt;2370984the big question is how active is he with the project? some projects have vitalik himself on the advisory board.
&gt;&gt;2370984I remember watching a live Swarm City hangout with him. Kept thinking how weird it was that he had the same last name as Vitalik. Then I looked him up and realized that this Swarm City project is going to be very serious. This team is well connected, backed by big names, and going places.Fuck your shitcoins, you autists.Futhermore, I also love how the criticism this is getting is reminiscent of the criticism Bitcoin got in 2011.
&gt;&gt;2371070i should have been more open minded and looked deeper into it. fuckk
&gt;&gt;2370019They&#039;re going to release a new website in less than 5 days though. It will be basic but it will get the job done better than the current one.
&gt;&gt;2371089It&#039;s far from too late. Once these ICO guys finish selling (they bought large sums of coins and are already in lambo land), we&#039;ll move up to $100+ quickly, imo.
&gt;&gt;2371134i meant bitcoin. already bought some swt to test it out. might buy more before storefrnt
&gt;&gt;2371146Oh, bitcoin. I remember when I called $100+ in early 2013 and everyone called me a troll.
&gt;&gt;2370768lmao&gt;muh free marketYeah, some bitch pukes in your car, refuses to pay the driver, the driver kills the girl in a fit of rage, swarm goes to zero sats. That&#039;s the free market you retard.&gt;&gt;2370811Yes, they pay you. Ask your mom, she probably drives for uber because it&#039;s clear no one was around to teach you anything you retard.
&gt;&gt;2371180People like you are way the world is enslaved. But your time is running out fast, loser!
&gt;&gt;2371180&gt;Yeah, some bitch pukes in your car, refuses to pay the driver, the driver kills the girl in a fit of rage, swarm goes to zero sats. That&#039;s the free market you retard.You mean this guy? http://www.gq.com/story/the-uber-killerUber is still worth $50B and people keep using it. Maybe not everyone is as stupid as you. Maybe they already understand that there is a 0.00000001% risk that they will get killed anytime they step out of the door anyway?&gt;Ask your mom, she probably drives for uber because it&#039;s clear no one was around to teach you anything you retard.&gt;you thought craigslist was free
&gt;&gt;2371320I don&#039;t use craigslist because I&#039;m not a nigger. People who use craigslist certainly aren&#039;t going to invest in swarm, and normal people who can actually afford to pay for services aren&#039;t going to use swarm either. So who is going to use it? a niche group of retards with no money that you&#039;re a apart of.
&gt;&gt;2371483Lol mate, craigslist is a multi-billion dollar company with $300m in annual revenues. That does not sound like a &#039;niche&#039; to me. Neither does it sound like people who use it don&#039;t have any money.&gt;you also thought Uber charges 15% feesit is 25%
&gt;&gt;2371579I didnt say craigslist was a niche community you illiterate negroid. People with money buy things new because they can afford to own things that weren&#039;t sullied previously by others. People without money or those looking for deals aren&#039;t going to buy a crypto currency so they can use what they can already use for free.Bottom line: no one will use swarm and it won&#039;t take off. cap this.
&gt;&gt;2371698&gt;Bottom line: no one will use swarm and it won&#039;t take off.Doesn&#039;t stop that fact that you could make mad gains tho
&gt;&gt;2371698&gt;People without money or those looking for deals aren&#039;t going to buy a crypto currency so they can use what they can already use for free.The Swarm City platform is actually free unlike craigslist.also lol @ implying that only people with money or people who don&#039;t look for deals are going to buy cryptocurrencies&gt;no one will use swarm and it won&#039;t take off. cap this&gt;nobody will use Uber because we already have taxis for normal people who can actually afford to pay for services&gt;nobody will use Swarm City because we already have craigslist and uber for normal people who can afford to pay 20% markups&gt;buying a cryptocurrency to save money&gt;why would anybody ever do that right
should i dump 0.8 btc into it?
&gt;&gt;2372195Don&#039;t listen to anybody telling you to buy or sell. Do your own research
I got in at 120k sats. Feels good man. Wish I would&#039;ve bought more though. Someone made a really long and convincing post a few days ago and I did some research and I think he wasn&#039;t bullshitting. I really think this thing can hit $15 at the very least.
&gt;&gt;2372256&gt;if you bought in when he posted, you would have easily doubled your money by now
&gt;&gt;2372292Yeah it was $2.99 when I bought and now it&#039;s almost to $6
&gt;&gt;2372532Tfw it was 0.5 usd when I was looking at it but I thought it was too expensive when it went to 1 dollar
&gt;&gt;2372655Same, I did a couple of minutes of research but couldn&#039;t find out what it was so I bailed on it, only to come back later when it had gone up 5x already
&gt;&gt;2372256i bought in after that thread. feels real good.
&gt;&gt;2369146Exactly. Hipsters and SJWs are the loudest vocal minority.I can see a LOT of people being disappointed with this on the 15th lol. Fuck the team isn&#039;t even making an app!What&#039;s going to come out is a buggy mess of a shitty WEBSITE, with only a single #pioneer hashtag available. They wouldn&#039;t even commit to saying when/if they&#039;d unlock the others. If all it took for people to lose confidence in Digibyte is them NOT winning a shitty competition, guess how hard this one&#039;s going to drop.
&gt;&gt;2374122http://g.recordit.co/CCZ75pyKch.gif&gt;does this look shitty to you lol?Of course they committed to unlocking others hashtags, how retarded are you?They will announce their timeframe to open up other hashtags soon enough. It&#039;s just slightly economically sensitive right now because I believe the selection mechanism for letting hashtags show up on the official website will be based on a community vote in which (I think) reputation gained in #pioneer will play a role.
Meh. Bought some but I dont feel it.
Bought 20 swarms. 5 days till the release, the hype isn&#039;t even here yet.
&gt;Parents are forcing me to pay $500 to keep living with them
I pay 800Whats the problem? Still cheaper than living on own
Pro-tip: earn some money.
&gt;&gt;2376226Explain to them you will turn your 500 into 2000 if they let you keep it.
&gt;&gt;2376226You&#039;ll get it back when they die, anon.
&gt;ITT: Neets parents want him out of the house so their marriage will be stable again.
Haha, OP&#039;s parents think he&#039;s a faggot and require money to live with them.
&gt;&gt;2376238The problem is that $500 is a good chunk of money...
&gt;&gt;2376226Kill your self
&gt;&gt;2376267They&#039;re just bad parents; not everyone is fit to parent a child.
&gt;&gt;2376275Yes. But the bigger problem would be a bigger chunk of money.
&gt;250 to live with brother in a separate apartment owned by grandparents
&gt;&gt;2376303it&#039;s called rent you fucking faggot. Your mom probably cooks and shit for you still, so you&#039;re getting a discount you degenerate scum fuck niggerhow about you appreciate the vagina that gave you life a little more
&gt;&gt;2376303you are not OP. awkward
&gt;&gt;2376348I don&#039;t think his mom shits for him too. At least i hope not. Is OP Cartman?
Parents are forcing me to pay 1 bean a minute to keep living with them.
&gt;&gt;2376226mine coins and do laundry every single day. eat all the food you possibly can. fucking hell tho, when my parent instituted pay to live it was only $250
https://tokenmarket.net/ico-calendarWhich ones do you guys have the most confidence in to buy within the first hour of it launching?I&#039;d like to at least get that PnD of BANCORI think SONM will be a worthwhile hodl.Starta looks like that pizza place that was molesting kids.
&gt;&gt;2375274&gt;no one is talking about openanxits like you dont know how important the chinks are
&gt;&gt;2375274sonm looks promising since they seem to address and correct issues with golem and iex. do you have any critical information about sonm?
&gt;&gt;2375366Nope.The only reason I want to buy it is because other people want to buy it. The technology seems to be promising for long term gains.A lot of people will buy them solely due to how nice their website looks.&gt;https://sonm.io/
&gt;low volume delta&gt;more or less flat-line price variations with a standard deviation of less than .25We in accumulation phase boyos
How exactly does a coin fall below 1sat? Looking at the chart it was sitting at 1sat for like 6 months before suddenly spiking and then falling below 1sat for the past year.Is there some weird exchange it was put on that sells it like that?
You were supposed to go UP after hitting the support, not DOWN. Jesus christ.
I&#039;m hodling IDGAF not selling at a loss
&gt;&gt;2375025This but fuck you stratis I&#039;m mad
DGB 2.0
&gt;&gt;2375025I&#039;m hodling and tempted to pick up more. Strats time is still to come.
Worse than digibyte lul
&gt;&gt;2375019Bet the farm on STRAT.Time to neck myself.
&gt;&gt;2375019looks like a downtrend without any indicators for a reverse. you have been trolled, op.
It&#039;s over stratis is finished. Sell now or be ruined
&gt;&gt;2375019people are chasing the ETH pump. STRAT hasn&#039;t even begun to realise it&#039;s potential.speaking as someone who picked up a bunch at 1, 2, and 5 bucks
Yes, please keep selling. I want to get like 2,000 STRAT on the cheap
ITS HAPPENING GET ON BOARD NOW!!!SCREENCAP THIS!!!!
&gt;&gt;2375239GOT U SENPAI
&gt;&gt;2375215how cheap are we talking.
&gt;&gt;2375181Thats the buy signal /biz/
You are foolish if you are not picking up STRAT. The whales have blessed you with this opportunity to go back into the past and pick up more if you haven&#039;t already.
&gt;they bought nigger coinkek
&gt;&gt;2375019next we are going to watch the crash of ARK
&gt;&gt;2375019You trusted a ghetto nigger from Londonistan what the hell did you expect.
&gt;100.000% pumpyou have no idea what you retards are in for, this coin is in for an absolutely massive correction, nothing pumps that hard with correctingim going to buy a few when it hits 40-50 cents though
&gt;tfw you sold all you stratis to get DGG, a coin with an actual future
&gt;&gt;2375019Im still at +1000%
&gt;&gt;2375337delusion: the post
Just wait till support at 24k breaks. The knife will be falling at terminal velocity then.
Fucking hell. Everything&#039;s getting raped today. DGB doing absolutely awful, now Stratis reversing all recent gains.
&gt;&gt;2375395Which is why you keep most of your money in BTC and ETH and only invest a tiny % in any individual alt
&gt;&gt;2375353PFFFT HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAH
&gt;&gt;2375395ARK is nextGet ready to drop as soon as it starts crashing
It&#039;s pretty obvious this is whale manipulation on a massive scale. They want to buy as much STRAT as possible by making people FUD and sell theirs, then pump it to high heaven for maximum gains.If you&#039;re smart then you&#039;d be taking advantage of the whales manipulation because STRAT has the potential to reach $20 a coin soon, if not $30 - 50 by the end of the year.
&gt;&gt;2375403Indeed.
&gt;&gt;2375539I need to lock in my loses so I can buy something ATH
&gt;&gt;2375539There&#039;s no doubt Strat is a good long term hold. Only way Strat crashes is if the entire market crashes.For long term hodlers this dip shouldn&#039;t be an issue. Only day traders get fucked.
&gt;&gt;2375057At least strat has active developers.
&gt;&gt;2375019&gt;I HURT MYSELF TODAYAll you had to do wasBUYTHEBEAN
GODDAMN YOU STRATIS.I DONT CARE THOUGH I STILL MADE MONEY FROM SWARMCITY AND ETHER
&gt;&gt;2375019Support might be at 222k sats, not sure.
&gt;&gt;2376089It is anon, good of you to see it. As a reward I&#039;ll tell you to put your buys orders there. Thank me laterSincerely, a friendly whale
Seriously, this is your best chance to get a lambo by the end of june.&gt;propably the most secure public blockchain&gt;got on bittrex just today (the only exchange which offers QRL atm)&gt;paper thin walls&gt;guarantee of multiplying its value in a few days/hoursGet in now or stay poor anon.
Just bought some, hope you are right.

fomo has started
&gt;&gt;2371206Becuz I am busy buying MAID at the dip and hodling my ETH
&gt;&gt;2371588It&#039;s already 11% up. Think wisely.
Put in $200 on this. Would be nice to walk away with a few thousand.
&gt;&gt;2371664The impressive volume is what swayed me. Good for a quick buck at the least, if not a potential long-term hold.
bump
&gt;&gt;2371599It&#039;s already up pver 1000%ICO price was $.08 Now it&#039;s over a dollar on the first day.
&gt;&gt;2372010So what&#039;s next? A dip?
Why should I invest in this? Im thinking about it but im not sold yet
I listened to you fucks when you said to buy zencash and lost over half my shit. Will i be down to 25% of my initial investment if i buy this?
&gt;&gt;2372270Just put in something small like $100-200. That way if it goes parabolic you&#039;ll make some decent cash and if you lose it then meh.
just
price is fluctuating so much, too risky to buy. I&#039;ll take a look tomorrow!

&gt;&gt;2373096&gt;Trying to bait desperate poor people into your PnD schemes&gt;Somehow I am the jewRight&gt;&gt;2373113Except the typing style and word choice of these faggots is always the same. Next time they will be saying how you have to be literally retarded to not buy this.
how is this a Pnd? when did accumulation happen? it&#039;s not fucking possible. it&#039;s not how that shit works.these posts trying to warn others are by butt hurt bitches that got fucked over by chasing pumps.I&#039;d be pissed if I bought a fuck ton of some pajeet-magnets too.Buy in or dont.
&gt;&gt;2371206was waiting for the price to drop saw it when it was about 97 cent
Python-based blockchain ledger utilising hash-based one-time merkle tree signature scheme (XMSS) instead of ECDSA. Proof-of-stake block selection via HMAC_DRBG PRF and a signed iterative hash chain reveal scheme.Hash-based signatures means larger transactions (6kb per tx, binary), longer keypair generation times and the need to record &#039;state&#039; of transactions as each keypair can only be used once safely. Merkle tree usage enables a single address to be used for signing numerous transactions (up to 2^13 computationally easily enough). Transactions have an incremented nonce to allow wallets to know which MSS keypair to use - currently Lamport-Diffie and Winternitz one-time signatures as part of merkle signature schemes and XMSS/W-OTS+ are natively supported.&gt;buy now or cry later
Look at walls again. HAHA see u in 1000 sats

&gt;&gt;2371206these guys got invited to Google&#039;s upcoming Quantum event.definitely worth putting 10% of your portfolio into them. very anti-fragile investment.
&gt;&gt;2375254Source?
this coin is being artificially manipulated by traderdaddy.com bots, pay attention to the sell orders. see the wall locations. they create 2-3k price swings and siphon btc.
&gt;can&#039;t daytrade crypto because every time it hits fiat you&#039;re subject to 765467897 tax laws
Just hold it for a year you stupid fucking faggot
&gt;&gt;2375477If you an Amerifat that is.......... Euroes baby
&gt;tfw no capital gains tax here
&gt;&gt;2375477emigrate when you make it.
&gt;&gt;2375477USDT is not technically fiat.
&gt;&gt;2375477I make gains, trade for BTC, then use that BTC to buy silver and gold from Provident in amounts too small to be reported. I then sell some of that gold and silver and keep the rest.
&gt;&gt;2375577that sounds like a lot of effort desu henpoi
&gt;&gt;2375577Assuming that&#039;s your picture, what&#039;s that band in the upper right?
&gt;&gt;2375577where do you sell your gold and silver?
&gt;&gt;2375577I love you thank you for this tip.
&gt;&gt;2375577Sounds like structuring to me
&gt;&gt;2376045&gt;&gt;2376081he&#039;s role playing, and what he&#039;s claiming he&#039;s doing is still very illegal and if you&#039;re in the U.S. you will get caught if you do it enough times.
&gt;&gt;2375577How do you buy gold/silver with btc?
&gt;&gt;2376271I just looked at provident metals&#039; website and one of their payment options is BTC.&gt;&gt;2376103Is it because it is considered tax evasion? I&#039;m also just curious because I have a gold coin from 25 years ago that is now worth a pretty penny and am looking to sell it.
DGB Minecraft launches in 10 minutes - We&#039;re going to the MOON. Don&#039;t miss the party
&gt;&gt;2370792Still a shitcoin
its up now
Buy low before the pump - Last chanche to get in this low
&gt;&gt;2370792Doesn&#039;t even work
That doesn&#039;t even affect the coin price.Look, we&#039;ve been patient for the CitiBank conference and we now need to wait for another fucking month for the &quot;real results&quot; to come out in July.Now we have this fucking minecraft server that no one knows about and we&#039;re supposed to sit here watch our money dwindle more and more by the hour while the promise never arrives?fuck off cunt, i&#039;m out. I&#039;m done with this shit.
People panic sold. No big deal. Correction is coming. This is the time to buy low.
What&#039;s the point of this server anyway?Do you get coins for playing?
&gt;&gt;2370880&gt;0 retweets and 0 likesmy fucking sides, what a garbage coin
What&#039;s the point of a deposit? Is that a scam?
I don&#039;t know.
I admire the will /biz/ is giving this coin. I bought 3k DGB now. will sell at 2k sat though. this shit is a funny meme.
tbqh i sold 40% and going to store it safely in ethwill buy back in if it dips below 1k, if it moons, then i still got 110k, so no worriessecuring profits is important to me DESU
Funny thing is that this always happens. People panic and they sale and then regret their panic sale.EVERYTIMEI do not understand it.Simple dgb is one of the best coins. It still is even after &quot;bad&quot; news. Nothing has changed.Hold/buy this coin. If it was easy to see through the fog everybody would be rich. In hindsight you will understand you should not have sold this coin!Dgb will be top 5 100%I have been on bumpy roads before and I always made big money with my strong patient hands!Buy now or cry later
&gt;&gt;2371164What is the maximum price that this coin can achieve?Is $100 too far fetched in the future?
&gt;&gt;2371164Agree.. it was overhyped and now is flying under the radar. It might drop a little more because of fudders but it&#039;s looking like a good pick up for me at this price point
&gt;&gt;2371164Funny thing is that his always happens. People panic and they go full denial and then regret their bag holding.EVERYTIMEI do not understand it.Simple dgb is one of the worst coins. It still is even after &quot;good&quot; news. Nothing has changed.Stop loss already. If it was hard to do some research everyone would be poor. In hindsight you will never understand why you bought this in the first place!Dgb will be the new PoSW 100%I have been on bumpy roads before and i always made big money by having common sense!Do whatever you want, you were already a retard if you fell for this meme
&gt;&gt;2371164&gt;EVERYTIMENot at all, why lie like that.This coin was hyped af, people like you bought it too expensive, the Citibank presentation was terrible, people realized the hype was probably gone, they take their profits home while you sit crying.No regrets selling here. Thanks for buying.
&gt;&gt;2371181If it reached $100 then its market cap would be $800 billion.What do you think?
&gt;&gt;2371229
&gt;&gt;2371181&gt;Is $100 too far fetched in the future?Obviously.The target for DGB even by the DGB devs is 1-10$.A bump up to 1$ by the end of the year is still possible, eventhough it looks unlikely right now.
&gt;&gt;2371181A 10B market cap is not out of the questionSo yes $1 is likely
&gt;&gt;2371255&gt;A bump up to 1$ by the end of the year is still possiblethat was never possible you retard!
After this cools down I&#039;m expecting 3k sats just like I was before.A correction had to happen. Don&#039;t know why some people are surprised or worried over it.
Begin countdown to launch
&gt;&gt;2371574I&#039;m so fucking dumb.
&gt;&gt;2371585How so?
&gt;&gt;2371621That&#039;s ETC&#039;s chart, not DGB&#039;s.
Went down the toilet on that ugly bitch.
will you be able to mine DGB on the server or just gamble with DGB?
&gt;&gt;2373157You mine that DGB.You&#039;re suppose to mine precious ores within the game and the quantity of the ore translates to the quantity of DGB that gets deposited to your wallet.
I&#039;m gonna raid some minecraft kids clubs and tell them to deposit to my address lolGonna have a slave army of kids mining ore for my digi riches
I can&#039;t register to play, but 75 people are playing.
&gt;&gt;2373270Pretty sure one of them is Gabe.
&gt;&gt;2373270Does the server have a limit?I don&#039;t know how minecraft works
&gt;&gt;2371255&gt;So im kinda new a few months. What were people saying about ETH and BTC back in the day? Did they say it will be impossible to reach a certain amount because of the market cap?It is a possibility though to reach $50 or $100 no? Ya right now it looks impossible.
&gt;&gt;2373598People were doubting ETH before it was a dollar.Thing is, the market cap of the entire crypto market has changed, and although it is still incredibly young, it would be very big to see DGB at ETH levels.$1 isn&#039;t that strange if you look at the longterm, a couple years or so.
&gt;&gt;2370974&gt;&quot;real results&quot;theyre going to watch the winners of the regional competition, which they lost yesterday, go on to compete for the final prizes in july.
Played on the server for about an hour. Found tons of iron and got zero DGB for it. Seems like they&#039;ve disabled diamond from generating. Scam?
&gt;&gt;2373745Its the same story with lol of legends0.1 dgb for a win0.01 dgb for a killyoud need 2000 hours of play for like 100 dgb
&gt;massive sell off ongoing&gt;day traders dipping in an out to ride the wave down&gt;going to the moon
&gt;&gt;2373865&gt;whales manipulating price down&gt;volume is steady&gt;buy orders going upSounds good to me.
&gt;&gt;2373178Been a while since I played minecraft but getting paid to do so is pretty tempting, think I&#039;m going to get in on this.
&gt;&gt;2373745diamonds were always pretty rare.
due to the price of DGB and the total amount of DGB and the amount of players that will try to earn DGB.. dont get your hopes up on finding more than 1-10 DGB in the game/day. If they gave out too much someone would be taking a huge loss.
&gt;&gt;2373745how did you even start? Couldn&#039;t do a thing in survival
&gt;&gt;2373178So if I get a hacked Minecraft client with xray, I&#039;m set?
&gt;&gt;2373289Been a while since I played, but IIRC you can set the amount of people who can play on your server. That being said, I&#039;ve been on big servers with hundreds of people, but you need good server hosting for that.
&gt;&gt;2373745Does the server have PVP?
&gt;&gt;2371572Why were you expecting 3000 sats?What did they do to deserve it going up to 3000 sats? What happened to the coin to make it suddenly worth 3000 sat?Answer me.
Can I enter the minecraft server with a torrented version of minecraft?
&gt;&gt;2373745&gt;you literally have MANUALLY mine to get DGBfucking LOL, I&#039;m honestly shocked people believe this will take off, they couldn&#039;t figure out how to fucking run a mining protocol to just mine while you play?!?!
&gt;&gt;2371181$1 is pretty much the max
&gt;&gt;2371574lel.
&gt;&gt;2374787Better than most scamcoins. it has an application and I could see ingame Diamonds trading for DGB.
&gt;&gt;2371137If you capitalize desu again you&#039;re a fag.
so how much can i sell shit for on this server
&gt;&gt;2374815At this point, 2k sats is max. We&#039;re fucked.Notice how this minecraft server didn&#039;t affect the price plummeting. It literally means nothing. This and citibank were hype over nothing.
&gt;&gt;2375421when should I buy?Also anyone, can you only sell diamond on this thing?
It&#039;s fucking crashed. No moonride for us lads. Bubble pops. Save the rest ofyour money while you can
&gt;&gt;2375446Never, DGB is dead. Why the fuck would you buy something on a total downtrend into oblivion?But if you want to, why not now; it&#039;s 1350.
&gt;&gt;2375471Why is it dead?
&gt;&gt;2375489Look at the price. Total meltdown. Who will want to invest in this when it can easily plummet some more, perhaps even below 1k sats? Recovered a bit to 1650 today and proceeded to crash back down to 1300&#039;s.At this point, the downtrend seems to be continuing and there is nothing (i.e. hype) to bring it back up. No one will fall for the same bullshit with Citibank in July again.
&gt;&gt;2375489Because it&#039;s a shitcoin with no fiture and practical use. There was a hope about citi tech contest but now delusions vanished like a fart on the wind
&gt;&gt;2375514Which part of buy low and sell high you dont understand. And your argument of &quot;it could plummet down more&quot; is retarded, youre in trading business, what the actual fuck
&gt;&gt;2375647What&#039;s the trend showing?Yes, you can buy now, but it can easily dip into the 1200&#039;s, lose more confidence and cause panic dumps, and then go back to &lt;1000 sats.
&gt;&gt;2375548&gt;it&#039;s a shitcoin with no fiture and practical use&gt;There was a hope about citi techpick one dudealso, consider unnatural pumping as unnatural pumping, and dumping ... you should already know this by now
&gt;&gt;2371022im hold dgbbut that was funny as fuck kek
&gt;&gt;2371072how can join the server

I am currently in the year 2053. Today is still remembered as The Giga Pump anniversary. This is because today, the greatest pump in history propelled Ethereum to an absurd price instantly creating a huge amount of millionaires in a single day. Literally a &quot;glitch&quot; in the history of finance.

buy ETH
Buy LSK
Are you buying more now or waiting for the dip?I can&#039;t sell now. I don&#039;t wanna bet on a dip that might not happen.But I&#039;m torn between buying more and waiting for the fabled dip. I remember when it dipped nearly 100 dollars at 220 and then quickly corrected.
&gt;&gt;2376116i bought more and it&#039;s going to go up, up, up!
same situation herejust wait for a dip. worst case you profit off ur eth going up so its win win
&gt;cheap as fuck&gt;original application&gt;covers a massive untapped market&gt;dedicated devs&gt;even if you don&#039;t believe that, whales do (see: Keynesian beauty contest)Remind me again why this is a &quot;PnD scam&quot; and a &quot;shitcoin&quot;?&gt;inb4 shillThe facts don&#039;t lie
&gt;&gt;2372347cuz they wanna buy it cheaper and know that /biz is full up with weakhanded cucks who know fuckall about the coin cuz they only do research on biz and never visit a coinpage or even heard of a whitepaper.
Its not a shitcoin or a scam.you&#039;ll be the one laughing in the end.
Bought in at 100.
&gt;&gt;2372402see you on the moon son
&gt;&gt;2372402mad cash
&gt;&gt;2372347&gt;cheap as fuckWRONGI bought 500k for $45.That&#039;s turned into $1400. Had I known it would get this high, I would have bought millions.
&gt;&gt;2372595&gt;Had I knownLearn TA. IF you learn to draw the right triangles you can predict with 99.9% accuracy.
How about you hop on the next siacoin instead of talking about this shitcoin?ECC volume and buy orders picking up steam right now
&gt;&gt;2372619&quot;Pay no attention to the 60BTC buy order at 90 sats, and the last 100 transactions that are ~10BTC, this totally isn&#039;t a whale shilling to buy in cheap guys, it&#039;s a shitcoin thats totally gonna fail the lead dev never posts even though you can see his daily posts if you fucking google search cryptognasher&quot;gg cucks, panic sell now you dont deserve a lambo
&gt;&gt;2372595Bought 250k at about 6sat.Feels good.
&gt;&gt;2372347DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED FAGGOTS.
&gt;&gt;2372595&gt;tfw only bought 3.1 million at 5sats
&gt;&gt;2372347I have some that I bought out of FOMO, but I&#039;m not holding my breath that this thing is going to be adopted by any major platforms like the devs keep alluding to.Their team sounds like a bunch of lazy fucks that gave up on their own idea until their coin was used in a PnD. Then all of a sudden they had renewed interest.
&gt;&gt;2372982It doesn&#039;t need to be integrated by the likes of twitter etc, it&#039;s a browser extension, search reddcoin in the chrome app section and then reply to someone on twitter, it&#039;s built right into the UIIt&#039;s absolutely beautiful
My advice if already bought a ton is to stake. Literally free money.
&gt;&gt;2372982&gt;implying it needs to be adopted by major platforms to take offit is a browser plug in meant to work across platforms, in a decentralized manner.Literally, no social media needs to pick it up
&gt; bought at 105&gt;already dropped to 99I hate you all
&gt;&gt;2373160&gt;expecting immediate resultsjust hodl man
&gt;&gt;2373160you better be shitting me!STOP CRYING and HOLD till it takes of for fuck&#039;s sake!4 satoshi drop is nothing kek
&gt;&gt;2373160Newfag detected. KYS if you are this fucking impatient.
&gt;&gt;2372595&gt;tfw only bought 17 billion at .0001sat
Twitch already has Bits. RDD is not getting adopted by TwitchAnd no, Grandma is not going to learn crypto to tip your Facebook posts with RDD
just bought 100k i unironically see this has a lot of potential and will definitely stabilize over 100sats in time
RDD will be 1000 sats soon, not a question of IF but when. Within the next 2 months most likely.Btw, Verge pumping now, the whale is there. My guess is next week its RDDs turn and will pump again to 150&#039;ish.
&gt;&gt;2373224&gt;tfw only bought 6 gorillion at.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 sats
I got about 1M at 50, but I&#039;m getting a bit impatient with how slow it&#039;s goingXVG too is giving me similar feelings
&gt;&gt;2373284why are you being impatient? your investment has already doubled.
&gt;&gt;2372347Great video about trading 5th wave fractals and ABC corrections in RDD.5th wave is 180 sats btw. Get in now.https://youtu.be/3EYxedDWTvA?t=3m20s
&gt;&gt;2372347This shit won&#039;t moon until Redd-ID is out, until then it will be hovering around 100 sat.
&gt;&gt;2372982&gt;PnDDoes this look like a PnD to you? Those corrections are too small.
ez
I just want my 140k to get above 118 sat
&gt;&gt;2372604What does TA stand for? Serious question
&gt;&gt;2374347Technical analysis (see Bollinger bands, simple moving averages (SMA), etc. etc. and most importantly, drawing random lines on a graph)
&gt;&gt;2374347Outdated meme lines that no professionals use but /biz/inessmen are too dumb to use quantitative analysis so it&#039;s all they have
Strong technology, active development, passionate community, high volume, these are the signs of a popular healthy coin.PnD&#039;s come and go but Reddcoin prevails. Get in before it jumps up again.
It&#039;s going to break 1K SAT once Redd ID is outHold onto your coins you fucking fragile emoitonal pussys
&gt;&gt;2374524Those walls are steep. Im in for 750k nut its going to take massive buying to cut into that mountain of sell orders.
&gt;&gt;2374594Some sell orders like that are programmatically placed from bots, this goes for all coins btw. They move automatically at certain points based on margins to scare individual buyers.
&gt;&gt;2374676I dont trade based on the book. I do charts with and also take into account perception.I do know what you mean but I have yet to see any of them pulled even yesterday with the run to 115.We just need a volume spike.
&gt;&gt;2374579Once redd id is out it will probably reach at least 4k at peak. We will see this slowly going to 200 sats as the days approach.
&gt;&gt;2374741Thats roughly 1.6 billion. Why do you think thats possible.Im looking for 800 to 1k sats.
&gt;&gt;2374741It won&#039;t reach 4K at peak lolIt will hit 1K. 1K is reasonableLets not BS ourselves here
&gt;&gt;2372347It really is the coin with the most potential right now.It&#039;s following all the same patterns of other successful coins and has a weekly 2X increase in value.And once Redd ID is out, this will be major news, which is the time to sell.Oh well. Less people emotionally buying means less people panic selling later on. Good time to accumulate while it is bouncing around 100 sats. I wish I had got in at the 25 mark when I had the chance.
bought 170ktake me to 1k sats pls
&gt;&gt;2373002&gt;&gt;2373038&gt;&gt;2374169Yeah, none of this eases my concerns about the Devs that left this project largely unattended until a surge in their price, at which time they decided to pick the project up again.

&gt;&gt;2375714I can&#039;t blame them for losing enthusiasm when their efforts weren&#039;t rewarded, better that they doubled down on their focus once it surged rather than pull out and make easy bank.Either way, they&#039;re clearly dedicated to it now and have a monetary interest in putting out effective code.
&gt;&gt;2375770Are you shilling for or against RDD? Cant tell from this thread, you keep bouncing around.It&#039;s very reasonable to believe this coin will reach 1K sats. And buying it at 100 sats is a decent strategy, especially since it bounces between 98 to 105 sats daily. You could even daytrade it and make an average 5% gain.That&#039;s not as great as catching onto the other shilled coins on the pump, but it is still pretty consistent for steady gains or accumulation.
&gt;&gt;2375911&gt;Nah bud, I&#039;m in it for the long term. I see MASSIVE potential in this coin. The people that don&#039;t are the day traders that sell on emotion. I&#039;m holding for a year or two
&gt;&gt;2375862You don&#039;t know wtf you are talking about. The lead dev has been active since the start of 2016.Stfu you shitty shill and learn to read: https://www.reddcoin.com/author/gnasher

&gt;&gt;2376062&gt;you shitty shillHow am I shilling RDD? I was giving it a fair shot. You&#039;re the one here who seems a bit too emotionally invested.
it&#039;s coming..and when it does it will be the first to be easily used publicly.&gt;Where were you when the utility phase of investment set in? Why were you still bagholding moon coin and DGB grandpa?https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/reddcoin
I was bagholding eth and btc
so easy, even a normie could use it
stop shilling this shit it&#039;s cheap and will rise to get us some neat profit but it&#039;s not going to moon and make us millionaires you dummy
Twitch already has Bits which makes them profit. They will never use RDDStop spreading fake news
&gt;&gt;2373255your on a business forum where the topic of cryptocurrency investments is discussed. Deal w the shills man&gt;&gt;2373267&gt;implying Twitch needs to adopt thisIt&#039;s a google chrome browser extension buddy. no need for any platform to adopt
&gt;&gt;2373267&gt;&gt;2373255&gt;&gt;2373222This coin is so real I hurt with joy whenever I see the fuds cry over missing their tickets.
&gt;&gt;2373325i&#039;m not fudding you tard i have over 100k, when shit even reaches 1k sats i&#039;ll be sitting so pretty i&#039;ll probably cry irl
&gt;&gt;2373351I have 2 million. bought at 5 sats.At this point, i&#039;m not even shilling. just keeping pressure on devs cuz i legit wanna use this coin, and legit wanna get tipped on my social media accounts (i have overall 80K+ followers)
what&#039;s to stop me from taking @lirik for myself?
shiiiiiiit&#039;s going to break 1K sats when it Redd-ID is out
&gt;&gt;2374562&gt;it&#039;s going to break 1K sats when it Redd-ID is outyeah but when the fuck is this shit coming out, there is zero interaction with the devs about it. I&#039;ll hold onto it for a week and see what happens
Wait, RDD isn&#039;t just a pump and dump that got out of control?
&gt;&gt;2374611Lol? do you nigga even read?
&gt;&gt;2374611its the dgb of this weak.whales need to get richer somehow
&gt;&gt;2373267Most of twitch donations already go past twitch.tv over things like streamlab, you would be cutting them out of profits, but then again they might adopt it since it avoids the PayPal chargeback issue
&gt;&gt;2374611You&#039;re retarded if you think this is a Pump and Dump coinmr bit BEAN
Buy fucking DGB. It&#039;s getting dumped and it&#039;s going right back up to where it was before. Don&#039;t miss out on the pump or you&#039;ll get fucked.
&gt;&gt;2376006DGB IS FUCKING SINKING SHIPcope morebuy bitbean instead of digibyteOr just buy Reddcoins because Redd ID is coming out and it&#039;ll 10xLong term good investment
&gt;&gt;2373229yeah and how the normie will get the coins in the first place?
&gt;&gt;2373638It is a trust based system - once you&#039;re found out you will be reported to the authorities for punishment.

Need help. Been using PP for several years. And now they are investigating. I claimed that I do digital paintings/art. Truth is that I make porno paintings which is banable by PP&#039;s policy.They are asking for descriptions of the performed service. They also want to know the websites where I promote my service. Most troubling request is that they want me to forward any email or written communication for several transactions.Clearly I can&#039;t show any of those as they&#039;d ban me instantly.So how can I lie my way out of this ? Any believable lies? Should I tell them that I&#039;ve hired someone from fiverr to spam my service over the web ?
&gt;&gt;2375550Prove it by showing us your art
&gt;&gt;2375550what the fuck is a porno painting
&gt;&gt;2375550&gt;which is banable by PP&#039;s policy.this is why we need cryptobtw, say you advertised on 4chan&#039;s draw threads?then just find random SFW art in obscure places they won&#039;t look and say it&#039;s yours
ditch pp go bitcoin
looks like you&#039;re fucked, boyo
&gt;&gt;2375611I have only 3 payments with bitcoin. Not popular enough with the customers
Should I fake the convos with my clients through google hangouts?
Only way is to fake everything immediately.
&gt;&gt;2375550&gt;Truth is that I make porno paintings which is banable by PP&#039;s policy.What the fuck, why would that be bannable?
Say you are under nda and make 1 or 2 sfw pix
&gt;&gt;2375550Just make something up btw, you can easily fake timestamps on e-mails, say you&#039;ve advertised on 4chan or something.
&gt;&gt;2375796Not believable, they know I live in Lithuania&gt;&gt;2375834Timestamp yes, but they want email forward...
Paypal is the MOST JEWISH SCAMLie to them and fake everything; they&#039;d do the same.
&gt;he didn&#039;t include a small piece of candy and tell paypal he sells artisan treats

So for those familiar with mining, could I tap you for some help? I just got started with my Rx 480, to begin pool mining some ETH (later I&#039;m going to dual mine for Sia Coin as well), and finally got things workings but my hash rate is only hovering in the 24 MH/s whereas I see others with similar cares pull in 124 MH/s.What can I do to boost my hashrate to that level?I&#039;m using:-Claymore&#039;s Dual Ethereum+Decred_Siacoin AMD+NVIDIA GPU Miner v6.1 Beta-AMD 17.4.4 firmware-32gb of RamThanks for the help!
rx480 is the hiz for eth mining from everthing I have read. I just spent half day driving to every besy buy and electronics store within 50 miles trying to find any, they are all like &quot;geee force is better&quot;, rx 470/80 is last year, why do you want that?
&gt;24 MH/sNot sure where you&#039;ve seen reports of 100+ but you&#039;re around where you should be. Most mining charts that I&#039;ve seen list the rx 480 right around there.
you&#039;re not going to get 124 MHs with a 480. I don&#039;t know where the fuck you got that idea from.
&gt;&gt;2375904Get the right drivers first of all. Specific driver versions from AMD help integer calculations and can give you a 15-20% boost.If you&#039;re good, flash the bios for the right voltage. You might fry your rig if you dont know what youre right.&gt;Sia CoinForget the memes. All in on ethereum till it switches to proof of stake. By that time if you dont have enough to open your own stake node and recieve perpetual passive income youll be out of the game.
&gt;&gt;2375904&gt;Rx 480HOW THE FUCK DID YOU FIND ONE!?Tell me where they are in stock!
&gt;&gt;2376201Funny thing is that I have one sitting on my desk that I somehow bricked while trying to mine. Now its not detected by my computer.
&gt;&gt;2375953&gt;&gt;2376201I was lucky I guess, I picked this up on Craigslist for $350 basically new because a guy wanted to change up his gaming rig and swtich to Nvidia. This was before I got into mining, now I&#039;m trying to figure out how to best use it. It&#039;s just a single card so I don&#039;t expect much out of i.&gt;&gt;2376169&gt;By that time if you dont have enough to open your own stake node and recieve perpetual passive income youll be out of the gameThat&#039;s what my hope is, I like Sia for the technology and if I can get another couple hundred on the side I won&#039;t complain.

&gt;&gt;2375841Hey I&#039;m pretty much in the same boat
&gt;&gt;2375907Fortunately I only had ~$500 in on it, sold out for $3k at $295 on ETH last night and wishing I hadn&#039;t put THAT order in before passing out too. It&#039;ll dip back soon.
&gt;&gt;2376117I had a bit more of that in it, and for some retarded reason I saw it at 0.00016 and though &#039;nah I shouldn&#039;t sell now. What a fool I was
&gt;&gt;2375291Why is everyone trashing this? I bought in at 0.00009 and it went up to 0.00012 overnight.
wtf lol
Stairway to heaven
COME ON
&gt;&gt;2376181it&#039;s the traderdaddy.com bot. spread the fucking word. any coin worth it&#039;s shit on bittrex is infested with them causing artificial price swings and siphoning BTC during them.it&#039;s not conspiracy, site admin admitted he had people targeting specific coins on bittrex.

&gt;&gt;2376198[random shitcoin] !!!!!
On my uncle&#039;s bank account 100.000 euros appeared, someone apparently sent them over to him as a mistake? He went to withdraw 100 to the ATM to see if they were available to be taken and yeah they are, is it risky to &#039;make them disappear&#039;? Its that dude&#039;s/bank&#039;s mistake after all
Buy ETH
can&#039;t find uncle on bittrex
&gt;&gt;2376144probably another fucking yobit coin fuck that
Rofl fk off your monopoly money pajeets

Verge whale is back, REJOICE ANONS, ITS MOONING TIME
Question is how high it will goHow are you so sure it&#039;s the whale?
&gt;&gt;2373095it&#039;s dropping like a rock
&gt;&gt;2373095When the t-shirts get in stock, this shit is going fucking mars!
&gt;&gt;2373194Because this whale pumped it from 30 sats to ATH. Each time it joins, price goes up.RDD is exactly the same.This happened many times previously. Just watch
BUYBUYBUBYBUBYBUBYBUBY DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT ITTHe WHALE is BAACK!
Guys, buy in NOW!Sell walls are falling soon. One big one already fell!
&gt;&gt;2373194Extremely large buys + bot activity
AAAAA WAIT FOR ME
I&#039;m in guyssee u on the moon fuckers !
still waiting...
&gt;&gt;2373554Waiting for what nigger, BUY NOW MOTHERFUCKER ITS MOONING
&gt;&gt;2373610that&#039;s why you stay poor
200 by the weekend&#039;s end?
&gt;&gt;2373610I smell shilling
&gt;&gt;2373633bruh.... 1.5 months trades on 1 exchangeAdd Polo + Bittrex = Game Over :))))
&gt;&gt;2373730sure buddy
Yesssss. Buy my stale ass open orders please.
1usd when?
Damn I feel sorry for anyone that fell for this scam lol. Ive never come across this before and im still learning shit so i just went and checked it out to see what would happen. That 1000 every 3-5 second guy in the buy orders is a bot that buys a tad shorter than the ask/bid and is programed to always follow this trend. Then after like 10-15 buys he dumps the amount+ a little extra through like 4-5 accounts. Man that&#039;s fucked HAHA.
&gt;&gt;2373958the whales use bots to handle their huge transactions
it&#039;s not going anywhere any time soon. Infact, it might drop down close to 120. Volume dropping faster than a kardashian&#039;s panties.
&gt;&gt;2373958First of all, the bot is paying the ask. Second, how is that profitable at all? 10-15 buys is not enough to move up the bid so he&#039;d be selling at a loss 90%+ of the time
What a shitty answer. You are either friends with the guy or the faggot himself.
&gt;&gt;2374044Not an argument.
Are we fucked?
&gt;&gt;2374095Probably a little bit short term. Whale may keep the price low for a while.
&gt;&gt;2374145buy the rumor, sell the newsI mean they profited so much off the Tor and i2p clients announcement.Buy the alphabay and Tails OS client rumor.They haven&#039;t released their roadmap yet.If rumors are true I could see 1000 sats with druggies flooding in.
&gt;&gt;2374190I&#039;ve been in since 98 SATs. This is the rumor I was waiting for.
&gt;&gt;2374212same herehope shit will get serious soon-ishwould like to get some return on this shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2373095This coin is the ultimate game changer, Once people know that Monero is a shitcoin that can be traced everyone will jump of that shit and go to Verge.But don&#039;t listen to me, i&#039;m just a 50mil verge holder =]
YES finally. Been waiting 8 days for this shit.
This was the dip, 135 lowest, now hovering around 150, will pump soon. Buy in now.
&gt;&gt;2374423Why is Verge the best of all the other anonymous coins in your opinion?
90% of all Verge is owned by 50 PeopleIts a shitty shill coin with a shitty community. Don&#039;t buy this POS coin. Just wait for it to dip back to the 40 sat range and put some money in then. ITS NOT WORTH IT.
&gt;&gt;2374766Last chance now, we&#039;re going towards 200 and beyond.
&gt;&gt;2374897&gt;90% of all Verge is owned by 50 PeopleRedpill me on this. Where can I find this information?
&gt;&gt;2374926http://vergecurrency.info/richlist?utm_content=bufferfde2f&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer94%sorry 100 not 50.
&gt;&gt;2374924Show me where you got that instead of posting a shitty SS thats faked.
&gt;&gt;2374924Probably the tor Android or iPhone wallet. If he&#039;s ahead of schedule, he may post both.&gt;&gt;2374974It&#039;s on the telegram. You can hop in and ask him about it. He&#039;s available most hours of the day. He live posts while he&#039;s working on new releases.
I made the dumb fucking mistake of putting my XVG on Coinomi, now they&#039;re doing &quot;maintenance&quot; and I have no access to my coins. So, I suppose I&#039;m going to HODL for better or for worse. My hope is that all the announcements the dev is hyping spike the price soon.
&gt;&gt;2374955&gt;private currency&gt;has a fucking rich listJesus Christ, what have I got myself into...
&gt;&gt;2375522It&#039;s a problem with a lot of coins. They are probably knocking the price down.
&gt;&gt;2375522Verge is not private, they just claim it is because they support IP hiding through TOR and I2P, but other than that it&#039;s a completely normal shitcoin with traceable transactions and addresses and shit.
&gt;&gt;2375897It&#039;s a basic honeypot.Verge is going to be sub 100 by the end of the week.
What does /biz/ think of iconomi and investing in ICN? Seems like a good long term hold and it&#039;s sure to moon sometime this year. I hope you got in when it was sub $1. The buyers will be flooding in once their platform comes out.
&gt;&gt;2376094I got in on the ICO boyo and been holding the whole way. It will hit $100 at some point in the next 2 years
&gt;&gt;2376124&gt;got in at the icoDamn, congrats man. I only learned about it right after the ICO ended. I only have like 600 tokens but if you&#039;re right that&#039;ll be worth 60k. Not bad.
Looking for some of those AIDS resistant memes to guard my dick from cyber terrorists. My dick was worth about 100 btc on the black market 5 years ago now I gotta bargain for 2 doge. I sold my wife to an arab sand farmer for 2 camels and a tranny lost in the desert, his name was Betsy and he wasn&#039;t convincing- best deal of my life. Betsy told me about an overlooked coin with huge potential and more enough aces up their sleeves than a vietnamese hooker on meth. I researched the old whores suggestion and found out her herpes infested lips were telling the truth. I bought Mooncoin at 2 sats and Im still winnin.I found out Mooncoin has some big announcements to be made in the near future.https://discord.gg/HqaNe8a
enjoy going back to 1 sat anon. shits crashing harder than the twin towers
It&#039;ll rebound higher than your moms head count
Im pretty comfy

Counterparty I believe is one way. Why is everyone here so against shitcoins existing? Theyre actually a great way to plan and develop a business.

social network tipping. Normie appeal.Their main product is ready for release and ready to drop anytime this summer.
Yes but might take a few weeks for the proper pump (big news still to come), also XVG dipped today which will pump soon also.
&gt;&gt;2375242is there any news for xvg?
&gt;&gt;2375292No but there is big news to come for RDD.It will easily break 1K SAT once Redd-ID is out
The most stable, undervalued coin while everything else is dipping into the shitter.
&gt;&gt;2375218Keep it at around 100 sats for a while. Don&#039;t buy big.Buy in small bursts as the bots keep the price down in small amounts. This will make it easier to accumulate before the news at the end of the 3rd quarter.Work with and manipulate the bots to accumulate. If you buy too much, they may sell to much and cause panic selling.
I HAD A DREAM ETHERUM WAS 700 A COIN AND I WAKE UP TO SEE ITS 323 ON COINBASEWhere are going to make it ANONS
&gt;&gt;2375316this coin can LITERALLY only go up.Buy now, buy more, buy often.

Good thread, everyone.

my wife&#039;s son saw OP&#039;s image and told my wife and now she won&#039;t let me buy any more eth. good job faggot you probably just ruined my life and my marriage.

&gt;ywn have the opportunity to buy a coin like ethereum at $1 ever againDoes anybody else increasingly feel like killing themselves every day as ETH continues to go up?
&gt;&gt;2375810things like crypto are not once in a lifetime eventsmore like once every 10 yearsthere&#039;s always another gold rush around the corner
&gt;&gt;2375810No. If I&#039;m ever feeling down I just think about Vitalik writing some nice code and everything is peaceful again.
&gt;&gt;2375810But anon, you do
&gt;&gt;2375868This honestly seems like the best option to make the next easy 10x
&gt;&gt;2375848&gt;more like once every 10 yearsThat&#039;s a lifetime to me. I&#039;ll be 40 by then and I will have surely killed myself before then if I have to keep living like a wagecuck.
&gt;&gt;2375848&gt;things like crypto are not once in a lifetime eventsSeashells -&gt; Metals -&gt; Cash -&gt; Credit -&gt; Crypto5 changes in the history of human civilization.
&gt;&gt;2375848this, make sure to invest in astroid mining
&gt;&gt;2375401I hope it dips to 290 this weekend so I can buy up some scaredy-hands
&gt;&gt;2375598Lol I can&#039;t believe people are believing this bait.
&gt;&gt;2375848When in human history has there been another &quot;thing like crypto?&quot; Maybe four other times as&gt;&gt;2375923said.Yes there will always be wacky investment opportunities... there will not however be another &quot;thing like crypto&quot; any time too soon.
August 1st a date we should be worried about?Head people say BTC could spike or dip due to it but what could happen to ETH either way.

5-10 trillion total marketcap, then the NWO has begun
&gt;&gt;2375829we&#039;re probably about halfway through right nowthen a pop, then a slowdown for several monthsthen right back at itseriously this decentralized shit won&#039;t stop, barring total global war or insane solar flare
&gt;&gt;2375829The 24h volume just crossed 5.000.000.000$, the dip last dip happened at this volume, too.It&#039;s getting unstable again, maybe we&#039;re heading into a secound dip. The bubble will ultimatily burst around 150-250bm. Beware.
&gt;&gt;2375910That&#039;s brainlet thinking, think end of 2030. It will be in the trillionsHopefully I have accumulated enough by then I can start developing a Crypto Citadel community, focused on maintaining freedom and simply living free
never ever nocoiner
&gt;&gt;2375871Posts like this are sign we are at top of bubble. Anyone buying now is a literal idiot normie moron
&gt;&gt;2375895&gt;Bitcoin will end when the world endsfixed
verge is diiiiiiiiiiiiiipingto buy or not to buy?
that&#039;s a downtrend honey
MFW bought at 151, sold during the last time it broke 190. Should&#039;ve just taken the money and ran earlier, when it was +200.
Bought at 183AMA.
wtf is happening? .138 atm
&gt;&gt;2372101i bought at 174 and will just hodlyou people expect to double your money every day, this is fucking insane.
if you bought in higher, just hold.that&#039;s nothing to be worried about. if you wanna buy in, now might be a good time
DGB is scaring people into dumping their alts kek.
I bought at 100 and sold at 200.Non, je ne regret rien.
&gt;&gt;2371915Hopefully this downturn could speed up the suicide I&#039;ve delayed for too long now.
&gt;&gt;2371915I was the shit who sold at 138 on bittrex. Should&#039;ve waited for the rebound.I&#039;ll rebuy if it gets low enough, I&#039;m expecting a bottom of 110ish
&gt;&gt;2372285I am the shit who bought those :D
when doeS IT END REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Gonna dip to 100 like RDD, sell imo, minimize losses
&gt;&gt;2372297I&#039;d suggest selling, this is following DGB&#039;s path closely. It&#039;ll get down to 110s eventually and I&#039;ll rebuy. BTC is going up in value again and then people will rebuy into alts considerably soon.
In at 222. These bags are heavy.
&gt;&gt;2372332just hodl, dont sell at a loss pussyeven if it takes a month dont sell at a loss
BTC and ETH are going up, the rest is going down . Just calm the fuck down boyss
It&#039;s still a solid coin with a solid dev. Just hold ffs.
&gt;&gt;2372404&gt;&gt;2372332that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been preaching the whole time!HOLD!
Sold at 136. Actually first time I lost money listening to you. Fuck you.
&gt;&gt;2372690The funny thing is that it went up to 156 just after you sold.How do you feel now?
&gt;&gt;2371915DAMN I should&#039;ve waited until today to load on bags
&gt;&gt;2372690HAHAHA NEW FAG
&gt;&gt;2371915It has been dipping for a week. It is a piece of shit.
&gt;&gt;2372727&gt;&gt;2372788Buying back at 100-110, it has been dippin for a while now
Buy the dip.In at 14 sats, and not selling anytime soon.This coin has potential.
&gt;&gt;2372810Not going to dip anymore.Look at other altsEvery other altcoin is rising again.Why would verge dip?
&gt;&gt;2372793It&#039;s almost next week
&gt;&gt;2372834in at 9! haven&#039;t sold any...
I bought at 14.I don&#039;t want to sell before it maxs out.But it doesn&#039;t seem to have a future
I don&#039;t know why /biz/ has such a hard on with this shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2372837&gt;Not going to dip anymore&gt;Thats what people said at 200
&gt;&gt;2372905&gt;used to be 10 sat&gt;now over 100you newfags don&#039;t even remember how it went up to 17 and then down in May.
&gt;&gt;2372984So what? Even moon coin and bitbean increased in price, I don&#039;t get why so many people are acting like this coin in particular is a super good investment
&gt;&gt;2373000it&#039;s really cheap and it&#039;s going probably going really high.Most 100 sat coins will go 1000-2000+
Whale activity spotted, probably gonna moon like it always does when the whale gets in.
I should have sold at 240 so I can buy back in at 120. Instead of getting 4x gains, I&#039;m gaining only 2x like a total newb.Maybe this shit isn&#039;t for me. Or I need to learn to stop holding all the time at any price.
&gt;&gt;2373069what now. It&#039;s dropping to 100
&gt;&gt;2373017Reddcoin will go to 1000-2000 sats once Redd ID is out
&gt;&gt;2373124Do it like this:Buy coinWait for it do go upWhen you have solid profits, around 30%, 50% depends on the flow, and notice that it isn&#039;t moving much anymore, sell it.Put a buy order at the resistance level/dipDon&#039;t be impatientRepeat
&gt;&gt;2373176Its not, when the whale joins it always goes up.Just look how RDD is stagnating without the whale for several days.RDD and XVG pump in a similar way, probably same whale or group.
What happened to bean?It&#039;s dropping on a downward trend.I bought in yesterday
&gt;&gt;2373195How do I know where is the resistance level?
&gt;&gt;2373250Buy walls?
HERE WE GO!!! WE ARE GOING TO MOON
&gt;&gt;2373250Buy walls and pattern, when the price of your coin &#039;&#039;stabilize&#039;&#039; it will bounce between highs and lows, pay attention to where they are.
&gt;&gt;2372117thisi stacked up to 20k, there will be a mooning eventually and i won&#039;t let it fly byjust like wiht RDD
&gt;&gt;2373358tnx
&gt;&gt;2373397The shit continues to fall like a rock though..
put a buy order before sleep at 160 and bought some more right now 155. Its definitely undervalued even at 200 imho
&gt;&gt;2373017yeah agree, XVG and RDD still have lot room to go. You can actually buy the fuckin dips. When it dips 50% buy, and keep buying. XVG has a target of 50000 sats by the end of this summer. and 20000 by the end of this year. Just look it up. Sounds crazy right? I guess bits sounds crazy to when it sat around 170 sats.
&gt;&gt;2373917BTS. RDD XVG. XVG has the most potential. Just look it all up in the history.
&gt;&gt;2373017Certainly not most, XVG has something behind it at least
&gt;&gt;2373917So you&#039;re saying that I&#039;ll be a millionaire at the summer&#039;s end? That seems decent...
&gt;&gt;2373917&gt;50k sats to 20k satstf are u talking about?
&gt;&gt;2373124same...bought at 63... held at 240 cause im greedy.
IM FREEEE
&gt;&gt;2375943thank you lambo god
&gt;&gt;2375943jesus christ, that posture lmao
Remember when that fat, bald kike said that Borz has a couple of houses, and he will let him stay in one, when he goes to visit in Hungary.Crazy when he didn&#039;t even a &quot;good graphics card&quot; like, 4 months ago when he started talking about taking over that shitcoinhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1793468.msg17893924#msg17893924
Dutchdude, get some help you faggot
20$ soon
&gt;&gt;2375324good post
&gt;smart contract platform&gt;using fucking javascriptnah, its literally pajeet code, even stratis is better with C# even tho its also a pretty dumb meme language
&gt;&gt;2375667C# is a microshit cuck languageOnce the JS sdk comes out this coin will top stratis easily. No matter how much &quot;better&quot; .net is, the tech crowd wants javascript. Node.js. React. Web. They will eat it up.July 2017. This coin will be as big if not bigger than stratshit. This is your last chance to get in sub 150k sat. Buy the dip.http://maxkordek.com/expo.pdf
&gt;venture capital investments during the dot com bubble was USD20 billion a year.&gt;Combined crytomarket cap is over 120 billionHow big would this bubble have to go until you guys stop bag holding?
&gt;muh bubble&gt;living in a world where twitter inc. exists
People were calling this a bubble when btc was $50. Buy and hold until you can retire young
What was the dot com bubble marketcap?
Market cap is not the amount of real dollars people have actually put in the market. It&#039;s the same when some shitty startup raises 20 million for 10% of its shares, that&#039;s 20 million invested but 200 million market cap.
This is a globalised banking system, not an operating systemIt will go well into the trillions, likely helping guide the world into a cyberpunk dystopia
&gt;&gt;2375005your entry price matters, for you guys to make 10x, crytos have to be worth 1.2 trillion, which is worth more than Amazon and Apple combined for a bunch of shitty meme coins you can&#039;t even spend or sell without getting hunted by the FBI
&gt;&gt;2374957dotcom bubble happened when not everyone and their mother was connected to the internet
&gt;&gt;2375049it is also easier to sell and buy dot com stocks than to buy and sell your shit coins
&gt;&gt;23750152.5 trillion
&gt;&gt;2375037Bitcoin, Ethereum, Nexus, Monero, NEM, Bancor and a few othersIn the future these are basically globalised banks, cryptos are like Yughio cards, but better. The elites own many companies outright, and basically collect companies depending on there coding/platform/reception and creation dateHODL till 2020-2030 and stay woke
&gt;&gt;2374957The vast majority of that is in BTC which has been accumulating since fucking 2008 and is speculated separately from all other alt coins.Also, crypto is traded globally, with no restrictions, 24 hours a day.Doesnt take a genius to see we are nowhere, I mean NOWHERE, near a bubble burst. Crypto is more in line with a brand new global industrial revolution, rather than some run-of-the-mill western speculative bubble.
&gt;&gt;2375075thx
yo so to buy crypto coins i need a wallet right ?which are the best wallets/services to buy n hold coins ?
&gt;&gt;2374957http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/why are you just making up figures? 280 companies had a market cap of ~3trillion.We&#039;re 30x away from that.
&gt;&gt;2375037I&#039;ve already made way more than 10x. Been playing with crypto since 2012 and steady holding since 2015. I&#039;ve already earned big. At this point crypto is my job, made more money on this than my STEM degree has ever made me. Just enjoying the ride now.
&gt;&gt;2375037&gt;1.2 trillionIts going to go to that EASILY and much further even still. Im talking hundreds of billions for many individual coins alone, bare minimum- and more than likely much, much higher than that.Crypto is going revolutionize the way we do things on a global scape.You have my permission to fucking screencap this.
bitbeans are going to take me to lamboland
&gt;&gt;2375201I&#039;m invested in bitbean too but I have an issue with the total final circulation being 50 billion. How high do you possibly expect it to moon with a coin that inflated?
&gt;&gt;2375160&gt;Crypto is going revolutionize the way we do things on a global scape.The jews won&#039;t allow that and you know that, they just block exchanges and the crypto will lose 70% of their users, or even more, because not everyone here believes that crypto coins are real money instead of just &quot;nerdy stocks&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2375144congrats, true believers go down with the ship though
&gt;&gt;2375160there is no real valuable technology behind any of the coins and they are too slow to be used for everyday transactions
&gt;&gt;2375034pretty sure it will soar high as USD faith plummets but then someone like china will pull the plug as its a massive threat to the states power.
&gt;&gt;2375241&gt;the jews won&#039;t allow itThey will and we will all get bancor gfs
&gt;&gt;2375135the internet was actually revolutionary, you are just hoarding a bunch of tokens that will become worthless the second Amazoncoin and googlerium comes out.
&gt;&gt;2375268Im at 300+% Gains on 3k investment with no sign of slowing down. You may clean my lambo later.
&gt;&gt;2375244&gt;muh gloom n&#039; doomOk great thanks.
&gt;&gt;2375230I mean I doubt it ever hits a high number like a buck. But it is promising with it being able to quickly move funds and the inperson cash card you can buy.I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a term for it. I doubt it&#039;ll moon but I do seeing it as being useful to quickly move cash from one spot to another.
&gt;&gt;2375294Why would amazon or google make their own shitcoin, as opposed to just using a credits system they fully control?
&gt;&gt;2375311you can clean my real 911 with your tears when you are the dumb sucker holding the bag and was too smart to listen to anyone skeptical.
&gt;&gt;2375352&gt;buys a depreciating asset with the most profitable appreciating asset in the current year&gt;we&#039;re the ones crying
&gt;&gt;2375409&gt;why enjoy things you work for when you can autistically hoard insteadhello /ptg/
&gt;&gt;2375352nice not censoring your license plate, fggtbut i expect you&#039;re just a larp taking pictures of nice cars on the way to your scooter
&gt;&gt;2375352LOLgo back to bed gramps and take your failporche with you. Bespoke lambos are the only cars worth /bizraeli cryptocurrency investors.This forum is exclusively for people willing to make 300% returns daily, not for vanguard/index-fund cucks. Enjoy your 6% yearly returns.
&gt;&gt;2375268&gt;blockchain&gt;smart contracts&gt;several different coins specifically made to tackle micro-transactions quicklyNot sure if I just got baited or you&#039;re legitimately to stupid to recognize the possibilities
&gt;&gt;2375352bread on hood faggot
&gt;&gt;2375352hahahaha20 year old piece of trashHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
&gt;&gt;2375294Ok bro. Thanks for not even attempting to refute my point that you tried to mislead everyone by posting really low numbers.Salty nocoiner stay poer.
&gt;&gt;2375049Right, it happened when everyone and their mother put all of their money into shitty tech stocks because everyone was afraid of missing out on the mad gainz even though they were fucking clueless about the underlying tech. This doesn&#039;t sound familiar at all.
&gt;&gt;2375705This. The reality is that smart contracts are the final step that allows trust-based automation.Automated taxis - running on smart contractsAutomated hotels/tenancy - again on smart contractsFreelancers, ecommerce marketplaces, sales and distribution, the possibilities for trust based automation are endless.
&gt;&gt;2375352&gt;it&#039;s a photo of someone&#039;s carwhat did he mean by this
200btc sell wall just got pulled for Waves. You know what that means, whales have accumulated, tonight it shall pump.Buy now or stay poor
No more pumps sorry guys. Look at Bitcoin and eth, too much going on there to get caught up in alts. It&#039;s a bloodbath of a weekend for the bag holders
Opinions on this? It&#039;s getting shilled hard by some people on twitter
&gt;&gt;2373887It&#039;s good
&gt;&gt;2373887It&#039;s a free dual eth Miner coin
&gt;&gt;2373887Great coin, undervalued
&gt;&gt;2373887Seems good. Undervalued. They are about to finish voting on enabling segwit and modifying their PoS system, should get a bump when the vote finishes and again when they implement.
&gt;screenshot from March 15th 2017How does this make you feel?
&gt;&gt;2373878That&#039;s the exact week I started trading crypto.I wish I had more faith from the beginning. I also wish I had simply held ETH and nothing else. Because I didn&#039;t go all in and decided to trade around, I only tripled my initial investment since then.It feels fucking pathetic. I should have made more but I was too much of a fucking chicken to go all in on this stuff.
&gt;&gt;2373907&gt;I wish I had more faith from the beginning. I also wish I had simply held ETH and nothing else.Doing this right now. Put 60$ into ETH and $20 into a shitcoin which is up 20% and I&#039;ll hold it for another week or two. Play the slow game.
&gt;&gt;2373878haha augur in top 10
&gt;&gt;2373878damn, nem and ripple mooned hard
Nem is actually $0.20 fuuck
&gt;May 2016&gt;Doge and Fedora Coin in top 10https://web.archive.org/web/20160201000000*/http://coinmarketcap.com/if you wanna have a good laugh
&gt;&gt;2373878Sad that I started buying XRP in April instead of March.Fuck you OP I didn&#039;t ask for these feels.
&gt;&gt;2373878I was very depressed,, as I held 800 Litecoin and only 1 Bitcoin back then. I was waiting for the next big spike so I could sell all of my Litecoin.You could say Litecoin outperformed eth for a while, but being a bagholder for many years it feld liberating to get rid of all LTC
Happy I bought ETH and XRP in March.
Will be pretty awesome once the alt bubble pops and all that money flows back to bitcoin.
I cashed out in 2016 and came back in late May 2017.I fucking missed EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING.
guys we&#039;re gonna look back 1 year from now and have the same feelings&quot;the best time to plant a tree...&quot;
&gt;&gt;2373878IT&#039;S A FUCKING BUBBLE AND WE ARE ALL IN DENIAL
&gt;&gt;2374071Or the bubble will pop in 2 weeks and we&#039;ll all be broke
&gt;&gt;2374068ethererum*
Should have bought more ETHshould have bought rippleshould have bought nemi dont like this image, please delete this thread
&gt;&gt;2374102if there actually is a bubble, (there isn&#039;t)the only the pump n dump coins and weird as fuck altcoins will suffer, any coins with actual use will not decrease in value, infact all the money would flow into them
How is it a bubble?? More and more people buying into crypro everyday and there&#039;s only 400 to choose from!It&#039;s not like the internet bubble cos people just created their own website. But people are not creating their own crypto&#039;s.
&gt;&gt;2374146&gt;only 400
everything went as i predicted. but i did not invest
NEM &lt;3Witnessed the rise every morning after waking up. Such a good day.
&gt;&gt;2374146bubble talk is just the usual nocoiner fud, they are just salty their shares only increases 20% a year at best
&gt;&gt;2374055IKTF... Was a LTC bagholder since fucking 2014 or some shit. Wasn&#039;t really paying attention to what was going on in the crypto world so as soon as it went back up about 10-20% after years of bleeding to death, I sold all that shit.&gt;&gt;2374070TFW you buy 200ETH at like $1.50 in 2015 and sell it all a year later for like $6 or whatever the fuck and now you&#039;re praying this motherfucking coin dips so you can finally buy back in.
&gt;&gt;2374196you plan on buying back when it hit rock bottom again? Kinda developed stockholm syndrom syndrome for it
&gt;&gt;2374274I don&#039;t think so, LTC will always be an overpriced POS to me. I&#039;d rather turn the alt portion of my portfolio to more promising, higher growth potential projects.
&gt;&gt;2374102The money you invest should be considered spent by default.
&gt;&gt;2373878DELET THIS
&gt;&gt;2374146&gt;But people are not creating their own crypto&#039;s.Ummmm
I want to post this picture of today, a year from now and know I have made it.I think BTC will be 8k by then.
&gt;&gt;2373878Can u imagine what will happen in 6 months?What lambo will you buy?
&gt;&gt;2374110Can you tell me about a product or a service running on ethereum that justifes 30 billion market cap?
What should I buy right now? Etherium?
makes me wish i bought more than the 200k ripple i got
&gt;&gt;2374652EthLance, Swarm City, Gnosis etc. Smart contracts effectively remove middle men which why Ethereum is where it is today.
&gt;&gt;2374808Wait, how so? Can Ethereum be used as an escrow service? The world I work in DESPERATELY needs a secure trustable escrow middleman service.
zcoin will moon.I warned.srsly.
I know, played around with it a while, might invest heavier into it tonight, this is gonna be gud
What&#039;s it&#039;s movements like. On shit mobile
$70 Zcoin
I bet if you guys actually traded in the real stock market you would crash that shit harder than the boomers telling by how much weakhands there are on here.you guys fall for easiest and simplest shit which is beyond me but once this crypto bubble bursts and goes to the normies you&#039;ll be back to being broke fagsyou guys have no clue how to day trade other than looking at some fake Sell walls and panickinghow do you think real investors have made their millions? they research and then they gamble then diversify their money into shit and hold. learn from the best like Buffet and learn to overcome your weakhands and you&#039;ll be just finehave fun being broke for the rest of your lives though
kys
&gt;&gt;2375798So you advise to buy and hold simply?
&gt;&gt;2375798most of the people who have made lots of money from crypto are not daytraders.When this bull market ends some people on /biz/ will get hurt, but a lot will endure.
&gt;&gt;2375884I advise not to be stupid and throw all your money on one thing like everyone on here trying to get rich quickbuy a bit of the coins you feel the strongest confidence with make sure it isn&#039;t the all time high etc then just hold and forget also don&#039;t check it every minuteIve been swing trading several markets now for a year now and learned enough from mistakes like overcoming my weakhands and did the math to learn that the patient ones get the biggest wormtfw when making real gains and throwing some of it on this shit is a piece of cake being the bubble is no where from a burstIt&#039;s a patient game of holdingeveryone learns from their mistakes though so you guys will have to go through the stage
&gt;bitcoin moons&gt;altcoins down&gt;ether moons&gt;altcoins downwhen will this end
&gt;&gt;2375655Never, as long as there are BTC and ETH based markets
&gt;&gt;2375686total caps up fucking 6 billion though, a lot of extra iscoming in today
&gt;&gt;2375655You were basically offered a seat on a high class rocket ship to the moon and you said &quot;nah i&#039;m good, i&#039;ll take the budget one made by some highs schoolers&quot;
&gt;&gt;2375655Monday, when the normies go back to the stock market.
&gt;&gt;2375717I got 20k in eth though, doesnt hurt to have a few extra seats
&gt;&gt;2375717This. We fucking told him though anon, no, we fucking begged him.
&gt;&gt;2375717High Schoolers that shit in the street.These pajeets can&#039;t even master in-door plumbing, but people here think their going to get rich investing in their shitty coins.
Essentially youre too poor to make monry off this situation in this case. Whats the crypto cap in a year
altcoins are 100% shit and the purest speculation possible, literally going to casino.invest small amounts in alot of them and forget them, if one of them goes 100x it will have been worth it.
What happened to all the Robinhood people?Is crypto currency all that is talked about anymore?
oh robinhoodI spent an entire year with you and you lost me over $1000
&gt;&gt;2375575I never see stock threads here.Which is odd because its still way easier to make money with equities than coins
&gt;&gt;2375575The stock market is run by billionaire jews running algorithms. Cypto has real human traders and isn&#039;t based in old, over inflated petrol dollars
&gt;&gt;2375575Fag
&gt;&gt;2375575Here&#039;s the reason it&#039;s all crypto now. I made 5x your yearly gains in a week. I feel bad for you man because you have a nice bankroll that you could easily double then put half back into robinhood to feel safe again.
All I did was fund it with $5 and buy 10 shares HUSA
&gt;&gt;2375704So do some day traders. I&#039;m really conservative with my investments
&gt;&gt;2375704I&#039;m a dipshit with computers and have no clue how to begin with crypto. I&#039;m sticking with RH right now
&gt;&gt;2375773&gt;Dipshit with computersGet out.
&gt;&gt;2375656But their algorithms still can&#039;t appropriately value a company.&gt;see AMD when it WAS $1
&gt;&gt;2375731that&#039;s the thing though bro I&#039;m not a day trader. I just picked 4 coins that are very reputable and held them for a week. that&#039;s all.&gt;&gt;2375773Well fair enough but you won&#039;t really have an edge trading stocks either if you&#039;re a dipshit with computers.
&gt;&gt;2375773&gt;&gt;2375789You know who else is a dipshit with computers??Warren Buffett
&gt;&gt;2375789I will! Thank you for your support :*)
Use a hardware wallet faggot.Update: I have decompiled the malware that pwned my system. I was hit with a keylogger that stole my passwords.Reminder that it is best to store your shit on a cold storage.
I store it in my refrigerator. Best security
&gt;&gt;2374236And what if pic related happens to your hard wallet?
&gt;&gt;2374264it becomes a soft wallet.
&gt;&gt;2374264store your hard wallet in a safe.
&gt;he wasnt using 2FA
&gt;&gt;2374260I store mine in my freezer
&gt;&gt;2374236how much did you lose?
&gt;&gt;2374398Kek
&gt;&gt;2374236malware can get your shit before you&#039;re able to put it in cold storageHow about getting a computer that doesn&#039;t have malware?Chromebooks don&#039;t have malware.They&#039;re the safest cheapest laptops to use.You just have to make sure you don&#039;t fall for a phising attempt
&gt;&gt;2374264&gt;Thinks the coins are actually stored in the wallet.
&gt;&gt;2374236&gt;I have decompiled the malware that pwned my systemWhy would you lie on the internet to pass good advice?
&gt;&gt;2374498Help me out, please. What&#039;s the point of a hard wallet if you don&#039;t store the coins in them?
&gt;&gt;23744272.7 BTC
&gt;&gt;2374549The coins are stored on the block chain.Hardware wallets generate an industry standard code, BIP 39. It&#039;s a 12 or 24 word seed such as:&gt;moon unveil report amused debate enter exclude audit tattoo knock address furyBIP 44 protocol takes the BIP 39 seed and deterministically derives public and private addresses from it.https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/If you type my example 12 word key in to there it&#039;ll always generate the address 1A7nMaKJtQYXN8wi158M6uHgkhRT1ERpMJ as the root address #0, and 116o933YZFJJXqTLscJn3kKEYJHD4ea6x as #1, and so on.All your hardware wallet does is remember your seed and sign transactions using the private keys derived from it. The computer you connect it to never sees your private key, only the signed transaction message so it&#039;s the only way to spend coins in cold storage. No virus, keylogger, or malware can steal from it. As long as you wrote down your BIP 39 seed or have it memorized, you&#039;ll never lose your private addresses no matter what happens to the device.
&gt;&gt;2374860So is there really any point to a hardware wallet if you can just make a paper wallet?
wouldnt 2FA antagonize keylogging attacks?
&gt;&gt;2375097Yeah the weak link in the chain with paper wallets is that you have to sweep your funds into a potentially compromised computer / smartphone / online wallet in order to spend from them which makes them as vulnerable as a hot wallet. With hardware wallets you can spend from them while the private keys are always cold / never exposed to an internet connected device.
Show us your favorite coins
Ethereum NEOS Bitcoin
How can you trust a coin made by a Russian?I personally won&#039;t buy ETH as I am a principled American. Russia is our enemy!
&gt;&gt;2374564cope
&gt;&gt;2374564He was only russian until 6 years old.For 17+ years of his life he&#039;s been Canadian.
&gt;&gt;2374616&gt;moving to X makes you Ysounds like sweedish logicalso i&#039;m buying more fuck you OP i like the russians
&gt;&gt;2374616OMG he&#039;s been a Russian spy since he was 6. BRB selling all my ETH.
&gt;&gt;2374564Nice b8 ethbro
&gt;&gt;2374564Your racism cause you to miss out on the greatest investment of your lifetime is the most hilarious karma I can imagine.
Well Russia&#039;s Central Bank just announced that it&#039;s developing a cryptocurrency for Russia. If it&#039;s cheap then I&#039;m investing right away. A state sponsored crypto would moon so fast.
&gt;&gt;2374655Russian isn&#039;t a race faggot
&gt;&gt;2374564that&#039;s why I put all my money in Waves
&gt;&gt;2374682russia is literally poorer than many african countries at this point.nobody wants their currency its in the toilet
&gt;&gt;2374564never bet against Russia
&gt;&gt;2374564tfw principles only cost you money
&gt;&gt;2374744That&#039;s the point of its development. Their reasoning is that if they&#039;re one of the first to officially adopt it then they can use it to improve their economy. Remember, China used to be a shithole too, but then they industrialized and became a global superpower. Russia&#039;s economy has the same potential in the future I think.
&gt;&gt;2374564the real question: Is he a normie?
&gt;&gt;2374616Being Canadian is even worse
&gt;Total cryptocurrency market cap: $109bhttp://coinmarketcap.com/charts/&gt;Total circulation of the Singapore dollar, the 33rd biggest currency in the world: $115bhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2214rank.htmlWe have a long way to go, friends.
So we all agree this is pretty much a scam right?
Attilafx has duped us into buying his lomocoin bags
did you research this coin? It&#039;s actually really promising. just hold, noob
&gt;&gt;2375646I trust Attilafx. Will hold until he says dump.
same, this shit isn&#039;t bad
&gt;&gt;2375658i was sold insta pump that was supposed to happen this week and i trusted this informationi was going to pull out of my alt coins and put it into BTC and ETHinstead, i&#039;m down on everything because every coin i&#039;m in is going down while ETH is mooning
&gt;&gt;2375646t. pudding ballssell now.
&gt;&gt;2375688you sound like a stupid noob who doesnt do his researchthe coin is a geo-location reward game coin, think pokemon go for crypto. HOLD IT you stupid noobs
&gt;&gt;2375700i wasn&#039;t going to put 50% of what i own into it if i weren&#039;t sold instant pump dreams
&gt;&gt;2375711&gt;i wasn&#039;t going to put 50% of what i own into it if i weren&#039;t sold instant pump dreamsjust take out half if you&#039;re so nervous, You&#039;ll probably be fine if you hold it for another week or two at most but whatever man, you do you
&gt;&gt;2375711&gt;Chasing instant pumpsThis is why so many people got burned with DGB. The guys that profited bigly got in when DGB was cheap and stagnant
&gt;&gt;2375711no body said instapump or whatever the fuck you just said.Attilafx researches coins and shares his speculations for free.you are a cunt that should fuck off to some PnD group.
&gt;not buying the LISK dipWhy? This coin has a future.http://maxkordek.com/expo.pdf
BUY
About a month ago this board was great. Everybody could join together and shill one coin for an easy 2x profit. We were just genuinely helping each other out, and it worked. Moon mission after moon mission, we were on track to buy lambos in no time. We were essentially collectively pumping and dumping coins.Then came along mooncoin. A lot of people lost a lot of money caused by the whales dumping on us all at once. And then biz collapsed along with mooncoin. Instead of working together, people began selfishly shilling their own shitcoins and trying to dump bags on each other. Instead of helping each other, they began scamming each other. Instead of helping their bizbros makes money, they were making them lose money. And for what? No whale is gonna actually listen to any of the shitty threads on here and buy some shitcoin. The only people who get scammed are the little guys, and the scammers end up gaining nothing.We must stop this. We must return to the glory days and work together. Instead of 100 different coins being shilled by just one person per coin, why dont we have 100 different people shill one coin. Our strength is in numbers, and we must take advantage of that. If we let the whales and jews take advantage of us and watch us fight among each other, they will only grow stronger. We must unite and form the greatest whale of all time, and then we will be the ones laughing. Please anon, for all your fellow bizbrothers, stop shilling shitcoins that will go nowhere, find coins that have the potential to moon (such as ethereum when it was $7), and help us go to the moon together.
Can I vote to start pumping ESPER2?It&#039;s not a hopeless shitcoin, it actually has an active dev community behind it and a lot of people on Twitter are shilling this coin lately to.A lot of smart money is moving into this coin.
I vote for ECC and Espers, both are good coins with potential.
Need a verified group or something...
&gt;&gt;2372605sup anon,Im with you bro. we should create a centralised forum for this and bring the voted ideas back to biz to implement. wat you think
&gt;&gt;2372605Discord rooms have basically taken over and they shill shamelessly; THey make memes and try to practice undue influence; No rules in the wild wild west these days, better get used to it I guess.
how about an actual /biz/ discord that works for good rather than evil. a countershilling thing that makes us money
Espers sounds good actually
Mooncoin is the only shitcoin worth a damn. But nobody is ever going to cooperate. Everyone will continue shilling the coins that they own with the intention of dumping their bags, because they bought an utterly shit coin.MOON is the only one with the potential to grow to 100sat. But you won&#039;t ever stop bickering. And I don&#039;t care. All this means is that you&#039;ll keep getting scammed, and I&#039;ll just have to wait a bit longer to 100x my MOON.
Pump bitbean just once. I won&#039;t ask anything again
&gt;&gt;2372707You mean the encrypted messaging? I approve this idea.
&gt;&gt;2372809Why don&#039;t you just sell your already pumped shitcoin and jump on the next wave? This is why you&#039;re losing money. You bought at ATH? Lesson learned. Sell and move on.
the problems started like you said with mooncoin. Once a million different shitcoins on yoshit started being shilled for pumps everything when to hell... NO MORE YOSHIT PUMPS
&gt;&gt;2372605That&#039;s the nature of the internet: one successful thread and it gets copied until it&#039;s funny as a 9gag post.It&#039;s over. The pumps here became meaningless. Every idiot is trying to sell his very own shitcoins. Accept it. I&#039;m only still here for fun.If you want good investment advice, you have to go back and read whitepapers, check the tech and team behind a coin, and go long-term.
If you haven&#039;t noticed crypto has blown up in the last two weeksETH was $150 like two weeks agoThis board has grown considerably and the car is out of the bag that crypto is godlike and /biz/ is the most fun board on 4chanIt&#039;s the wild west now. Just remember to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH
&gt;&gt;2372856No more yoshit.
&gt;&gt;2372622Definently, i don&#039;t want to see esper to become just a simpel P&amp;D coin but hey, it is a real good undervalued coin that should be higher in value.
&gt;&gt;2372707They actually have a lot of plans up ahead and they have a road map. It&#039;s definitely that has potential to rise.Last time I saw it was at 12 sat, its a real steal for such an early development.
&gt;&gt;2372605You all know the one true coin which could make us all rich
&gt;&gt;2372622Espers as a community seems to be somewhat cohesive. The only downside is the project is done by a smaller team, but that seems the same with every project.
&gt;&gt;2372701https://discord.gg/FtdQVJhere&#039;s one
&gt;&gt;2372844i made profits but got greedy and rebought
at ATH
&gt;&gt;2372605bitbean is a serious coin with a friendly community that will help each other get to the mooon!
I take it you missed the Ark delegate pool then
To anybody wanting to buy ESPERS....DO NOT PURCHASE ON YOBIT. it&#039;s an old fork. I got &#039;em on novaexchange.
&gt;&gt;2374779sorry. chain, not fork
&gt;&gt;2372622Someone redpill me on the ESP2 roadmap. Does all of this stuff actually have potential? What are the advantages of website hosting on the blockchain?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1434700.0
Buy the dip now. Printing money at it(s finest
&gt;&gt;2368149High risk, small reward
bought at 1500 allready 1620 again. Hurry. To the moon.
&gt;&gt;2368171No way. Whales love this coin. Its like fisshin
&gt;buy $10 worth of DGB a few days ago&gt;decide to sell tonight because fuck it there are better things to put it into&gt;put up sell&gt;check back in 20 minutes&gt;still hasn&#039;t soldlmao I guess I&#039;m hodling
Wasn&#039;t this coin supposed to be making money about this time because minecraft server tomorrow?
&gt;&gt;2368631lolno
Where should I put my buy orders for the night time dips?
I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d call this a dip lol. More like a catastrophic collapse
I&#039;ll probably buy it when it goes below 1000 sats lmao
&gt;&gt;2368640Lol. Jesus. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t buy in on that shill then. Digifags getfukt.
&gt;&gt;2368631Do you think one private minecraft server with no official affiliation to anything justifies a coin to be worth 400m market cap?
&gt;&gt;2368660Yes. I bet you haven&#039;t even played Minecraft before.
If you look at the order books, its whale manipulation.They drive prices down and weak hands sell and whales accumulate more. Then when it rises normally whales make tons of money
&gt;&gt;2368671&gt;muh whalesApparently people still don&#039;t understand the concept of BUY THE FUCKING RUMOR, SELL THE FUCKING NEWS! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!I could see this collapse a week previous. I continuously warned everyone, but they kept going on about &quot;muh shills&quot; and &quot;muh moon&quot;.
People panic sold. This is how you make money. It had strong support between 1800-1900.I bought it at the lowest 1500.
&gt;&gt;2368667I haven&#039;t actually cuz I&#039;m not a faggot and I enjoy getting laid.
&gt;&gt;2368686What news friend?You spout stock trading 101 tips but have nothing to back it up...The results aren&#039;t revealed until july
&gt;&gt;2368686&gt;BUY THE FUCKING RUMOR, SELL THE FUCKING NEWS!Elaborate
&gt;&gt;2368699&gt;3DPD even onceLmaoing at your lyfe 4reel.
&gt;&gt;2368712The rumor was the upcoming CITI conference, hence the 500 sat price pump in the days previous to the event. I bought a week ago.The news was the conference itself and everyone like me got out before it tanked.Then if you&#039;re a competent investor you buy and sell the dip. I&#039;ve already made 1BTC just off buying and selling this dip, and you should be watching it too for price deviations. Look at the ETH and XVG charts for comparison of what this period should have in store.
&gt;&gt;2368713Is there something wrong with preferring to shoot guns for fun, go to the bar with your buds, and chase girls? Is that really so bad? I don&#039;t even own a game console unless you count a laptop from 2012 and a smartphone.
&gt;&gt;2368734Any good online resources about reading market trends and tips and things to look out for etc but more focused around crypto instead of general stocks and shit?Im still early on reading various books but no real luck on indepth texts focusing or with a crypto emphasis
&gt;&gt;2368694&gt;People panic sold. This is how you make money. It had strong support between 1800-1900.&gt;I bought it at the lowest 1500.I&#039;m not touching it until 600-1000 sat or it clearly reverses it&#039;s downward trend.
&gt;&gt;2368738Get off my board normie.
1625 - will go back to 18-1900 easely
LMAO ITS A FUCKING SINKING SHIPhave fun holding those bags retards
&gt;&gt;2368749They are just an exaggerated version of tech stocks. Only difference is the smaller values make it easier for large players to manipulate the market and it&#039;s filled with inexperienced traders that panic faster than people who own shares.
&gt;&gt;2368734&gt;sell the dipAre you listening to yourself? Are you drunk?I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t be as special as you are. Forgive my common sense and respect my right to think you&#039;re a faggot. Lmao. I&#039;m gonna crack a beer and stand by to make fun of you.
&gt;&gt;2368749No honestly the two most important things are chart time and an intensive university level course on trading where you&#039;ll learn technical analysis, various market holds, how to effectively arbitrage, etc ...You can find Yale/Harvard/Stanford/MIT video lectures on the second, whereas with the first you just need experience. Try to recognize patterns, draw lots of lines on the charts, and look where those lines intersect.
&gt;&gt;2368768&gt;&gt;2368786Where do you honestly see DGB going in the future? Back up or this is a done deal.My guess is back up.
&gt;&gt;2368770I said buy and sell the dip, Tyrone. &quot;Dip&quot; as in this period where it&#039;s violently fluctuating. Enjoy being poor though.
Or you could just develop an understanding of economics, statistical data analysis, and read news regarding your investments. It&#039;s not fucking hard.
1650 allready n00bs
&gt;&gt;2368791I think it is going up right now, but there&#039;s a lot of uncertainty too. I could easily see it hitting a floor of 1400 over the next 1.5 days.
&gt;&gt;2368795Lol. I&#039;m not even poor. I like you. Grade 1 Autist. Enjoy your piles of money my friend. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re wealthy AF. Please, tell me, what color is your lambo xD
WHO ELSE FELL FOR THE DIGIMON PUMP?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2375154Have a bit of patience you fuck. This drop is shaking out the weak hands. There is still a lot of actual events taking place in DGB universe.
I bought at 50 sats still have it in my wallet. Idc I still can cash out and make over 700%
Thats pretty cool right? :)
why is ark so good?what makes it good?why are you all shilling it constantly?is the idea innovative? does it work? do the devs have good reputation? are they active? what is the roadmap?
&gt;&gt;2375707You can answer all of these yourself within 5 minutes
&gt;&gt;2375707ARK is literally all the rage rn in /biz/Stop being a lazy piece of shit and get in on the future money maker.
What are the signs that something is about to get pumped? How do I get in on something like this when it just started to go up?
price is making it&#039;s way down toward that old 700 sat peak, maybe cheap if it isn&#039;t a scam? but it is right? if i put an order in there i&#039;ll be the eternal bag man wont i goys?
Be it a scam or not, the price is heavily manipulated by those who got early in the train. And there&#039;s a fucking lot of people who got there early. Proceed with caution.
&gt;&gt;2372026Very scammy, constant moving targets of tech and based off an older scamcoindevs dropped their bags pretty successfully i suppose
&gt;&gt;2372026Of course its a fucking scam... what is wrong with you retards continually asking if this is a scam or not... It obviously fucking is!
&gt;&gt;2372026&gt;&gt;2372134&gt;&gt;2372377&gt;&gt;2372444Samefag, probably dutchboi
&gt;&gt;2372026Just look at the fucking &#039;80s design logo and then short the shit out of this trash
&gt;&gt;2372444Why are there anons hodling millions of it still?
&gt;&gt;2372026it&#039;s a pnd shitcoin; made me a pretty penny but that&#039;s about itdo not attach yourself emotionally to any shitcoin

&gt;&gt;2372499Ye i&#039;ll play dutchboi todayXBY is still a fucking scamEveryone gonna get dumped onDont come back to biz crying when you get assfucked by CCRevdog and BorzyDog
&gt;you are a bunch of shills!Almost the exact same answer you gave in reddit for someone calling out your bullshit, you gave it in another thread too.You are the same duchfag.Let us take the risks and decide what to do with our own money.I already made 3x gains (I have now over a bitcoin) with XBY, but I&#039;m aware I can go to sleep and see all my gains go down 50% in the morning, and I&#039;m OK with that.You lost your static node, get over it. Just invest again and join us or just do your business and stop being an asshole
fuck off dutchboy you are a loser
&gt;price drops&gt;therefore it&#039;s a scamokay
I will never forgive myself. Darkness is all I see before me. Hope I can buy some nice rope.

Have y&#039;all noticed that the greater ETH gains happen during the weekends, when the stock market is closed?
All the forex old fucks looking to get into the crypto cyber space
&gt;&gt;2375716But the old fucks are too old to understand the ecosystem so they just throw money at BTC and ETH.
thanks to the anon who recommended 1broker the other day, I sleep better now

Is buying real estate in a small town that slowly growing a good idea?
&gt;&gt;2375607if you also plan to rent it out or live in it, yes
thankyouvitalik
&gt;&gt;2374217
the ride never ends
&gt;yfw you got out of the YOshit 1 sat game before it became oversaturated and full of bagholdersMade out with a clean 2K from just $50KIDS, STAR, and BON.Now all the missions on Yoshit are just full of self defeating discords.
nice anon,but yobit is fucking cancer.Stop mentioning it.
&gt;&gt;2375131&gt;held some bags from a pnd&gt;mfw I incited another pump and sold at a slight profit and passed on my bagsD E V I L I S H
where&#039;s a legit place to buy obscure alts
&gt;&gt;2375164funny thing is the 1 sat pump idea would have worked as a viable means of some quick organized gains, but then the 19 /biz/ discords all banded to each go in and find one that wasn&#039;t taken and then attempt to P&amp;D endlessly after KIDS got 10x in just 12 hours.Now every single 1 sat mission get dumpped almost instantly the second it gets to 3-4 sat making it a bagholding competition to see who can get out first.Now /biz/ has 10+ threads at all time of people trying to shill their Sub-10 sat coins attempting to push for another mission, but its already over.The yobit chat and the discords already betray them. I&#039;m just glad I got out with a hefty profit and before I got stuck with bags.
why are you not hopping on this rocketship anon?
&gt;&gt;2374385stop spamming your shitty yobit coin alreadyhow much are they paying you
&gt;buy the dip
wait until its 2-4 sat to buy some of this shit coins
&gt;&gt;2374431That&#039;s not gonna happen.
&gt;&gt;2374385Already gone allin at ATH. Help me to Lamboland, don&#039;t leave me with heavy bags!If not, I guess I got a new use for my old RaspberryPi, it will going to stake on it 24/7.
&gt;&gt;2374385Lite doge is the future currency for microtransactions. I estimate the market cap will hit around $600m by the end of this year. That&#039;s a gain of 200x its current level. This is a coin that is impossible to go wrong with.
just happened to me with GRC
wtf my greentext disappeared&gt;try to buy at .00002831&gt;accidentally put in order at .0003831&gt;goes through immediately at ATH&gt;price plumits like i expected it to
Hey /biz/, I left this shillhole but I have returned to do you all a favor.Stop buying pajeetcoins and look at this. The first coin I bought was GRC. It has experienced steady and reliable growth. No turbulent ups and downs. It runs on a proven Proof Of Research called BOINC. As of yesterday it had a market cap of 25 million and a volume of $100kToday that market cap is at $33 million and has gone up by one million more dollars as I typed this. The volume is also now $1 million dollars. I can&#039;t promise anything spectacular with this coin, but if you want a stable hold with reliable gains I would buy Gridcoin. Dump your DGB and STRAT and invest in a sleeping giant guys.
&gt;&gt;2375116&gt;I left this shillhole but I have returned to do you all a favor&gt;*SHILLS ALL OVER THE BOARD*
&gt;&gt;2375116I&#039;m on it OPThis one is gonna pump hard
but your discord group tried to start shilling this yesterday and were called outwatch for gridcoin threads to appear soon
&gt;&gt;2375134Yes, I&#039;m shilling. But I&#039;m telling you guys about a reliable coin that isn&#039;t a cancerous scam. I lost a bit of money from the PND&#039;s on here and I wanted to advertise something safer. Gridcoin is using a proven 20 year-old research system for mining, and is honestly a better idea than Golem with more room to grow. You don&#039;t hear me shouting &quot;TO THE MOON&quot; on this one.
&gt;&gt;2375163lol I&#039;m in a discord group but it&#039;s certainly not PNDI know nobody trusts anyone on this board, and with good reason. I&#039;m not trying to sell get-rich-quick tickets here, just a stable investment that makes it easy for weak-handers that has consistent growth.
&gt;get in yesterday at 2320&gt;see +3k todayOnly bad thing is I&#039;m poor and have 200 GRC
&gt;&gt;2375425I got in at 1960 with just 300 GRC and it&#039;s been the most consistent earner in my portfolio. Just be patient brother.
Okay guy, my $100 just made it to YobitTime for trading shitcoin, what&#039;s getting pumped today?
stratis is low
um mom
&gt;&gt;2373715BOMB is getting pumped, it&#039;s gaining traction
&gt;&gt;2373715Buy at 1sat, set a sell order at 2. If you&#039;re not in the first BTC&#039;s worth of sell orders then kys, you&#039;re not gonna make a profit. The end.
&gt;&gt;2373780If it&#039;s a PnD and they tell you about it, they&#039;re trying to dump it on you. Idiot.
buy ESP, its only 1 sat right now.
&gt;&gt;2373715Stratis is low right now.Put your money in and have fun. Just check back next week and see how much you&#039;ve earned.
&gt;&gt;2373715just checked out Yobit,PAJEET-FUCKING-CENTRALcareful anon.
&gt;&gt;2373780Don&#039;t listen to this. Stay out of that shit. The order book alone tells you they&#039;re looking for dumb fucks to dump their shitcoin on
&gt;&gt;2374090STFU,that&#039;s not ESP2, that&#039;s the old abandoned chain. The ESP dev has told ybit many times to stop this shit
fuck

What&#039;chya know about Bstar?
Why are retards saying BTC is going to be worth $100,000-$1,000,000 one day? How the fuck would this even be possible?21,000,000 x 1,000,000 = 21,000,000,000,000The entire world would have to be using fucking BITCOIN for this to be a reality, or even close to it, fucking half and we need about 10 trillion USD worth market cap, or half of the entire fucking population.
lolgold (the fucking metal that hasn&#039;t been relevant for 100+ years) has a 7 trillion dollar market capyou vastly underestimate the amount of wealth in the world
if blatant shilling threads were banned on sight by a relatively active janitor/mod community, this board&#039;s quality would moon harder than any fucking faggot p&amp;d shitcoin scam everprove me wrong
have you bought mooncoin yet?
&gt;&gt;2373020if we ban TALKING ABOUT COINS, this board would be empty, do you want to ban ads for other things on 4chan too? coke etc
&gt;&gt;2373020&gt;t. bag holder
Shilling is a 100% subjective time termIn my view your post is shilling and should be deleted / censoredYou sound like a butthurt bagholder
This is a libertarian board.Anyone who partakes in a scam, has done so voluntarily.
All we need is a general for these shit coins.20 different DGB threads for 2 months straight is beyond retarded.
&gt;&gt;2373348This guy gets it
&gt;&gt;2373020&gt;prove me wrongI can&#039;t, I was just about to make a similar thread.
KIDScoin is amazing, yoi should buy it now
&gt;&gt;2373336shilling which coin exactly you massive autistic retard?
&gt;&gt;2373020You&#039;re right. This way less newbies would also fall for scams, since now it&#039;s just chaotic when you try to look for starter advice for what to invest in.
&gt;&gt;2373020&gt;X IS MOONING, BUY NOW&gt;YOU MISSED X,Y,Z, DON&#039;T MISS WThese threads need to be deleted&gt;&gt;2373348agreed, one thread per coin would be perfect
Honestly we just need a /csg/ thread (coin shill general), kinda like what happened with all the daytrading/penny stock threads got consolidated to the robbin hood threads.
&gt;&gt;2373348I agree it would be better to concentrate in generals because1 as it is now discussions/information are thread out so thin in so many different low value threads.2 other interesting threads are kill extremely quickly because they are bumped off by threads which are basically redundant duplicates and this means there are fewer other types of interesting threads.But unfortunately I doubt anything will be done because it seems this board is doing exactly what it was intended to do, namely be a containment board.
Enact a ban on making threads about coins which are exclusively listed on Yobit. 100% of Yobit exclusives are scams, P&amp;Ds and dead coins.
Buy the dip or cry later
&gt;&gt;2371685is it okay NOT to be the dip AND NOT to cry? Because honestly currently I don&#039;t feel like either buying OR crying, independently from the fact whether I buy or not
&gt;&gt;2371685some anon shilled this yesterday already13% up since thenthanks
&gt;&gt;2371768Sure if you dont like money
Happening now
take off
&gt;&gt;2371685$70 Zcoin be prepared for a Lambo
wot dip mate?
&gt;&gt;2375370It was at 0.0027 when i posted
1337 coin has been blowing up on cryptopia and yobit. If you have them nows a good time to start flipping for a profit or possibly to buy and profit more. The wallets are in maintenance due to a swap to some w00t coin.going for 15-17sats on both exchanges and has hit 21sats already today...wasn&#039;t long ago it didn&#039;t even have its own BTC market on cryptopia it was so cheap
buy qrl before dip is gone!!!!!!!
not buying your bags, kid.
&gt;&gt;2375039&gt;crappleshitterKeep your garbage, faglord.
suit yourself, thats why you&#039;re poorim saying buy now sell 30k
&gt;&gt;2375078&gt;&gt;2375056keeps rising you fag nerdsbeutiful wall will be removed asap it reaches it, so prepare for ultra pump
Which is the better crypto to invest right now ?
&gt;&gt;2375264ARK
&gt;&gt;2375269hodling ark but&#039;s it&#039;s a shaky time to buy what with the manipulation
Stratis has more long term potential. Lisk will fade into irrelevancy once ark takes over. Stratis.
&gt;&gt;2375312This. $strat will grow massively over the next 6 months.
&gt;&gt;2375264RISE
&gt;&gt;2375264&gt;tfw no 10/10 aryan gf to share my beans with
Fuckity fuck fuck shit fuck. I had 1000 LSK at $0.40 and sold at $0.60. Reeeeeeeeeee!
&gt;&gt;2375264list short term and stratis longtermeth for both short and longterm
i honestly prefer Lisk just on the basis that C# is shit and JS is taking over everything, that being said i hodl both long term.
Redpill me on batI can still sell without loss
If the Brave browser is successful BAT is gonna be huge, if it isn&#039;t it will be shit.
People will not use their browser. Their mobile app won&#039;t amount to shit. As far as I know, the option isn&#039;t even turned on by default.The project will simply fail.Having said that, I think you should wait a bit before you get out. I think it&#039;ll rise.
&gt;&gt;2373807it&#039;s a chrome plugin too faggot
&gt;&gt;2373812Nobody will install it. If you think otherwise.. it&#039;s not my money.
&gt;&gt;2373809Yeah, and we just let google and Firefox just keep harvesting our data. Before you fuckign know it they&#039;ll ask if they can take our kidney out next tuesday while we&#039;re at the doctors.
If you invest in bat you should download brave to support it
&gt;&gt;2373825It will work, BAT as a technology is fucking needed. Advertisers are losing asstons by having to pay hundreds of shitty sites independently. Even google ad&#039;s are hit or miss the proper power owner should be in the browser based upon what it considers is your target.
&gt;&gt;2373782you will be fine, there is a lot of buy pressure on this, all trying to get the cheapest price.O)n the other hand you have ICO whales dumping, because its one thing to hold 1 bitcoin worth to 10x gains, but another to hold 100 bitcoin worth that long.So they are content with selling early to cover their investment and some change.The fact it hasnt rapidly crashed means it will grow long term.
&gt;&gt;2373825
&gt;&gt;2373809Why would someone activate the plugin if 90% of users have an ad blocker ? Is there something I&#039;m missing here ?
&gt;&gt;2373863
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlcnOr81lPcHe&#039;s spoken about the idea. Now its slowly being built.
&gt;&gt;2373875
&gt;&gt;2373857Yeah, right.Its value WILL go up, but it&#039;ll take time. In that time you could be making actual gains.
&gt;come back to /biz/ after months&gt;everything is bitcoin, ETH, DGB or whatever the fuckthe fuck is going on here?
&gt;&gt;2371589The future is going on, anon. The future.
&gt;&gt;2371589we are in nasty bubble right now
&gt;&gt;2371684so not a good time to get in?I was actually looking for tips on ETFs.. you know the kind of advise you used to get on /biz/
&gt;&gt;2371684Yup. Ignore all this bitcoin shit. It&#039;s all a ponzi sceme. I lost all my money investing in ETH and bitcoin.Stay away from hereOr go on Yobit.
&gt;&gt;2371699Which ETFs were u looking at?
&gt;&gt;2371757nothing in particular, I was looking for tips on which ETF to buy. first time I&#039;m investing.
&gt;&gt;2371589EFTs, meh
&gt;&gt;2371705Not quite sure how you lost money with Eth and BTC unless you bought high, got scared by a slight drop and sold at a loss, in which case thats a you problem, not a bitcoin problem.
&gt;&gt;2371886So the first graph is showing a bubble forming due to shit companies being given ridiculous valuations. The second graph shows a recovery from one the worst crashes in history. Anything that follows an index does tend to outperform most stock picking in the long run, whether it be done by yourself, or some &#039;analyst&#039;.
&gt;&gt;2371589You are missing out on the opportunity of your life.
&gt;&gt;2372090I might invest 10 euros but otherwise this feels like people jewing each other
&gt;&gt;2372190No, you&#039;re correct that&#039;s exactly what this is. Honestly just a month back you&#039;d still find some helpful people, whom if you&#039;d listen to you could get some profit, today though it&#039;s pretty much 100% scammers here on this board trying to offload their bags onto you.
&gt;&gt;2372190&gt;10Put a 1000 on eth or don&#039;t bother
&gt;&gt;2371589Everyone else left. I don&#039;t know where all of the cryptoshills came from.&gt;&gt;2371705&gt;ponzi scemeI wish people would learn what a ponzi scheme is.
It&#039;s getting worse now that the amerifats are getting online.why don&#039;t mods clean this shit.
&gt;&gt;2371589You want help? Go here https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_startedYou want a shoulder to cry on? /r/personalfinanceYou want to jerk off over index funds? /r/financialindependenceYou want to learn about shit? http://www.investopedia.com/You want crypto shitposts? Then you&#039;ve come to the right place.
&gt;&gt;2372271&gt;Everyone else left.where did they go
&gt;&gt;2372271&gt;I wish people would learn what a ponzi scheme is.I know what a ponzi scheme is and crypto fits the bill perfectly. In fact the very definition of it is exactly what 90% of the thread son Biz are currently about&gt;a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.
&gt;&gt;2371705How the fuck did you lose money on either? I want an explanation. You literally just had to hold it
&gt;&gt;2371699Still early as fuck Anon find some non-shit coins and just invest as much as you can ,
Quick, someone tell all these companies that Ethereum is a worthless ponzi scheme. Funny that multi billion dollar corporations have been duped, but anons here are too smart to fall for that shit.http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/ethereum-jpmorgan-microsoft-alliance/
&gt;&gt;2371589Basically the board got filled with pajeets and everybody is shilling their own coin.
&gt;&gt;2371705&gt;I lost all my money investing in ETH and bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2371705
&gt;&gt;2372931okay but how do I buy ETH?
&gt;&gt;2374056Simple. Buy the ETF for it. :^)
&gt;/biz/&gt;almost all threads is shilling about memecoins&gt;no threads about stocks, bonds, companieshaven&#039;t been here for 4 months , wtf happened
&gt;&gt;2371705&gt;Yup. Ignore all this bitcoin shit. It&#039;s all a ponzi sceme. I lost all my money investing in ETH and bitcoin.FUCKING HOW?
&gt;&gt;2374630gains in excess of 100000% happened.
&gt;&gt;2374747how long till this bubble bursts ? or at least gets a decent price correction ?
&gt;&gt;2374761&gt;how long till this bubble bursts ? or at least gets a decent price correction ?About 10-15 years. In the meantime, everyone here can get in on coins at relatively cheap, sell them once normies enter the market and crash it, then retire with a lambo and a mansion.
any good tutorials/guides on how to buy this shit ? Or like crypto wallet/service recommendation ?If it lasts even for another 3-5 years that&#039;d be nice.
&gt;&gt;2374909this. the ETH hike got me interested. Willing to lose $300 if that means I might be an early adaptor to some technologal thingy magingy.
&gt;&gt;2373575Sounds like RDD and ARK rn.

BUY THE DIP
What dip
When will you wake up and realize that crypto is this generation&#039;s plantation?
&gt;&gt;2374665mfw there are STILL nocoiners in 2017
&gt;&gt;2374597implying its a dip and not bears.
&gt;&gt;2375027they are one in the same friendobears in a bull market cause dips
&gt;&gt;2375113implying its a bull market
&gt;&gt;2375389implying it isn&#039;t
&gt;&gt;2375389not for you evidently
&gt;LAST&gt;FUCKING&gt;CHANCE&gt;FAGGOTS
fucking shit they&#039;re getting faster, GET IN MEN
what should you do if a whale throws up a buy wall like this? buy like mad or sell like mad?
you fucks are useless
Those aren&#039;t walls, dumbass
&gt;&gt;2375371then what am i looking at here
&gt;&gt;2375393thats the dip faggotget in on it
&gt;&gt;2375478This. Already loaded more myself
&gt;&gt;2374997that&#039;s just supportif it&#039;s one guy, expect dipif it&#039;s several, expect increase
Figured I&#039;d post this before I went out today to do some shit.I started trading a bit over a month ago with next to fuckall money or knowledge and then I listened to you when you told me to go all in on DGB at about 60sat.Was about to be fired from my job because I didnt have a car, family and friends all thought I was throwing what little I had away and this was all a scam. The only ones who stood by me was my girl (and even she had her doubts)... and of course you /biz/raelis. So thank you... you changed this one poorfag&#039;s life for the better and I cant thank you enough. You didnt just show me what to do, you TAUGHT me how this all works and that skill is invaluable.I still hodl DGB because I know this coin is just getting started and these dips are fuckin nothing.
&gt;&gt;2373045and yes, I know its not a lambo but it is a start and a car that saved my shitty day job and made my life betterAlso a special fuck you to all you nocoiners, fuders, &quot;muh cant cash out&quot; &#039;s, &quot;Its a bubble&quot; &#039;ers and pump groups who scared the shit out of me when I had just started and put money in the wrong stuff.
&gt;&gt;2373045best shill attempt i&#039;ve seen in a while. nice job
and my dad works in nintendonice pasta ;)
&gt;&gt;2373071this
&gt;&gt;2373045&gt;Old second hand model of a low-tier Audi.
thats a shit car whats wrong with you
Nice VW. My nephew also got his with the last summer job money he got!
Get out of my garage, OP.
&gt;&gt;2373071/THREAD
&gt;&gt;2373071Certainly a creative one.
&gt;&gt;2373068anon good work but why the fuck did you buy a car with your hodlings? you didnt fucking spend them all did you?&gt;?
&gt;&gt;2373091as I said. I&#039;m poor. Didnt even have a car before this so worth my time&gt;&gt;2373072okay fuckboy. find this image anywhere else on the internet. You cant because I took it this morning.&gt;&gt;2373071Really not a shill... DGB was a fucking godsend for me
&gt;&gt;2373128of course not. I sold near peaks and bought back in during the dips and accumulated from there on out. I put more of my life savings in before it went to 2k sat and it worked out perfectly.I needed this car for my job and so I can be a wagecuck long enough to do this shit full time and live a comfy life
&gt;&gt;2373045Fellow poorfag. We made it OP. We really made it.
&gt;Buying depreciating assetsBut really, I&#039;m happy for you dude.We&#039;re all gonna make it.
dude takes picture of parents car. BUY DGB
&gt;Uses daddy&#039;s car to shill a shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2373045Im happy for you anon, posts like those keep me going. I really hope life turns out well for you. Best of luck, we&#039;re all gonna make it!
&gt;&gt;2373045&gt;selling his valuable crypto for a depreciating assetif true, godspeed senpai
Great to hear! All the best OP
&gt;&gt;2373045I&#039;m having a hard time believing this isn&#039;t an elaborate DGB shill. Post your MV1 form, otherwise fuck off.
Nice job OP, also smart to buy a cheap car so you can wagecuck a bit longer. Normalfags won&#039;t understand you just saying you&#039;re going to just trade shitcoins until you cash out millions so a cheap car to get back and forth to wagecuck is a smart purchase.
&gt;&gt;2373949dude says he had no car before. if this isn&#039;t all a buncha LARP faggotry, having a car will boost his self confidence and allow him more freedom.but he&#039;s probably a fat 16 year old weaboo faggot living with parents and carrying DGB bags he bought at ATH
felt really emotional until you shilled dgb, fuck you
&gt;&gt;2373129&gt;as I said. I&#039;m poor. Didnt even have a car before this so worth my timeIf you are poor you should&#039;ve used that 34.5k on dividend paying stocks so you keep getting passive income each month.&gt;using your gains to pay for a shitty second hand carstay poor faggot.
&gt;&gt;2374076&gt;thinks OP spent 34.5k on that carHe probably only spent $5k or so. Which is worth it as it lets him keep his job.
&gt;&gt;2373045&gt;&gt;2373068Well done, OP. Next step; improve your handwriting.
&gt;&gt;2373170ok well enjoy the fucking car but no more spending money on bullshit until you&#039;ve made it anon
&gt;&gt;2373045Godspeed, anon.
hey /biz/ how do i buy coins ? dont want to stay a nocoinerso i need a crypto wallet right ? which wallets/services are the best ?
This is actually quite nice to see, good job anon.+ what car is that? looks like a bmw or audi
&gt;&gt;2373045You bought a new car?? Is that a Chrysler 200? You could have gotten a slightly used one for at least 5k less. Keep hanging around /biz/, you might actually learn some real life things.
Cashing out at the begining of the bubble, you dun goofed.Also buying a depreciating asset, you doing it wrong.
&gt;&gt;2375173depends what coins, lurk for a while
&gt;&gt;2375440I would have bought a mining rig instead of a car...
Guys, should I keep my bulk of ETH on Coinbase with Google authenticator, or the MEW web wallet? Which is safer?
&gt;&gt;2375036paper wallet bitch
&gt;&gt;2375128These are 100% safe? Coins can&#039;t get lost being transferred to and from this thing? Is it safer than google authenticated Coinbase?Not mine btw.
keep half on both. never put all your shekels in one prison pocket.
&gt;&gt;2375138Unlike bitcoin, eth doesn&#039;t need change addresses, it just keeps your coins in the same private key even if you transfer some of them. So yeah it&#039;d be pretty safe.But my personal preference is to use dice to create the seed, since it&#039;s possible that the paper wallet software creates private keys deterministically and then the developer can sweep all the wallets later.
&gt;&gt;2375172Think I should do it now? Is it really as simple as just printing out the above image and saving the JSON file on the desktop? I have a Nano Ledger arriving next month but I&#039;m still kinda nervous in the meantime.
&gt;&gt;2375172Vitapak would never sweep your wallet goy. How dare you?!
&gt;&gt;2375036mist wallet
&gt;&gt;2375308that shit takes years to load if you&#039;re on an HDD.
Total newfag here.I&#039;ve been buying and spending bitcoin for years, but is it worth converting at least half of my bitcoin into ethereum? Is ethereum&#039;s network truly fast enough to support micro transactions?It seems like when bitcoin goes up, it shoots way up, yet ethereum takes a much slower trail upwards.What&#039;s the word??
It also seems like both currencies shoot up every time a country goes into turmoil. Supposedly Finland is having issues at home. Is there reasonable precedence to this observation?
&gt;&gt;2375227no, unless you dont mind waiting 10mins for your payment to get processed just to buy your groceries lmao
&gt;&gt;2375270Obviously, with each economic wobble and a continual growth in poverty I&#039;d say generally there&#039;s not a lot of collective faith behind our banking system, or our societies in generalPeople are throwing money at what is described as the future, everything which reaffirms why they need to invest in the future (Wars, economic wobbles/collapses, political /class warface ) etc etcyesu rite
&gt;&gt;2375227Best currency for microtransactions is lite doge. But no one here seems to realize that yet.
Does blocknet have any future?The market is dead.Should I invest in Monero or Waves instead?
&gt;&gt;2374010Accumulation phase faggot. I do recommend getting in on WAVES as well though. Both BLOCK &amp; WAVES has served me well.
Blocknet sits around a $30M market cap currentlyBlock has $500M+ potential
D-don&#039;t worry guys, it&#039;s a long-term. 1$ at the end of the year. I promise
Ask yourself a question, no other coins have the amount of FUD threads made than DGB. Why?
&gt;&gt;2375205Because you sharpie poopers won&#039;t stop shilling up our board.
&gt;&gt;2375205ETH alone had 20 times more, have some of your own shitty memes so you can keep living in denial
&gt;&gt;2375205have you seen the xby threads?
&gt;&gt;2375180Holy shit shut up nigger these threads aren&#039;t funny anymore. And no, I sold this myself yesterday. Now go do something more productive with your life.
&gt;&gt;2375384&gt;He sold most promising currency in the cryptoworldWill you commit suicide when DGB will hit 5$?
/biz/, do you think financially it would be a good idea to try and learn some coding/programming? From what muhdad has told me, they can make around $48,000 a year, which sounds great to me.Pic unrelated.
Anyone else here tumbling down with no end in sight? Who else got manipulated by the shills? Come and be the biggest loser.
Thanks ETH
Dude. LISTEN TO ME:STOP listening to /biz/. Don&#039;t trust them. EVER. EVEN ME.You got absolutely ripped off. Do your own research and stop relying on others.
&gt;the secret coin the HODL spammers don&#039;t want you to find out aboutIf only I had sold...
&gt;&gt;2374824My biggest loss is on this coin, still hodling but God damn where did it go so wrong
&gt;&gt;2374824Please don&#039;t go there
I cut my losses on that shit a while ago. At this point you may as well keep hodling.
I doubled down after it fell 50%, then it fell 50% again lol, should I double down here?
could&#039;ve sold at 50% profit but instead i was too greedy and i&#039;m still holding
&gt;&gt;2374892you should quadruple down now, go big or go home
&gt;an exchange where you NEED to buy their POS coin to trade&gt;not a scamchoose one
&gt;&gt;2374877&gt;At this point you may as well keep hodling.Yeah, now.&gt;&gt;2374892haha same. fell 50% to 5000, hovered around there, thought it was the bottom of the dip, lolnope 2500 a few days later

Jesus chrst ETH is going to Pluto!Thank FUCK I didn&#039;t sell.
&gt;&gt;2374965MFW I sold for Redd when it was 114 and Verge when it was 200Heaviest bags I have ever held and dumbest move I have ever made
&gt;&gt;2375114Oh i am laffin anon sorry
&gt;&gt;2375114&gt;Verge when it was 200But verge is at a loss last time I checked, xvg is a scamcoin for sure its for the best
ethereum moonsrest of portfolio crashes
So what&#039;s the price floor for this in the short term? I bought at 100 sats so I have no reason not to ever sell, but I&#039;m just curious.
&gt;&gt;2374428*no reason to ever sell
no one knows and if you&#039;re a dumb hodler then why do you care?just keep doing your hodling thing, I mean if you were smart you would have gotten out above 2000 like everyone else, but you&#039;re not, you&#039;re a dumb hodler so leave the figuring out prices to buy and sell and go back to doing nothing with your life
Just set a buy order at 1400 before going to sleep yesterday and woke up to it at 1660 and sold it all again while you&#039;ll just HODLing on a scamcoin that has nothing behind it.Well played.
&gt;&gt;2374475I&#039;m not a degenerate day trader though. I buy coins with the intention of holding them long term (&gt;1 year) and in the end that pays off much better than day trading. Imagine being retarded enough to sell all your ETH when it first hit $20 a year ago.
&gt;&gt;2374520&gt;I&#039;m not a degenerate day trader&gt;he said on the 4chan monopoly money shill boardyou&#039;re right, you&#039;re just a retard that hates free money.
&gt;&gt;2374520And imagine being retarded enough to think that when someone sells they can&#039;t buy back in.&gt;degenerate day traderBack to /pol/ with your stupid memes, daytrading is degenerate because you&#039;re a fucking idiot, got it.
&gt;&gt;2374475That didn&#039;t sound like a bitter bag holder bought in above 2000 at all.
&gt;&gt;2374551I mean, I&#039;m up $40k in less than one month from hodling. How much have you made from day trading in that amount of time?
rofl
&gt;&gt;2374553It didn&#039;t because it isn&#039;t&gt;&gt;2374568&gt;dollars instead of percentagesCute way of masking that you started with 20k or 35k or some shit
&gt;&gt;2374605Nope, started with $15k. Up to $55k now.
&gt;&gt;2374428its going down to 200 or so
It&#039;s not looking so good.I would&#039;ve got out had I been awake but now I&#039;m just waiting for it to dip to 1200-1300 and I might sell.
Have 6600 DGBMan this feels so badThis has to be whale manipulation right? Must have confidence in this shit if they are working so hard to tank prices to buy and accumulate right? Must think this coin will go up in the long termr-right?
Is this happening because of yesterday&#039;s presentation with Citi or just your average dip?
&gt;&gt;2374969&gt;averageIt went from 2400 to 1200 in 24 hoursIts not a normal dip. Its whale manipulation and weak hands who bought into the hype way to late and panicked and sold which caused whales to buy and force prices low to shake weak hands and accumulate more DGBMain Citibank prize is next month
&gt;&gt;237495614k here, bought near ATH on the hype, holding $400 worth of bags now. All good, that made itself back up in my ETH, but I really don&#039;t wanna keep looking at this ball and chain for the next couple weeks waiting for the next awards

&gt;&gt;2374956&gt;&gt;2374969&gt;&gt;2375007You guys just have to ask yourselves 1 question.What has actually happened with this coin to warrant is value increasing 2000% in less than a month?&gt;&gt;2375007You&#039;re right. It&#039;s not a dip, it&#039;s a correction. Correction from a price that was only achieved though hype and shilling.Until the digibytes team does or achieves something to make the coin worth 2000, it will never be stable at that price.
&gt;&gt;2375104yep. thank you.it looks like will return to 3k satjust hodl
&gt;&gt;2375124This is crypto, anon. If you think these markets follow rules you&#039;re going to have a bad time.
Is this a meme?
I&#039;m actually curious how the blockchain works and learn what makes a project good or not.Any resources you can recommend?
Coinbase says that it&#039;s charging two small amounts to my debit card in order to verify, but I don&#039;t see shit. I&#039;ve been trying this for like a month now.Is anyone else having this problem? Maybe I&#039;m just looking in the wrong place?
If you missed it they get taken off. Just link your bank account.
&gt;&gt;2375013Yeah but it takes like a fucking week to buy shit that way
&gt;&gt;2374966Check your pending transactions, not confirmed ones. If you can&#039;t call your bank and ask them.
pic relatedhow likely do you think are these coins to pump/fail miserably?what is the rest of /biz/ holding?
&gt;digibyte. Done fucked anon.Just hold until the bottom out.

We are saving everyone by getting on the ARK. Are you on the ARK?
To be saved by the ARK, one must first defeat the bots.
I&#039;m hodling 6k but goddamn this coin has shown just how horrible this environment is for buying altcoins, all exchanges are literally shit
Stop posting these threads and chill. Ark is long term
man fuck the bots honestly
Nigger this OP is shit, you didn&#039;t even tell people anything. Not about the node. Not how to download the wallet. Not how to vote. Not how close we are to top 51. Nothing. Fucking kill yourself for this low effort shit.
to test stuff out i send 2 ark from bittrex to my wallet and then send 1 ark back. the transaction of the 1 ark has been confirmed, but never showed up on bittrex. it is not in the wallet anymore either.anyone has an explanation? the adress is certainly correct
Fuck no, the buyers can&#039;t even get rid of the whale that&#039;s obviously manipulating the market for this coin. Have fun with that.
when will you losers learn to just hold eth and btc and quit losing sleep over shitcoin pumps which you&#039;ll end up losing money on in the end anyway?shitty sentence but w/e
i just realized my portfolio would be worth TWICE as much right now... had I only put all my money in btc/ethseriously no idea why I keep putting money in shitcoins at this point
ETH is a cetralized shit coin with an overcomplicated contract system , it will crash when someone finds an exploit.
&gt;&gt;2374261because it&#039;s fun?
&gt;&gt;2374247been holding nothing but ETH since the 20&#039;s, seeing people go berserk over shitcoin p&amp;d&#039;s never ceases to confuse mejust put that shit in ETH and relax senpai
&gt;&gt;2374261&gt;seriously no idea why I keep putting money in shitcoins at this pointhigh risk high reward, whereas eth and btc are low risk low reward short term, medium risk high reward long term. If you can successfully short some pnds and such, you can get more disposable assets and it&#039;s just fun. Some of us have nothing to lose and everything to win.
1QBLhn5yQYmjxokEXS8uzzhjeTzBwNzfff
&gt;&gt;2374261Thats your fault. I bought digibyte at 116 and sold it for 2300Most of my portfolio is eth. I buy and sell shitcoins just for fun
&gt;&gt;2374288Yep nothing to lose. I starts from 17$ and now I have 2.2k$.
&gt;&gt;2374339i just bought a shit ton of reddcoin at a dip and i&#039;m already up big time, i could sell this shit right now and have a pretty good profit and then rinse repeat, put it into eth, whatever. For depressed wagecucks like myself who has lost passion for everything in life, this gives me some sort of purpose. I play retarded paradox games that are basically spreadsheets anyway, why not play a game with real stakes.
&gt;DGB losing me money&gt;Made up for by ETH going up in valueThis is why you make safe hedge investments!!
Me with STRATIS right now
I should&#039;ve got out and all-inned on eth when Digi was at it&#039;s athDigi still losing me gains right now
&gt;&gt;2374861Dont even get me started on this one
&gt;&gt;2374869and it will continue..the excitement on DGB is done
&gt;&gt;2374927Yeah, I don&#039;t doubt it. But I already hedl through the peak so I&#039;m gonna hodl through this downwards trend and I&#039;ll sell the next real peak. Not selling for 50% what it was a few days ago
&gt;&gt;2374846&gt;This is why you make safe hedge investments!!So you&#039;re +-0 ?Cool strategy!
because of Coinbase?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcNnMqI9Xno
&gt;&gt;2373607yes sell now
&gt;&gt;2373607Lel, keep your head cool anon :) It&#039;s only a small volume. You muricans think you&#039;re so powerful when you&#039;re not.
&gt;&gt;2373607coinbase only started offering eth in late april early may... it hasn&#039;t been a year for &quot;whales&quot; to cash out yet
&gt;&gt;2373607i don&#039;t think so but that&#039;s not bad analysis
&gt;&gt;2373667nah they offered it july 21 last summer
&gt;&gt;2373607&gt;income taxes&gt;&quot;cashing out&quot; as actual cash rather than buying heroin on the darkweb
&gt;&gt;2373705correction: Jul 21, 2016was when they first started offering EthRegardless, I doubt whales will cash out all their eth at the end of July...they may hold until the end of the year to not lose any more gains.
wait even if I hold it I have to pay for tax?! no right?
&gt;&gt;2373747yes
&gt;90 viewsStop shilling your shit youtube channel faggot.
&gt;&gt;2373790no
&gt;90 views&gt;No commentsSo you just came accross this video huh? Gee.Reported for shilling :^
&gt;&gt;2373816just like and subscribe ok
&gt;&gt;2373607I&#039;d put some stock into this theory if the guy that made the video wasn&#039;t a complete idiot.
ETH is going to crash when EOS drops
Seems logical.Though the amount of people willing to hold for an entire year I would assume is low.But I suppose if you&#039;re an early adopter you don&#039;t give a shit.
&gt;&gt;2373933don&#039;t make an ass out of u and me senpai

what are yobit coins.
Coins ready for a pump and dump.
&gt;&gt;2370887I&#039;ll give you a clue: If you&#039;re thinking of an answer relating to anything after September 2015 you&#039;re wrong.
&gt;&gt;2370876jews.
&gt;&gt;2370903LOTS OF BAGHOLDERS!!
&gt;&gt;2370876Coins that mooned in the last bubble, and are mooning now again. Indicating that we are once more in a bubble.1NN4cmXCp5hAbxBZSUaPo61TjTUSRGwnQN

&gt;&gt;2370920With the last bubble, I mean right before Mt Gox crash in 2014.
All past their prime
Coins that are has-beens, they used to be worth more than they are right now. Were pumped and dumped during Bubbles1AK7HNEctA3zzbtiaHUdmciN9t3YiFURUT
They are all 2+ year old coins (most ANN on bitcointalk are 2013-2014). None are based on ETH?
&gt;&gt;2370920&gt;&gt;2370934What he said except for now we&#039;re not in a bubble.1L3RHfJztcCEB7LZByUW4GXHuqQzVxzgCC
&gt;&gt;2370876what are fates that nucoins like ETH XEM and XRP will soon face.
&gt;&gt;2370903Bush did 9/11
&gt;&gt;2370944Yes both points to note.
&gt;&gt;2370961Alright I&#039;ll bite once more. They&#039;re also all non-turing complete. You can add that to my answer if you think it&#039;s relevant. (might be in 10 years)
copypasta coins
&gt;&gt;2370876Mining was frontloaded, i.e. a lot of the coin&#039;s supply was mined shortly after the ICO?Only thing I can think of. Some of those coins are fucking obscure.
&gt;&gt;2370987Doge didn&#039;t have an ICO. That can&#039;t be the answer.
Coins that OP has been holding since last bubble
All decentralised LTC derivatives?Are you saying something is going to happen to LTC?
&gt;&gt;2370876these are all supershticoins that no one should ever invest in
Proof of work?
&gt;&gt;2370987Some specifically didn&#039;t.
&gt;&gt;2370995Ltc is an ltc derivative now? The causal link between all members of a set and the set itself can&#039;t be a part of the set. Unless OP is retarded it has to be something else than that.
&gt;&gt;2371011Pre-mine?
&gt;&gt;2370997Part of the list is explained by PoW yes.
They are all created and mostly owned by the same group of people
All Bitcoin forks?

&gt;&gt;2371032Yes
they&#039;re all shitcoins

&gt;&gt;2371054dont be a faggot.
&gt;&gt;2371045Wait what. Did I win?
&gt;&gt;2371032if this was the actual answer I&#039;m gonna kill myself
So, Bitcoin forks, are all old, and bring nothing to the table other than being currencies (nothing like stratis or factom)
&gt;&gt;2371054&gt;that&#039;s not the answer friendo
&gt;&gt;2371060You can send me some too. Don&#039;t be shy.&gt;1L3RHfJztcCEB7LZByUW4GXHuqQzVxzgCC
Old ass shitcoins? Darkcoin is Dash now though, not that it&#039;s not a piece of shit.
&gt;&gt;2371063Don&#039;t do that, anon. It was a fun game.
&gt;&gt;2371062No sorry :(
They all use the scrypt hashing algorithm
&gt;&gt;2371064All btc forksAll PoS or PoWAll from before the Mt Gox crashNone of them have risen in value sinceSome of them have gimmicks but no real value proposition.What type of rule would select only these coins from a list of all coins?

None of them use SHA-256
&gt;&gt;2371104&gt;Is this the entire list of what fits within the &#039;theme&#039; or just a part of it?It&#039;s the entire list there&#039;s a specific sentence which gets this list.
They are all coins biz doesn&#039;t shill and avoids
gpu mining
All threads about these coins were archived when you made this thread.
&gt;&gt;2371112The gimmicks part
Segwit
I need to sleep. Someone get it already.
Peercoin was actually the first PoS coin. novacoin was the first to make use of both pos and pow. YAcoin is aderivative of both peercoin and Novacoin.Is this a list of coins that were built on top of each others&#039; technology?
They&#039;ve all been hacked
&gt;&gt;2371152True but that wouldn&#039;t get you this list specifically.
All of these coins survived the OG BTC crash?
There is no answer and OP just like messin&#039; with us. :-)
&gt;&gt;2370876Dont listen /biz/ about those shitcoins1ayy2DoLj5ZHHyQgJZFuyFqNM5gb6sRB4
Free bump!Now, make a &#039;&#039;Roll&#039;&#039; here&gt;&gt;2370686
The thing that they have in common is that the only place they&#039;re all mentioned together is here:&gt;&gt;2370876
&gt;&gt;2371185It&#039;s a list of coins that all have gimmicks that are non-exclusive to one an another. Do you want to build a coin implementing some or most of these features because you believe that all together they would lead to a superior coin?
&gt;&gt;2371112Coins from 2012-2014 that introduced some (small, gimmicky parameter) change?This is just a ruse, right OP? There&#039;s not many other common factors than what have been mentioned unless I&#039;m missing something. They weren&#039;t on any common exchange from what I remember.
Androids Token is a weird one. Not much on it anywhere.
&gt;&gt;2371223There is although I&#039;m not sure how obvious it is that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking - trying to gauge how /biz/ thinks.
One more hint. Is it tech or something else?
&gt;&gt;2371254This is how I think. Fuck you.
&gt;&gt;2371254I&#039;m going to go for a while however I&#039;ll see if someone happens across the answer later.
&gt;&gt;2371254Coins (from 2012-2014) introducing new mining algorithms? Quite sure that doesn&#039;t apply to all actually.
&gt;&gt;2371271op no dont
&gt;&gt;2371268Me too
&gt;&gt;2370876they&#039;re all forks which lead to more forks than their siblings?
&gt;&gt;2370903&gt;September 2015what did he mean by this
the theme they share is PoS (proof of stake)1NbES9it8RmzWPYKaArYaW3iXbnPnEH2Uk
&gt;&gt;2370876They have all been timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain through via Ledger. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_(journal)Thanks OP, that was fun.1HJ6A1N7QfXxuDdAXymHjWxsMRVcuxr2Bv
I think I&#039;m on the right track. I just need to see the pattern. But I got why the September 2015 clue is crucial, by the way
I don&#039;t know what the answer to the question is but I AM autistic enough to recognize ops writing style. I know who you be Mr whale arrr
They were all the 1st to do something significant in the history of crypto.IE: Nova coin was the 1st PoS combined with scryptLitecoin was the First cryptocurrency to use scrypt and a faster block generation rate1H8pa4vLNwW6fVGKNhzgF97qCc3T4UKUzh
&gt;&gt;2371696Already said, you just worded it differently.
Ok cash, I find it laughable the fact that nobody talks about it here, almost insigunificantes walls until the 10 thousand satoshis, listed in the bitrex, while I say he just uploaded 100 satoshis, for sure it will be a top volume coin soon, at least for one day12t2rH6cm3VPW7mQJeg5fzDjjyXh7iZ6dZ
&gt;&gt;2371271I think I get you. These coins are now worthless. The coins now will be worthless after an imminent crash.
&gt;&gt;2371736wat
&gt;&gt;2371736huh
the coin okcash ,just check in bitrex ,is going to 10k satoshi today&gt;&gt;2371756&gt;&gt;2371764
just look the sell wal ,is just 1,4 bitcoin for 6k ,i think is going to more than 10k
&gt;&gt;2371799&gt;&gt;2371811
&gt;&gt;2371826
&gt;&gt;2371799I love you /biz/
They all have a MIT license?
Okay. I&#039;m stuck... might as well share what I found. If this helps you win anything, don&#039;t hesitate to throw some of your gains my way: 1BJVakRy3dy45EsqWPaBnf53QJMM44JY4AHe&#039;s referring to september 2015 because this is the last date present on this website: http://mapofcoins.com/bitcoin.Here&#039;s a rough map of the tree involved:A) bitcoin &gt; peercoin &gt; novacoin &gt; yacoin &gt; vertcoin &gt; altcoin&gt; cubitsB) bitcoin &gt; sifcoin &gt; quark &gt; darkcoin &gt; x14C) bitcoin &gt; tenebrix &gt; litecoin &gt; feathercoin &gt; securecoin&gt; starcoin &gt; androids tokens &gt; colossus coin&gt; smartcoin &gt; spots &gt; copperbars&gt; junkcoin &gt; luckycoin &gt; dogeHere&#039;s when each leaf (i.e., the last coin in a branch) has appeared:x14: july 14colossus: august 13copperbar: august 13securecoin: may 13doge: december 13altcoin: february 14cubits: november 13I tried using their filter (top left) but I don&#039;t get any obvious patterns. Also I&#039;m not sure the data is correct (altcoin is &quot;defunct on arrival).Good luck /biz/. I&#039;ll let you know if I find anything else.
&gt;&gt;2371950Crap.it messed up my beautiful tree.A) cubits starts from novacoin.C) the sub-branches start from litecoin
They were all on Stasibit
&gt;&gt;2371950This anon deserves a cookie for sure OP.
&gt;&gt;2371950Last addendum. I wrote my message in a hurry. I forgot to put apostrophes in front of the numbers. those are years, not days... &#039;13 as in 2013.
To me, I can officially say these look like they were created by the same developer or team.Same structure: p2p trade, same rare website domains ie:. cc and orgs. Looks like the dev rolled with the winning coins.18eFq53pUuupfxyeQnRqfg8Yw5dYDgBSCL
Yeah... There&#039;s also a search function below the timeline. It&#039;s somewhat broken (it stops working and I need to refresh the page to fix it). I tried searching for common keywords and I got no results.But I have an idea... to highlight the complete path to include every single one of those coins, you just need to find something in common between the leaves (since the parents of said leave will have to be highlighted anyway):altcoin, cubits, x14, securecoin, colossus, copperbars and doge.
They are all coins that experienced a huge bubble during the summer.
&gt;&gt;2370876near identical chart activity but i dont know enough about charting to say more
&gt;&gt;2370876You mined a fuckton of them with your GPU before 2015, because they were all unpopular bitcoin forks with small network hashrates and with the price going sideways, and now you hope some of them moon.There&#039;s your theme
They all use the MIT license
They all will have some form of inflation like 1% a year
ThxIts inflation right?:D
&gt;&gt;2370876all coins created by the same scammerwhat do I win
OP, don&#039;t leave us hanging. Just reveal it if it hasn&#039;t been solved yet.
I think these were all listed on Mintpal, Darkcoin became Dash so at least that one was successful
I&#039;m still waiting for an answer !
Elementrum seems like it&#039;s pumping on the dapp meme
/biz/ exchange...Why not open a thread for exchanging? Fuck these exchanges. Let&#039;s trade amongst ourselves.&gt;How can I trust anon, anon?Trade in increments.I&#039;m trying to get ahold of some alt-coins and i&#039;m willing to get taxed because my main &quot;Core&quot; (BTC,ETH) are slow as fuck and are still going through processing.
&gt;&gt;2374018There is too much third world trash on 4chan for anyone to ever trade here.
&gt;trusting /biz/&gt;working with anonymous people
It could work if there were a simple escrow app that pulled an averaged exchange rate from the top 3 exchanges.
&gt;&gt;2374018All /biz has to sell is DGB bags
&gt;&gt;2374156Yes but if you use an escrow app you might as well use an exchange.
Let&#039;s try it outSend me some bitcoins OP1AUPYi2EhNaofPDnZCpqceHCEM7zS1mEzG
&gt;believing an entire board of early-twenties men obsessed with money will trade honestlywew
&gt;&gt;2374802yes and countless yobit crap coins
Maybe we could think up some algorithm to make this work, like both parties lock up some ETH in an escrow-like contract, and they only get it back once it&#039;s been verified by multiple users that the coins have arrived on both addresses (you can check via blockchain.info etc..). Not sure if that&#039;s 100% secure, you&#039;d have to trust a pool of /biz/nizmen to actually vote fairly, for one.
&gt;&gt;2374871If most of these posts are from early-twenty year olds, that is just sad. Most sound 13-17 and many whine and complain like the modern day snowflakes
