DO YOU KNOWWHAT TIME IT IS?!?!
It is fucking buy BITBEAN time for me!
&gt;&gt;2293480THERE&#039;S JUST NO STOPPING THIS LIL&#039;GUY
Forget about RDD and DGB. The spaceship is gone. Get your tickets for the next big moon ride.
And what would that be
Isn&#039;t the verge picture suppose to be on the rocket?
&gt;&gt;2293862Why buy if it has already mooned?
&gt;&gt;2293900ZenCash. Hitting Bittrex today
&gt;&gt;2294121Hasn&#039;t even started m8
&gt;&gt;2293862lol i agree 100% wil the xvg buybut you are a fucking retard
&gt;&gt;2294121&gt;moonedWhitepaper will be released in the next 24 hours, check the verge dev twitter. Last chance before this goes at least to 300, if not 500 sats. Plus there are other updates which they plan to release soon.I do have to say RDD guys are faggots, even if they are working on it they aren&#039;t updating the public thus that coin will still crash most likely below 100 sats this week.
&gt;&gt;2293862From what I&#039;ve been seeing, VOX has more potential for a good old fashioned meme-coin pump.&gt; XVG - $77,662,702 Cap&gt; VOX - $2,029,167 CapThink my shit-coin fund is going to go to the other current-shill on this thread.
&gt;&gt;2294272It was released 8 hrs ago jackass
Hey /biz/ listen up, I&#039;ve got something to tell you. Right now the 3 sat sell wall is at 2.51 btcThe Moon Coin community is only growing in numbers and ever since it&#039;s been added on the ccex exchange it&#039;s only been going in on direction, up.Remember how everyone made fun of RDD and its bagholders? Well look at it now, easily over 100 sats and showing no signs of stopping. Anyone who&#039;s thrown away an easy $1,000 into RDD and bought at 1 sat and held onto it easily has over $100k right now.Right now, MOON is facing a similar trend to it, it&#039;s been pumped and dumped and yet despite that, it&#039;s actually fucking growing...Exactly like RDD has.Do you really want to miss this next Moon mission?Now join the rest of us at https://discord.gg/xkC6GjcWe&#039;re a growing community and even though I&#039;ve personally only been there for a few days, I can already see the potential and I can see the drive that the people have to really get Moon coin going.And for anyone interested, these are the positions that we&#039;re looking to get filled:1. Graphic designers2. Video producers3. Development contributers4. PR agents5. Sales executives6. Merchandisers7. Social media page/community managers8. Web designers9. TranslatorsOr if you want, you don&#039;t even have to fill a position, just having your presence and support is more than enough to really give MOON what it needs to travel to the moon and beyond.Hey guess what? The Sell wall is now 1.98 btc..that&#039;s the sound of people desperately trying to get into MOON before it truly starts rocketing.
kys
&gt;&gt;2286919i bought 2 days ago for 2 sat and already sold 50% at 4 sat (on c-cex), thus made my initial back.Now im hodling for the launch.If I would&#039;ve followed your advice and taken no risk I would have been worse off.
&gt;&gt;2286919I bought 8.2 million at 1 sat, and now I&#039;m seeing 200% gains about to become 300% gains.I&#039;m sure that someone said the same thing to the guy who advertised RDD in the beginning and now that motherfucker who shilled RDD is driving a lambo right now as we speak.Don&#039;t you want to be part of lamboland like that guy?
&gt;&gt;2286977High risk high reward. I bought 3 Million, money i could care to lose. I just dont want to feel like an idiot if it really takes off.Also, lurking the moon discord and seeing live how mooncoin won the c-cex won convinced me.
Moon has great potential, its soo great that people either love it or hate it. How can anyone hate a coin called moon?
want a coin that actually have value and is still very cheap?check out RDD&gt;&gt;2286719
&gt;&gt;2286913Sell wall is about to be below 1 btc.I was skeptical about this coin but it&#039;s really fucking happening.All these people saying &quot;kys&quot; that&#039;s fine. Miss the train, you&#039;re going to want to kys when you see it blow up and you missed the chance just because /biz/ said it was a scam.Do your own research, they are actually turning this coin around.
&gt;&gt;2287005Its a zombie coin, so not only is their risk involved, there is triple risk involved.
SELL WALL IS AT FUCKING 1.24 BTCI REPEAT, SELL WALL IS AT FUCKING 1.24 BTC
I threw some pocket change at it for 4.5 million.
its almost gone anons
Goodbye, 3 sat sell wall.
WE ARE NOW FACING AGAINST THE 4 SAT SELL WALL.HODL
Moon is getting bought at 100 million an hour now. At this pace we&#039;ll be at 10 satoshis by tomorrow

&gt;&gt;22876984sat = $24m market capGood luck getting $600m on meme coin while the bottom is trying to sell off ASAP
FUDers are false flag shills keeping the price artificially down to increase their bags before the inevitable 100x pump.They are the true Mooncoin shills.
&gt;&gt;2288944Why are mooncoin shills so hungry to double their money? Is it that nice of a sure double after buying in at 1 sat? why not just ride the DGB wave?
C&#039;mon fags fill my buy order at 1 sat.
&gt;&gt;2289006Guess in your retarded ass brain you never stopped to think that this isn&#039;t a shill and that this is actually happening.I&#039;ll be at Lamboland soon enough.
&gt;&gt;2289129I&#039;ll remember to buy in at 1 sat next time as well
&gt;&gt;2286913Mooning rigth now.
when is this getting on bittrex? otherwise it will just get dumped at 4 sat again
&gt;&gt;2290287I use Bleutrade for moon.&gt;&gt;2290227&gt;4 sat&gt;mooningSHIGGY

&gt;&gt;2290440suck it
Ahahha you poor desperate baggers!
&gt;tfw sold my 1sat buy of 2.2mil at 2sat after the initial dumphehe gas me
Last chance to get on the moon rocket.We will break 4 sats today and from there 10 will be easy.After that you better strap your a-holes down for the ride.
&gt;&gt;2292212It&#039;s already back at its ath you stupid faggot
&gt;&gt;2292459and its tearing the 4 sat wall slowly, even the 5 sat wall went down a bit, i think this may rocket out soon, glad i still have some coins on me
&gt; The Moon Coin community is only growing in numbersThere is no community, only people who wanted to be in the P&amp;D. If this coin disappeared tomorrow and people got their money back, nobody would even mention it again the next day, or ever in their lives
&gt;&gt;2292527you sound butthurt
Past hour saw again 80 million buy orders and virtually no sells. Wow I already have 35 mil should I get some more? I have only 4 hours to decide at this rate... if dubs I&#039;ll buy 15 mil, kek wills it.
&gt;&gt;2293066ayy, buy them
&gt;&gt;2293066Kek has spoken.
&gt;&gt;2293066BUY. OR KEK WILL STRIKE YOU DOWN
&gt;&gt;2293066Damn.I got in but maybe I should&#039;ve bought more.Its still early enough.
4 sat wall fallen on NOVA )))
&gt;&gt;2293177They&#039;re chewing through in huge chunks on Bleu as well.
&gt;&gt;2293092Miscalculated fees and slippage. Do you think kek will show mercy?
&gt;Coinbase is Jewing meBTC transfer fee keeps rising with the amount I&#039;m transferring so it won&#039;t let me. It&#039;s literally asking me for 90% of the transfer as a fee and then says error.
&gt;&gt;22869134 sat wall soon to fall on c-cexMooncoin going to the moon
&gt;&gt;2293346Transfer bitcoin to litecoin on coinbase. Send with 0.001 ltc fee. Trade to btc on bleutrade trade to moon.
TAKE ME TO THE MOON
&gt;&gt;2293378I can&#039;t figure out how. I go to buy and the only option is to buy with cash and not transfer other coins.
&gt;&gt;2293449I dont use coinbase but i&#039;m sure it should be possible.Any anon willing yo help our bro on the moonrocket?Also once you figure it out you could also try ether instead. The litecoin book on bleutrade is very thin.
Almost gone 4 sat wall on bleau
Also anons this is really happening!Volume at 68 btc a day at bleutrade. 99% buy orders.If this continues we&#039;ll eat through the walls up to 8 sats by tomorrow.Such a rise usually generates more volume so 10 sats is not totally out there.MOON!!!
TEAR THE 5 SAT WALL NOW, AFTER THIS, WE ARE ON THE M O O N
no resistance after 10sat better get on when you can
Wow. No hesitation 50 million in 4 minutes. 5 sat wall only 530 million.

Wonder when the whales will dump this time...last time it was 5sat
if you delusional fuckers dont sell now you&#039;re getting fucked in the ass in a few hours, this shitcoin aint goiing above 5-6 sats

What is this coin actually going to be used for?
&gt;&gt;2293962moonbase and lamborghinis
Last 150 mil available at 5! Only 50 minutes ago there were 600 mil of them. Get them while you can boys.
Serious questionThere is a 100 btc sell wall every 10 satDaily volume is barely 100 btcHow do we ever make it?
&gt;&gt;2293975a lot of volume will be moved up in order to hodl for more profit
Join the original Discord: https://discord.gg/JpqEb
Reminder that this is a long-hold for at least half a year before we even make any significant progress. Remember bean, then redd? All below 10 sats on average for far longer than they should have been. If Moon sees itself onto other exchanges it might just follow suit. Don&#039;t sell your 1-3 sat orders until it hits 50+ in a year or so.
&gt;&gt;2293975Volume is going exponential bro. 4 sat wall broke 1 hour ago. 5 sat wall was 590 million moon or 29 btc.Now its down to 150 or 7,5 thats 22,5 btc volume buying only in an hour.Volume will easily be 500 btc by tommorow the we&#039;ll swolp through these walls easily.
&gt;&gt;2293975Do you remember RDD?
&gt;&gt;2294071you mean the thing that&#039;s still going to moon?yeah i do
the fuck is happeningwhy is it shooting up again already, is this another PnD? I bought at 1sat and just hodl/ignored for about a week..
&gt;&gt;2294071Yes but rdd has a viable product.Moon is just a meme
&gt;&gt;2294105I&#039;ve bought at 1 sat and same as you have ignored it for weeks but today sold half of them for 4 sat.(Bought for 0.05 btc, poor poor )
&gt;&gt;2294112Mhh no it has active development.It also still needs to be added on bittrex. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll jump on the train once it reaches 20 sats.Plus meme magik
Make new thread guys
Can&#039;t I just trade between exchanges?Bitcoins slow as shit, so couldn&#039;t I do ETH or doge?
Is it too late to buy in? Thinking of hopping onto mooncoin. Also what exchanges is it on
No coiner fag here, waiting for my bank to authorize me to transfer EUR to BTC but i wont have anything for days&gt;tfw will miss the moon
&gt;&gt;2294229&gt;Can&#039;t I just trade between exchanges?The term is called arbitrage trading and there are people out there with fasters computers and much faster internet connections doing it.
&gt;What is mooncoin?http://moonchan.org/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1733963.0http://www.mooncoin.com/Discord: https://discord.gg/jRfsHQ
86 million left at 5 satoshi. This thing is going so hard.
I reflect on what I thought to be buying this coin in the meantime. I boarded the train of the Moon late.

Thoughts on VTorrent?
&gt;&gt;2291794A gem which /biz/ has bought to my attention
scam, buy bitbean instead
It is a good coin. You get paid for uploading pirate content.It should go up during the next days. Right now it is searching a support after this pump
If even one part of the tech that is promised can be delivered, this will be an incredibly valuable token. I bought some a few days ago.
I buy every coin /biz/ shill and i&#039;m up a lot.
&gt;&gt;2291794I think its getting dumped
&gt;bought at 10k&gt;bought again at 13.2k&gt;mfw when it&#039;s at 9.4klooks like I&#039;m holding for a while
&gt;&gt;2291892Enjoy fag holder should have held a real coin like dgb
&gt;&gt;2291892Yeah, I think we got pumped and dumped friend.
&gt;&gt;2291899rofl
&gt;&gt;2291892&gt;&gt;2291903Question is, hold or sell for a loss? I rather sell for a loss an invest in something else than hold this for days.
&gt;&gt;2291913I started shilling this coin because I think it has huge potential. It all depends on the dev, though.
Definitely just got pump and dumped but I feel like it&#039;ll keep going up the next few days. Just hold.
&gt;&gt;2291892Same here my dude.&gt;&gt;2291913I&#039;d say just hold it. Its very late in the U.S. and still early in Europe. /biz/ never pumps a coin only for a couple hours so I expect this to continue to rise if only for a couple more days
&gt;&gt;2291923I hope you are right, feels bad though.Dump happened so fucking fast that I didn&#039;t even had time to react.
&gt;&gt;2291892&gt;also bought in at 13.2oh well lucky it was only about $30usd worth
It&#039;s up again
I&#039;m gonna sell this shit once it gets to 13k, not going near that insane market manipulation, coin goes from 9 to 11 in a matter of seconds and then crashes again.
&gt;&gt;2291913Looking at this entire situation... It reminds me of Edgeless a week or two ago.Out of nowhere, discussion comes up, this thread popped up with tons of people talking about it, EDG was also around 8k sat too now that I think about it.So all of a sudden it&#039;s jumps up to around 14k too actually, then falls back down and boom all discussion and everything about it was done and the pump and dump was over. Till now it still hasn&#039;t kissed 14k again, I had bought at 12k, and had to sell at a slight loss.It was such a blitz, came and went like the wind. I&#039;ve seen EDG mentioned like twice since then.
&gt;&gt;2291985Well, as if we need more confirmation that this board is getting filled with more and more shills and whales lurking by the day.In a seriousness now, I think a mod really need to enforce rules about shilling more. I don&#039;t mind when an anon makes a thoughtful post/OP saying why he thinks coin X is bad, but OPs like &#039;&#039;X IS GONNA PUMP, MOON MISSION, GET IN GET IN&#039;&#039; are like 90% of the catalog now and need to be deleted. It really hurts the overall quality of the board and turns this into a shill playground. It&#039;s getting out of control.
&gt;&gt;2292037coin X is good or bad*
Balls deep in XVG. Got in at 180. White paper released. Insane trading volume. How long till take off?
hodl, buddyonly place to go is up
&gt;&gt;2292481&gt;sold 80k at 22 sat&gt;bought 11k at 92Still holding. Going slow and steady upwards. We&#039;re getting spoiled.
&gt;tfw in at 44&gt;stopped checking for a week&gt;mfw just checked coinmarketcap
&gt;got in at 7&gt;this shit will never go anywhere&gt;sell at 8&gt;see yoda mention it&gt;shit nigga, this might actually be worth something&gt;get back in at 48&gt;here we aredon&#039;t doubt the cryptomemers on twitter
&gt;&gt;2292498Holding 125k for the dear life.
700k in at 41sat.comfy feels
&gt;tfw literally sold 20 thousand dollars worth of XVG for 1000
&gt;&gt;2292500&gt;remember i had millions of dogecoindarks at 2 sat&gt;when DOGED turned to XVG i just sold it all for no reason
&gt;bought 500k at 15 satWhy did I buy into this scamcoin and why is it still going up?????
&gt;&gt;2292594it&#039;s not a scamcoinit&#039;s going up because it&#039;s not a scamcoin
&gt;&gt;2292594It&#039;s a coin that could be comparable to Monero and look where it is now.
XVG = true real anonimity
&gt;&gt;2292594hype&gt;&gt;2292599&gt;&gt;2292643Monero&#039;s tech is much betterVerge is a coin made with duck tape
&gt;&gt;2292671&gt;duck tapeok
&gt;&gt;2292481I keep telling people that he whitepaper shows that this is the true ANON coin. If Monero is worth $45 then this is worth $100. Everyone should be holding this long term.
&gt;&gt;2292517Who are some cryptomemers on twitter. The ones I got are too many memes and straw hands.
&gt;&gt;2292715if this is worth $100 i&#039;m in lambolandi hope you&#039;re right
&gt;&gt;2292715I&#039;m just going to hold to $10. Enough for millionaire status.
&gt;&gt;2292730Im just saying anon that this tech is better than Monero. Their devs are extremely passionate about this project and this is great for the dark web. XVG has a better chance to make it than most shitcoins.
when is takeoff? it already happened dipshit
&gt;&gt;2292715I&#039;m have high hopes for XVG but you can&#039;t compare its price to Monero. Verge has over 900x as many coins in circulation. If it were to match Monero&#039;s market cap, it would be at around $.05.
&gt;&gt;2292754It has a 13 billion coin supply.&gt;&gt;2292846Given his opinion, I presume this guy to have an IQ of at least 90.But all crypto is going to explode; It hasn&#039;t even reached its final form. Who&#039;s to say this market isn&#039;t worth 20x, or even 200x a year from now?The inflation would be incredibly, incredibly real as people start selling their belongings to get in on crypto. I&#039;d weep. If someone like Tony Robbins can exist for more than 5 years, this shit can go fucking haywire. Hopefully it doesn&#039;t get that far, though.
&gt;&gt;2292846XVG will be a $1 by the end of the year. screenshot this.
&gt;&gt;2292481You guys are really noobs on /biz/... sometimes it hurts me to read. Verge is not a bad coin as far as shitcoins go. It&#039;s multi-algo like Myriadcoin and has decent wallet support. Maybe I would put a few pennies on it. It might go somewhere. But it has nothing on Monero. Monero has ring signatures. Verge is a standard utxo-based coin. I don&#039;t even buy their argument that you will get anonymity just from running wallets through tor. Of course people can still do taint analysis on your address. If it was that easy, there would be no need for Monero to exist.
&gt;&gt;2292887Hyperinflation has to go somewhere in the world as central banks print into oblivion. A lot of these memecoins will die off, but the surviving few will have a ridiculous market cap. The whitepaper is also extremely solid.
&gt;&gt;2292725verthaog and cryptoyoda
I&#039;ll invest 20 BTCs in this if you can tell me why this is better than Monero or ZcashProtip:you can&#039;t
&gt;&gt;2293621If you did it 2 days ago you would be up way way over 100%
&gt;&gt;2293726Maybe, but that&#039;s also true for a lot of meme coins out there. It&#039;s quite difficult to know what meme coin will boom and when it will boom, and won&#039;t put so much money on something based only on memes, I need more solid information to invest.
&gt;&gt;2293621&gt;MoneroI can tell you why not to be in Monero.They are getting fucking sued by Visa.
&gt;&gt;2293745You can just look it up dumbass, they have a twitter
&gt;&gt;2293745xvg is no memecoin senpaiwait the coming monthsalthough that could be said for most coins, even true shitcoins
&gt;&gt;2293747I didn&#039;t say I was Invested in Monero, I asked what this coin has over Monero or Zcash, why it&#039;s better or unique compared to them?&gt;They are getting fucking sued by Visa.And why is that?&gt;&gt;2293752I read about the coin, that&#039;s the problem. It doesn&#039;t seem to have anything special over the coins I mentioned.
1k sats by the end of week fags
&gt;&gt;2293770This is what I want to know too. I&#039;ve made 150% in the past day but Im on the fence about selling. It&#039;s been slowly going down but who knows
Just got a notice that ARDR is set to pump. You&#039;re welcome.
Which exchange?
&gt;&gt;2293974Where did you get notification ?
&gt;&gt;2294002Bittrex. I have a cryptobot that notifies me when things are gonna pump. It was right about cloak so we&#039;ll see how it does on this one.
&gt;&gt;2294019i got notification there is pump coming soon but did not get coin, where did you get this cryptobot and how does he get info ?share, don&#039;t be fag
&gt;&gt;2294009The service is called cryptoping. Use my referral link if you sign up desu.https://cryptoping.tech/ico?i=17559
&gt;&gt;2294061thx bro
It looks like it&#039;s starting to pump. Thanks OP!
thanks for leaving me with bags OP
&gt;&gt;2294103That&#039;s not even possible ya faggot. Don&#039;t buy it. I don&#039;t give a shit. Was just trying to help.
&gt;&gt;2294120Is there any way to get this without BTC? Because i dont have any
&gt;&gt;2294130Nope. Just sell whatever you have to BTC.
&gt;&gt;2294120I am on few pump groups they notified there is pump starting 1 hour and 30 minutes.I am interested to compare this bot and groups info.
&gt;&gt;2293974I will wait and speculate, ive seen plenty of scams like this.Op, you are going to post few more evidences of how good this works if you want our referral
Ardor let&#039;s go bois
&gt;&gt;2294145Ugh but everything I have is on the ETH market which was a mistake I am realizing nowAnd the rates from ETH to BTC are ridiculous
&gt;&gt;2294120im just joking, friendthanks for the tip
&gt;&gt;2294163Share group pls
&gt;&gt;2294175Diversify your portfolio over time. Take your profit from ETH and put them elsewhere. Most of the altcoins are traded to BTC anyway
&gt;&gt;2294165I&#039;d appreciate the referrals. Here&#039;s a quick rundown guys.

&gt;This kills the Ethhttps://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/871263595593572353
&gt;&gt;2290368wtf is his problem
&gt;&gt;2290379(((they))) got a hold of him
What did he mean by this?
&gt;&gt;2290572he can delete your money at will
&gt;&gt;2290368eh. i think people expected this kind of centralization from eth. there are times it is useful..cancelling or repairing transactions can be useful powers to have. ofc the only problem is people abuse such powers.its up to (((them))) if they abuse it so strongly people leave eth, or if they manage it somewhat responsibly
Eh, I&#039;ll still buy at the new floor.
&gt;&gt;2290368uhh this is how proof of stake works senpaitachiif you stake it is possible you can lose your money but only if you try to fight consensus. (or something)
&gt;&gt;2290444kek confirms.Praise him!
you are now aware that ethereum is an 85% premined scamcoin with a huge extent of centralization and even a history of hard forking to recover legally obtained coins (see the DAO).sell now before vitalik and the other ethereum foundation founders gets arrested for selling unlicensed securities.You got in on a ponzi scheme at the perfect time. Sell now and hold bitcoin for security or gamble on ethereums successor (probably smart contracts that aren&#039;t turing complete so they can be mathematically verified)
This means nothing, all he&#039;s saying is if someone with a huge amount of capital (billionaire?) wanted to ruin ETH they can&#039;t just pump 51% in and take full ownership stake and do whatever they want with it.
when goyim can&#039;t understand money without a merchant
&gt;&gt;2290799&gt;99ETH confirmed as next official currency of Israel.
&gt;&gt;2290809lmao ETH shills need to get a real job.
it&#039;s a mechanism in proof of stake systems called &quot;slashing&quot; you retards
&gt;&gt;2290801Sell now goys! Uhh ethereum is going nowhere! I don&#039;t have a bid wall set up
&gt;&gt;2290958&gt;needdumb nocoiner
he can just delete the badguys money, this doesn&#039;t effect me, quick buy!
https://youtu.be/gucldeyRYJ0
&gt;&gt;2291079we can delete your money but it&#039;s a MECHANISM bro
&gt;&gt;2290725No! Creators of Coins can delete them!? That is impossible! They would have to be, like, the creators or something to do that!
simply the rollback after the 51% of the blockchain is more expensive than the revenue from it. But it&#039;s automated, no russians scammer involved
&gt;&gt;2290801Are you saying that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi-scheme?
&gt;&gt;2291362are you twelve?
&gt;&gt;2291449Coiner btfo yet again
&gt;&gt;2290809That&#039;s not what a 51% attack is. Get off my board please.
&gt;&gt;2290368&gt;Hey guys I solved the double spend problem&gt;just delete the attackers transactions!
&gt;&gt;2290809dumbass
&gt;&gt;2292722Literally what is wrong with this?
&gt;&gt;2290368why should they show sympathy towards cryptoterrorists?
&gt;&gt;2290368If the lord wills it, so be it.
&gt;&gt;2293141A lot of things
&gt;&gt;2290801&gt;gamble on ethereums successor (probably smart contracts that aren&#039;t turing complete so they can be mathematically verified)Which coins fit this description?
&gt;&gt;2290368ETC&gt;ETH flippening when?
This is why ETC is needed. No rollbacks, no bailouts with ETC.

&gt;&gt;2293141&gt;decentralized coin&gt;can be manipulated by a central authority
&gt;&gt;2293953The pos algorithm automatically deletes the stakes of dishonest nodes.How is this bad?
&gt;&gt;2293712the irony is palpablenot a single cryptocuck speculator knows how anything works, that&#039;s probably why they&#039;re all unemployed
&gt;&gt;2294004It isn&#039;t, they just want you to sell for cheap ETH
I always knew eth wasn&#039;t a genuine freedom coinfuck that centralized bullshit.

&gt;&gt;2290368ahahah this autistic fucker won&#039;t ever learn

I&#039;ve got 9 btc and 106 eth.Did I get my split right? Am I losing potential money but not not buying the right coins?
Daddy , i like , lets sexCall me pratesh_patel_69@gmail.com
&gt;&gt;2293525When did you buy? How long do you plan to hodl? With August approaching and current prices around ATH, keeping a lot of BTC is risky. ETH as well, though to less of an extent. Certainly don&#039;t expect any moonrides with either as well, that ship sales.
&gt;&gt;2293598I bought in to BTC at 600ish and I bought in to ETH at like 42ish (usdt).I&#039;ve been holding btc since 2013. I tried trading on poloniex and mtgox back in the day but I never quite get it right and tend to lose money, so I&#039;ve just been holding.Willing to hold as long as it takes to make a million. Possible?
&gt;&gt;229363350k to 1 million just hodling at this point may never happen. Basically requires that BTC and ETH increase 20-fold. You&#039;re gambling on a lot of factors if you don&#039;t take at least portions out on fiat and promising altcoins.
&gt;&gt;2293719I don&#039;t understand how people are making millions just by buying alt coins. The amount of dollars you would initially have to put in on them just seems huge to me.I guess I&#039;m just too much of a newb.
&gt;&gt;2293926Because some people are pouring tens of thousands of dollars into the coins.
&gt;&gt;2293926some people start out big while others compound a smaller amount several times.
&gt;&gt;2294013THAT&#039;S how people are getting rich on this shit? There isn&#039;t a single scrub on this board that owns that much
&gt;&gt;2293926You buy hundreds of thousands or millions of them very early, hold, then sell.
&gt;&gt;2294034/biz/ might be too rich for your blood, sorry to say
&gt;&gt;2293926&gt;&gt;&gt;2293719&gt;I don&#039;t understand how people are making millions just by buying alt coins. The amount of dollars you would initially have to put in on them just seems huge to me.&gt;I guess I&#039;m just too much of a newb.If you come first and put 100$ into some promising altcoin, you can make a lot of money because some futur newfag will want to buy it at a higher price.It&#039;s not really a ponzi, but it has some similarity.
&gt;&gt;2294034i&#039;m LMAO&#039;ing at your life
&gt;&gt;2293926I doubt many here are making millions. It&#039;s mostly dreaming.But sure, I might put $1000 into various alts and on average turn it into $5k.Some of us are making 1000s while chasing millions
&gt;&gt;2294034OP has 9 btc and 106 eth.More than $20k in each.Surely OP would not exaggerate.
Nah that seems pretty good to me, ETH&#039;s gonna moon sooner or later (perhaps gradually).(0.25btc would change my world btw)1MSH7QzZvWpKzFUWcAeJCQtCwRfbrUkTCS

Who else waiting for verification from pic related?Waiting since saturday. Pls let me in mountain jews
&gt;&gt;2292841Amerifag here, waiting for whales to fuck me overWhy the SEC gotta be such nazis
&gt;&gt;2292841How do yall know this is legit? Literally no information about Bitcoin Suisse from official Bancor channels.
What&#039;s the low down here fellas?
&gt;&gt;2292841Waiting since saturday as well. do these kikes want my fucking 10k or not???fucking elitists will NEVER let me in on the game.
Im from jewland and the only chaance you can get something from the jews is, to be a jew.Youre fucked otherwise lads.
They are receiving over 200 applicants a day for the pre-sale.. If you got an automated mail you should have a reserved spot I think.
I want this coin. Hear the IMF is funding it.
&gt;&gt;2292841I&#039;m staying in Switzerland and there literally is a Bitcoin ATM in the small town next to me, plus you can (or will soon be able to) buy/pay with BTC at every ticket machine of Switzerland&#039;s public transport.
shhhhmorons
&gt;&gt;2292949i hope you&#039;re meming. that was an old 2010 article and they just happened to choose the same name for the same reason, because of the Keynesian connection.
waiting since this morning.. feeling the fud for bitcoin suisse if you guys have been waiting since saturday.bancor have been talking about wanting to make sure BAT ico isnt repeated. they&#039;ll be announcing terms today, should be in a few hoursworst case if they dont process i&#039;ll just buy at the point of exchange add and go long for a year or two.
Also waiting since sat. Been checking my email every 10 mins at work
&gt;&gt;2292947That&#039;s a relief.&gt;&gt;2292924See plebbit ama
&gt;&gt;2293235Meant for&gt;&gt;2292896
&gt;&gt;2293205iktf. Constantly refreshing biz, blockfolio and email.
Is BANCOR worth investing in? Or is it another BAT fiasco?
&gt;&gt;2293443Fiasco? After it hit Bittrex it went up 100%
&gt;&gt;2293460So it&#039;s a quick buck token?Or is bancor something you should hodl?
&gt;&gt;2293490Hold for sure. if you can get your hands on some that is
&gt;&gt;2293443BAT was a huge success, are you nuts? It sold out almost straight away, it attracted huge investors. The only complaint people have is that they aren&#039;t getting rich on it too (except they easily could have, I bought it within an hour of it hitting the exchange $$$$). It&#039;s not a flyby night coin either, it is solid tech with huge potential which is exactly WHY it has generated so much hype, salt and profit in such a short space of time.
Bancor has been more hyped than BAT from I&#039;ve seen. Half the comments I&#039;ve read were about people shitting on the Brave browser. This one has no such weaknesses.Took me 48hrs to verify and receive address. 24hrs to get a response after sending ETH. They are incredibly busy.. 200+ applications daily.You guys that submitted on Saturday will get in. Still only 45% full.
&gt;&gt;2293693&gt;You guys that submitted on Saturday will get in. Still only 45% full.palms are sweaty, knees weak
I submitted my appplication over the weekend and havent heard back yet. just got the automated email. I have a creeping idea that investing in this now will become the best decision of my life
&gt;forgot to bring proof of address with me&gt;will have to register tomorrowreeeee
so what wallet should i use to send my eth from?
Just applied thru bitcoin suisse. Let&#039;s see if I&#039;m still in, lambros
does /biz/ have a bancor discord group?
can you get in with regular money too? i have no ETH. I live near Company maybe ill go visit them and beg them to let me in
&gt;&gt;2294048Yes you can choose Fiat transfer as well, and they&#039;ll send you an IBAN
&gt;&gt;2294079thanks lad would you think throwing in 10k would be a mistake? or will this be my ticket to the moon?
&gt;&gt;2294152it has more hype around it than BAT, and bitcoinsuisse is getting overwhelmed with applications. I guess it&#039;s a sure 5x when it hits exchanges
So they&#039;re taking 100 bucks in fees initially and then some?
&gt;&gt;2294216100 CHF fee and apparently 1.5% of what they&#039;re handling for you
&gt;&gt;2294226thanks for the answer, anon. Then I&#039;ll be waiting for the offering of bancor directly because my investment would be 100.
I signed up yesterday at BTCS for 80 ETH, I hope I get innnnnn!
Vox... you rascal.
&gt;&gt;2294187vix and vr are dead anon
The fact that VOX of all shitcoins (not to mention MUSIC) is mooning shows we&#039;re about to feel a severe correction soon.
&gt;&gt;2294200elaborate
&gt;&gt;2294251The last time EVERY coin was on a bull run, the next day was a unanimous bear run. Enjoy your short-term shitcoin profits while they last but put them into something more stable before they disappear again.
&gt;&gt;2294200This anon has no idea what he&#039;s talking about.https://twitter.com/voxelus?lang=enCEO Devcast #4 should be in the next few days. MUSIC is actually just garbage.
&gt;&gt;2294277You realize marketcap is already past the previous ATH, right? It&#039;s going to crash again down to the mid 70 billion range within the week.
&gt;&gt;2294273I hold a lot of faith in the Bilzerian Bubble Indicator
you were excited because you thought this was going to be a monero thread, and you&#039;ve been holding monero foreverinstead, this is a thread asking why the fuck monero has stagnated so bad. yes i know about fluffyfaggot&#039;s &quot;hilarious&quot; prank the other week.
&gt;&gt;2289308already sold and bought stratis
but now it doesnt even have enough volume to suggest that it&#039;s shitting the bed.... its just sitting there, totally stalled out. look at all the gaps in the graph. i havent seen such a lack of interest since 5 minutes before DIEM got delisted
Joking right? It literally doubled in a months time poor fags need not apply to real coins pls go
&gt;&gt;2289339i bought 18 months ago at $10. held through the $4 dip, and still held when it pumped last month.the difference now is that it&#039;s the volume that&#039;s tapered off
Look on the graph, the volume is always low before a surge.
lol what the hell have i just stirred up
&gt; why the fuck monero has stagnated so badmaybe people learned their lesson?
&gt;&gt;2290005&gt;people learned their lesson?Look through /biz/ and rethink.
&gt;&gt;2289308why is it not on bittrex?
&gt;&gt;2289318STRAT just took a huge dip. How does it feel, being a bagholder?
&gt;&gt;2290121Isn&#039;t there a xmr/btc pair?It&#039;s one of the main coins on polo.
i feel like ever since i made this thread, some lonely whale has taken it upon himself to heave xmr out of the ditch
Bitterponzi can fuck off with his personal pump and dump shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2290302I like the slow and steady surge of Monero. Let me sleep at night.
&gt;&gt;2290635it certainly doesnt surprise anyone in a hurry. but if i zoom out far enough, the monero graph always makes me smile
&gt;&gt;2289308I&#039;ve been on Monero since $2~ because of the legit community and technology.But lately, I&#039;ve been getting really fucking sick of the Main dev and his little bitch antics. All he fucking does is talk shit on everything, calling everything a scam. He&#039;s got serious fucking assburgers syndrome. He even got in some heat with Vitalik yesterday on twitter.Anyone got any suggestions on what to reinvest in? I might move 50% of my monero into something else.
&gt;&gt;2290913The market is overheating. His legit intention is to warn noobs.
&gt;&gt;2290005*lesson teaching intensifies*
&gt;&gt;2291201What&#039;s the damn lesson?
&gt;&gt;2291133Yeah, I understand and respect that, but man the shit talking is just soooo overwhelming.
&gt;&gt;2290913zcash has a rockstar team of cryptographers and better tech
&gt;&gt;2291273Zcash also has the unenviable record of single greatest price crash ever, with perhaps the exception of thalidomide
&gt;&gt;2291273Except that most transactions are not private, due to the &#039;better tech&#039;.
&gt;&gt;2291211a guy associated with Monero, &quot;fluffypony,&quot; hyped a big announcement on twitter and lots of people bought in anticipation. Turned out to be a joke. The guy was trying to &#039;teach people a lesson&#039; not to speculate on crypto and not to trust twitter announcements. It crashed the price. Many people believe, I included, that he and his friends took short positions and made heaps of money off of this stunt. Either way, nobody trusts monero anymore.I hope monero gets kicked out of the top ten and monero gets rejected for some other coin by dark markets. Also I hope fluffypony and monero is forever associated with this scam
&gt;&gt;2291297that&#039;s entirely optional, still better tech, still more private, still HOLY SHIT cryptographer team&gt;he isn&#039;t a crypto nerd
&gt;&gt;2291292who gives a fuck? that was an artifact of the mining curve
blame this fat faggotWhy would you buy into a coin where the lead dev purposely fucks with the price? I don&#039;t even care if you&#039;re holding long term, I don&#039;t want to be in business with an unstable faggot.
&gt;&gt;2291340I&#039;d say a lot of people &quot;give a fuck&quot;. Anyone who bought those early coins from $2500 alllllllll the way down to whatever it crashed to, probably aren&#039;t too enamoured with your superstar dev team
&gt;&gt;2291342&gt;fatty devdisgusting.
&gt;&gt;2291299Oh man that is hilariousWhat he did probably wasn&#039;t right, but man I wish /biz/ would learn that lesson already, I can&#039;t hate him.The annoying part is lots of those people probably did not learn their lesson.
&gt;&gt;2291363they were retards for buying a coin at an absurd price without looking up the production curvethere were no secrets, there were dumps, they were just fucking retards
&gt;&gt;2291396The lesson most people walked away with was &quot;fuck the monero dev&quot;, unfortunatelyI dunno if he made any money off it but I personally think he was getting a bit salty watching every single other coin get pumped up, XMR was kind of conspicuously lagging behind
I bought Monero last year and held until that fat fuck showed everyone that he is shady as hell.
I&#039;m mining monero and too lazy to switch to eth
&gt;&gt;2291441I feel like it was just bad timing on his part. Didn&#039;t all cryptocurrencies have some kind of peak around the same time?
&gt;&gt;2290913Are you from /lit/?
I traded all my monero gains for bitbean, no ragrets.
Looks like its time to buy monero if this thread is anything to go by
&gt;&gt;2289308&gt;&gt;2289308&gt;why the fuck monero has stagnated so badThis is the perfect time to buy.learn2anticyclicallytrading
&gt;&gt;2290913&gt;&gt;2292172&gt;tfw /lit/ is in on crypto&gt;tfw you guys are probably scheming on writing interesting modern cyberpunk chic stories for fast commercial success right now&gt;tfw I am a slow writerI avoid Monero because way too much of the smart money right now is based on investing in strong devs and the team behind Monero seems unprofessional. Simple, boring explanation but you know that it is true.
&gt;&gt;2292237ThisAlso buy Sia and Golem
&gt;&gt;2292246&gt;unprofessionalIt&#039;s literally one of the biggest projects on GitHub. Fluffypony is a little kid but the rest of the team is A+.
&gt;&gt;2292327Fuck Golem. GNT hasn&#039;t moved like forever. Better off using your money to ride the Shitcoins waves.Sold my gnt yesterday at a loss and what do you know, the price is still what it was yesterday.Earned back my losses thanks to xby.
&gt;&gt;2289308Prediction: Monero will slowly die since there are much better alternatives. Monero isn&#039;t as anonymous as you may think, nor is zcash. There will be a bigger player that will destroy zcash and monero.
&gt;&gt;2289308&gt;not buying verge and dopecoin
&gt;&gt;2291211&gt;What&#039;s the damn lesson?dont buy monero
&gt;&gt;2292548Speculation.
&gt;&gt;2290913&gt;Anyone got any suggestions on what to reinvest in? I might move 50% of my monero into something else.WHAT IF WE USED OUR MONERO TO PUT A BOUNTY ON FLUFFY PONY
&gt;&gt;2292237&gt;&gt;2292237at worst it&#039;s a long term hold. Don&#039;t know about you but i need a coin for long term wealth storage. LTC, ETH and BTC, although the biggest, are way to volatile and their future is unsure thanks to hardforks waiting to happen
&gt;&gt;2289308Sell your monero and get some waves son
&gt;&gt;2289308When Monero pumps, it&#039;s going to pump so fucking hard. It&#039;s going to be August 2016 all over again.Smart money is holding this down artificially and accumulating it with all their PnD gains. Look at the lending rate for xmr. Completely unnatural.When the last Bitcoin has been squeezed out of every shitcoin the Monero rocketship will be fully loaded and once it leaves the launchpad you&#039;ll have to pay Musk $500 mil to organize a rendezvous on Mars.
&gt;&gt;2289308They are getting sued by visa.
&gt;&gt;2290913Most things are a scam tho. And fluffy may be an autist, but that has a certain appeal. His leadership is unique. When hodling cryptos I look for something unique.
watching html5 and MOON walls going up and down, thinking about buying into esper, what are your thoughts on the best investment /biz/?
&gt;&gt;2293777looks like it might explode senpaiim going in
&gt;&gt;2293777they are still in an alpha stage, so buy now and kind of forget about it for a year. at least thats what i&#039;m doing
It&#039;s an absolute shit pajeet coin
&gt;&gt;2293851so 500% gains in two weeks?
are they all pajeet though, do you reckon?
bought and going to hold forever, the price should rise up as soon as it gets added to Livecoin, and possibly Bittrex in the near future.
&gt;&gt;2293777there is other shitcoin in the game KIDSall are high risk high reward
&gt;&gt;2293777With 4 satoshi, the price can only go up.And look at that weak sell wall... and compare it to mooncoin lol.This one will be VERY EASY to beak, 300-500% gain easy with this.
Buy now and hodl. It&#039;ll reach 100 sat easily by this time next year
best exchanges with this shit?
&gt;&gt;2293777where is this shitcoin?is this the esp for 1 sat on yobit?
&gt;&gt;2294164Novaexchange&gt;&gt;2294188DO NOT BUY esp from yobit. That is the old chain and yobit refuse to swap to the new chain. Basically, yobit let dead coin sitting there to be purchased by their customer.
&gt;&gt;2294205&gt;DO NOT BUY esp from yobit. That is the old chain and yobit refuse to swap to the new chain.Yeah, I thought it&#039;s highly suspicious for a coin that&#039;s being shilled that much to have no volume and movement.It&#039;s pretty deceptive on Yobit&#039;s part to have the old chain listed.
&gt;&gt;2294280yobit is a shitty exchange, and their support sucksbut their UI is far far better than polo and bittrex in my opinion
&gt;&gt;2294301&gt;but their UI is far far better than polo and bittrex in my opinionHope you nigger joking on this part.
I thought you guys deserve to know about this before it goes up. It has a super low marketcap, very likely candidate for a pump in the near future. Some prominent names in $CRYPTO have been stacking up on it too.Moving to PoS pretty soon, almost no one wants to sell so it might be difficult to buy.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/netko/https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange?market=NETKO_BTC
&gt; $249,242 market capThis and VOX = Hail Mary 2017
&gt;&gt;2294056Why VOX? Much higher mcap too.
&gt;&gt;2294192Just personal choices. VOX could be absolute shit, but it&#039;s .06c at the moment, and the CEO is boasting the coin will be &quot;Top 15&quot;. I put in like $50, may as well see if he keeps his word.
&gt;&gt;2294208Looking at the chart now it seems decent, probably gonna get some actually. Thanks anon.
It&#039;s a scam. Don&#039;t bother.
&gt;&gt;2294265You mind giving proof or are you trying to fud it because your bids still aren&#039;t filled?I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s legit top 10 material, just that it&#039;s a good shitcoin and likely to be pumped.
I love the idea. it kinda aligns with the new crypto-anarchism buzzword. What do you guys think of it? Potentially revolutionary? What are your opinions on their team and progress? What about their new application Boardwalk coming out on the 15th? Discuss.
Bump for interest
I would throw some money into it if bittrex would fucking reactivate my accountREEEEEE
the website / wallet is really cool.
&gt;&gt;2290877yea their wallet is nice. Boardwalk though, it sounds so amazing, is it too good to be true?
&gt;&gt;2290870https://changelly.com/exchange/BTC/SWT/1?ref_id=coinmarketcapuse this and you will get some
&gt;&gt;2290870Why did they deactivate your account?
&gt;&gt;2290901what is boardwalk
&gt;&gt;2290936https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-boardwalk-overview-9a362f19411fRead that. It&#039;s, in my opinion, a way to decentralize an entire buyer/seller economy with reputation similar to ebay feedback. Its interesting though.
&gt;&gt;2290787Yup, I&#039;m going to be shilling the shit out of this near the 15th. It&#039;s THE coin that I&#039;ve actually felt excited about, in that I can see NORMIES using this. The hashtagging bollocks goes fantastic towards all the hipsters.
&gt;&gt;2290933Someone else logged into it so I locked it. Changed password and added two factor authentication. And they still are taking forever to process my ticket and reactivate.
&gt;&gt;2290976Exactly, it implents normies twitter hash tagging love into an actually good idea. Its made for the masses to use.
&gt;were gonna compete in established markets with giant corps with a dog shit product with poor usability&#039;no&#039;
&gt;&gt;2290962so its adding a hashtag market. Sweet!
&gt;&gt;2290787&gt;hashtag memes: the coinlel
good video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xljDR4yDd4c
&gt;&gt;2291184just finished the vid, it makes me even more excited.
Aight fuck it guys, i like this project too much to not help out. bought in
&gt;&gt;2290787why not just use your credit card to pay for these transactions? It seems like they are adding an unnecessary step with converting your money into SWT.
&gt;&gt;2291390Cool. It&#039;s just beginning and really only good things seem to be in store from here. The trading may be volatile since it has low liquidity right now, so best to just focus on the project and don&#039;t pay too much to the daily price action.
&gt;&gt;2291417why not just use fiat instead of bitcoin?
&gt;&gt;2291424yea definaterly gonna be a long term hold for me. Its going to be a nice bump on the 15th when Boardwalk is presented though.
Oops sorry wrong thread
&gt;&gt;2291446this app has no pros for consumers. Whats the point of losing your protection of being able to reverse credit card purchases if you get scammed. All you can do in Swarm city is give them bad reputation points, you can&#039;t get your SWT coins back
&gt;&gt;2291475Fuck off shit coin, this is a discussion thread.
&gt;&gt;2291490They mentioned that both parties will have skin in the game before their trade completes and if the item/service isnt as described the seller loses rep.
&gt;&gt;2291490and the money
&gt;&gt;2291522Yea, this is a well thought out project. This isn&#039;t an excuse to create a coin and scam people. Eventually people will realize this.
Should I sell at loss my XLM for this SWeeT thing?
&gt;&gt;2291590do what you want, no one else should be your investor but you
Maybe this is too general of a question for this thread but why do tokens (Swarm City being a perfect example) build their tech with tokens on top of Etherium rather than just their own system (without Etherium)? What&#039;s the point of being another token on top of Etherium? And if you&#039;re going to do what Swarm City in particular is doing, why not do it directly with Etherium instead of tokens? I don&#039;t really get the point of tokens on top of other brand&#039;s blockchains.
&gt;&gt;2291671It is using Ethereum as the backbone of the SC system. It can be done without Ethereum, but that would take more time than just using ready made system.
&gt;&gt;2291671For more ERC20 Tokens it is so that the incentives of the developers lie with the product they are pushing. After all why would someone do something for free? Sure someone might want to port it over to ETH but that is a lot of work and if someone codes in a &quot;fee&quot; you can just code it out. If it is closed source no one will use it.Tokens however make it frictionless cost for the users (maybe a bit more gas?) but the Devs still win. This is for ICO&#039;s in general.
&gt;&gt;2290787Looks pretty good. Sold some DGB to some of this as I noticed it&#039;s slowly rising up.
EAT THE DIP BOYS
&gt;&gt;2292451WHEN IS THE DIP COMING!?
&gt;&gt;2292604Right now. Get in or risk being left behind.
&gt;&gt;2290787Where do you store it?Adresses are quite complicated bc there used to be another company and i dont know whats happening
Might dip soon, but will double again june 15 when Boardwalk is released.Got in at 120000 sats and will be holding. This is a coin for the long run.Info on Boardwalk:&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Np3lss_XRM
It&#039;s fucking stupid. What are the applications? You have shit like uber, lyft, task rabbit, postmates, arrow, etc. There&#039;s an app for everything this would be useful for.cool idea, but 0/10 commercial viability.
&gt;&gt;2292769Alright, dumbfuck. If these people who live on the same fucking planet as you, really thought there was no viability, do you really think they&#039;d be so passionate? Use your fucking brain.
IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY GAINFUL&gt;FOR YOU
last chance to get in on XVG, faggotsbuy this fucking dip before you kys next month
i don&#039;t need to get ini&#039;m alreadyBALLSDEEP

I hate scammers like this, but that&#039;s the free market so what can you do.It&#039;s preposterous that people shill for a coin that gained, what, 1000% or more I don&#039;t know, in past few days.How dumb and greedy do people get?It&#039;s done. If you were in early - CONGRATS.If not - find another pumpcoin.Fuckin disgusting making people buy at ATH. Verge ain&#039;t goin anywhere.
&gt;&gt;2293428someone&#039;s mad they didn&#039;t buy sooner.buy now fuckhead
&gt;&gt;2293340HO-LYFUCK, NICE
&gt;&gt;2293438Why THE FUCK would I buy on a pump I missed lmao
&gt;&gt;2293428did you sell DGB as it was mooning too?If you think this coins dead you won&#039;t make it.
&gt;&gt;2293340&gt;balls deepThat&#039;s cool.t. 90k XVG holder who got in when someanon was wanting to pump and dump it. Got in at 15sats.
&gt;&gt;2293450It&#039;s going to 500-1000 sats by the end of June. You probably didn&#039;t buy DGB at 300 sats, or 600 sats, or 900 sats.
&gt;&gt;2293340PLS DONT FUCKING DUMP ALL AT ONCE
&gt;&gt;2293340but seriously what are your expectatons for xvg, what made you go balls deep?What do you know man?? Should I sell or buy?? sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit
What the hell going on with that shit ?literally pump n dump ?
wtf going on checl book order
&gt;&gt;2293360seeing it at like 24k, watching a youtube video and coming back to see it at like 90k.Wtf
&gt;&gt;2293411yeah was moving between 500% to 1500 % every 5 seconds kek
i made 100 euros out of it yesterday if i would keep it overnight i could sell it for around 2k fml
&gt;&gt;2293522why was your reason in the first place to put money on ?feeling ?never heard about this shit coin ever, not even on /biz/
Holy shit man I can&#039;t believe it. Should we buy boys
&gt;&gt;2293559i dont know, it look like it going down and all the whale already sold, i see a guys traped with 63 worth of btc in the last ask book order,rip to him ithink
&gt;&gt;2293547I just made 144 euros.. here&#039;s the storyI joined a pnd group on slack a while ago, last week they tried pumping it, didn&#039;t really succeed because some neets sold too quickly.I bought some and decided to hold.I actually had to check if I was tripping or not when I saw the price rise 1000%+ today haha.
&gt;&gt;2293559&gt;buying after a 1500% pumpYeah definitely m8, what could go wrong?
earlier today i saw the price moving and thought it was just a tiny pump. didn&#039;t think it&#039;d go up 10000%
im up $70 rn, just watch the whale orders and sell accordingly, follow their movements and its easy to make gains
&gt;&gt;2293559&gt;Literally pump and dump example as is&gt;Should i buy
&gt;&gt;2293632if he times it right and is conservative its pretty easy to make profits brah
What the fuck happened?
&gt;&gt;2293547I saw it as top earning on bitrex when it was around 70% or something up and then i played it smart selling tips buying dips and made 100 from 50 then sold and went to sleep just to wake up and see the massive pump
&gt;&gt;2293703pump &amp; dump .. that&#039;s it I guess.I did make a thread right before the huge pump started. But I doubt that was the trigger.
I mistakenly brought 3500 of them at 4700 (I only wanted to buy a tiny amount, like 500)Kill me.
&gt;&gt;2293732isn&#039;t that a good thing? unless you meant 47000
&gt;&gt;2293732&gt;&gt;2293741lmao youd be stoked if it was a 4700, dont sell yet goy, hold on
&gt;&gt;2293741yeah 47000.Just sold it for 47050 to get that money out again.
wonder how long this activity can last, thinking of leaving $50 in overnight and hoping for the best
Where&#039;s the group that&#039;s pumping this coin? I want in on the dosh.
/DGB SHILL GENERAL/&gt;Discord: https://discord.gg/zBzdSMkBuy now before the $1-$10 mark. You heard it here. You have no reason to be poor.WE DID IT!!!!!!!!! 2K SATS!!!!!!!!!!!DGB Twitter&gt;https://twitter.com/digibytecoinWhat is DGB? How can I learn more?&gt;https://www.digibyte.co/&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/&gt;https://twitter.com/DigiByteCoinHow to Buy DGB Coin&gt;Sign up on Coinbase, Bittrex (recommended option) or Poloniex and VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNTS FULLY BEFORE ANYTHING&gt;Buy BTC. You can do this anywhere, but my recommendation is through Coinbase credit card. If coinbase gives you trouble, then I recommend buy.bitcoin.com if you want it as quickly as possible and you&#039;re new. They charge a high fee, but will give you your bitcoin in around 9 hours (guaranteed less than 24 hours).&gt;Send the BTC to your Bittrex or Poloniex account&gt;Buy (and hold) DGB with BTCShilling DGB to popular streamers and youtubers&gt;inb4 DGB doesn&#039;t need shilled!This is different than pump and dumps. DGB is obviously only going to continue rising, but if we get notoriety from a famous streamer or youtuber, it&#039;s lambos for everyone.Twitter Shilling&gt;Make a twitter account&gt;Make tweets about DGB or cryptocurrency in general&gt;Make tweets about why DGB is better than BTC&gt;Make tweets about DGB and its potential in the video game world&gt;Retweet DGB related material&gt;Tweet @ famous Minecraft or LoL streamers&gt;Hashtags: #dgb #dgbcoin #digibyte #digibytecoinList of Streamer Twitters&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWMZeuBcwWy0pgOc6t-8DgD11khdA89bpbW7DBsOo1A/edit?usp=sharingIf you know of other ways to get in contact with popular people, do so with the previously described methods. Once we get one big person on board, it&#039;ll start a chain reaction.And remember, ignore the FUDs, buy the dips and hold. See you all in lambo land.
Remember when it dipped from 600 to 400 and the FUDs said DGB is finished?haha good times.
...Day 4Time and time again DGB has risen, giving a strong, powerful erection each time, but time is running out. I will hold the coin no matter what. It is all I have now.
DGB is done. Buy VTR instead
where do you think this coin will be in a year phams?
&gt;&gt;229180210$ per coin
&gt;&gt;2291801VTR is literal shitcoin. I would rather buy something called PoopCoin with no product
&gt;&gt;2291799We&#039;re all gonna make it brah
The accumulation will soon be finished.
I&#039;ve put an order to sell 2000 when it hits 10K for 0.2 BTC. Am I going to regret it?
&gt;&gt;229180250 cents in a couple of months. $1 by Christmas at least
&gt;&gt;2291823Yes, hodl
&gt;&gt;2291806I am developing PoopCoin, literally. Unbelievable.
&gt;&gt;2291833I got burnt before for ignoring advice on DGB before, so i&#039;m going to cancel this order.We&#039;re gonna make it brah
&gt;&gt;2291843When is the Initial Poop OfferingCount me in
&gt;&gt;2291847Hold fast. Nerves of steel man.
tfw poor so i only have 456 digibyteswhy cant i be like the rich anons and have 50k of them
&gt;&gt;2291977It&#039;s not about the amount, it&#039;s about the return on your investment.
&gt;&gt;2291992yeah but someone with 50k will make a lot more than someone with 456i just want to see mad massive gains and lamboland
&gt;&gt;2292002Sell the highs and buy the lows. Only way for you to make it with so few.
&gt;&gt;2292002You can probably sell at the next high and put that money into a low sat coin to get more out of it

what are we watching todayplease respond
CYTR had fantastic news, don&#039;t panic sell like the fags that read that bullshit seeking alpha article
&gt;&gt;2294249always do the opposite of what seeking alpha says
INVT3x regular volume on Friday with strong price movement into close. Looks like it has another run in it. This is a blind gamble momentum play. Meme at your own risk and always exercise caution, lads.
Well boys, who jumped in @ .40 when I told you guys about it?&gt;Currently 1.21
Still waiting on a bitcoin transfer into bittrex. Been over 24 hours now.
&gt;&gt;2287937RIP bro&gt;Double Top about to form
&gt;&gt;2287937fucking hate bittrex and their slow bullshit
&gt;&gt;2288170But its more stable than fucking Polo
Where are my IOC niggas
&gt;&gt;2289188hodling
&gt;&gt;2289209Staking nigga
Bamp
&gt;&gt;2287577if you told me about it 3 months ago, then i did. i think it was around 40c when i bought it, maybe a little less.i don&#039;t have a huge holding, just a few hundred $ when i bought in, but i will hold long term as it is making gains.
&gt;&gt;2291128I did hehehe... DIONs is coming man.Finally made 1 IOC staking. Wew
&gt;&gt;2291164in that case, thanks dude. it was a good shout.
&gt;&gt;2291243No biggie, just passing it on.My projection: $5 IOC by the end of september
Who hodling and staking?
&gt;&gt;2291898I&#039;m holding. I smell money to be made.
Bamp
In at 37K50x profit in the next 6 month, because:- DIONS project- CHAMELEON project- IBM partnership
&gt;&gt;2292871Muh nigga. My initial was at 35k. Been hodling ever since.This has literal $10 potential. Plus staking for it is miles ahead of the other coins. Makes my dick hard.Tho i find it funny that Joel has a disdain for Vitilak
&gt;&gt;2292885$10 is a matter of time, with big business and enterprise adoption, this coin should have $500,000,000 market cap and that&#039;s conservative prediction.
&gt;&gt;2293017Im surprised this wasn&#039;t shilled harder on biz... well more for us
Shit...I only got .1 BTC at 33k...worth getting more?
&gt;&gt;2293647Yes. You could wait for a decent opening possibly 1.40 ish, but ya catch the train

What are you going to inherit?A significant sum or real estate?Will it change your life and what do you plan doing with it?
&gt;&gt;2293998my grandparents left me a mutual fund if 10k...thats it
&gt;&gt;2293998Grandma left me a quilt. Never knew the rest of my grandparents.Pretty sure dads going to blow all his money before giving it to a son he adopted.I&#039;ll probably be supporting my mom in like 5 years.It&#039;s crypto or bust nigga.
A percentage from the sale of my uncle&#039;s apartment. I miss him. I hope to pay off my student debt.
&gt;&gt;2294037iktf
will not inherit anything until my mid or late 50s. im 30 now
&gt;tfw my mum has about 500k in loans through her business secured against her house because the banks are such jews they wouldn&#039;t give her LLC a loan unless she put up her house as collateral&gt;tfw she used to have 1 million in life insurance but now the fucking insurance company won&#039;t let her take out a policy because she had a melanoma removed a few years ago&gt;tfw my grandfather was a multimillionaire but all the money is fucking gone because he had 9 kids and his wife threw his money down the drainMy inheritance prospects have justed themselves quite nicely, meanwhile my half sister has an unmarried aunt with 3 houses who smokes a pack a day and is leaving everything to her
My grandmother has 30,000 in her will for me. Use about 15 of that to get rid of the pmi on my mortgage. Replace a few windows and dump the rest into an investment/emergency fund.It won&#039;t fundamentally change my life, and I&#039;d prefer my grandmother not to die for a long time, but it will be useful.
&gt;&gt;2293998nothing, everything i have, i earned it myself.It will be really nice but i dont expect to receive free money from anyone.I will earn my own things like a real man. And i will be proud of it.Plus if you do not know how to manage money, you are not going anywhere with your inheritance
&gt;&gt;2294037This, my parents are poor. Best I can hope for is a couple of acres of land that nobody wants in Mississippi
&gt;&gt;2294082I also earned everything I have myself.But my parents supported me as I went to university. So I guess that does not count a completely self-sufficient.Maybe I will inherit a few 10k. But I don&#039;t count on it.
How often do you think of quitting your job?&gt;Every damn day
&gt;implying I have a job
maybe start with working less hours?
I don&#039;t, because it&#039;s an enjoyable way to earn pocket money while investing in shitcoins.
Never had a proper job, all under the table. (plus all the dressup and resume shilling is annoying bullshit)My current one is a remote job thats pretty easy, and all that money goes right into crypto.
&gt;&gt;2294278Probably should. I&#039;m an insurance agent at an &quot;Independent office&quot; and maybe I&#039;m just sick of cold call sales.
We are going to 2k sats today, the LAUNCH is startingITS THE SECOND COMINGGET IN or you will KYS yourself in few days
&gt; Current MarketCap - $1,462,772&gt; 31,500,000 Circulating Supply&gt; App released on Google Play last week&gt; Quietly Gaining Traction&gt; Weekly Video Dev UpdatesDon&#039;t say I never did anything for you.
shit coin, it was just pumped and dumped 2 weeks ago
&gt;&gt;2292765And? The developers have become crazy involved with the project lately, and a P&amp;D surrounding the news of their app being released means nothing.Buy the rumor sell the news is all I see on their chart. Nowhere left to go but up!
&gt;&gt;2292781The app is shit
&gt;&gt;2292765Also, the coin has only been around on bittrex for a matter of weeks; Once the app gains traction and the developers/CEO continue revealing upcoming news in their devcasts, the price will sky rocket.Screen cap this. This will explode soon.
&gt;&gt;2292802The app is shit?! It literally allows for Unreal-Engine level models and assets to be imported to their marketplace for use by the world. It allows 3D Modelers and artists a new revenue stream based directly in a VR space, and that&#039;s not even taking into account the actual GAMES that will be made with it.The future is bright for this coin.
Shitcoin.Buy music.Got cucked hard on this app release
This is literally the shittiest of shitcoins. It is &#039;proof of work&#039; yet they actively discourage you from mining. There can only be 1 node (theirs). i.e. This is not even a real crypto.Retards who buy this really get their just deserts.
OMG not this shitcoin again!!! The developers dump there bags on every pump why the fuck would anyone buy this? Can&#039;t you guys see the charts look at what they do every time it&#039;s pumped!!
&gt;&gt;2292752go fuck your mother with this absolute shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2293434&gt;&gt;2293458&gt; You, a month from now&quot;Wow, I sure wish I had bought that Voxelus shitcoin when it was only $0.05. Shitcoin or not, its market cap is 20million and the coin is worth a dollar&quot;&gt; You then kill yourself
&gt;&gt;2293510the exact same type of thread made me buy this piece of shit at 3500 then the whales dumped on meyoure doing the same thing nowkill yourself retard
&gt;&gt;2292752I&#039;m already in and loaded.&gt;b-but muh shitcoinYou fools fail to realize that FUD and scandals are the best opportunities to get into any crypto or stock because the price gets exceptionally low. There has never have been a successful coin without it&#039;s low moments
&gt;&gt;2293532Denying the potential of a coin with a $1.6mil market cap in this wet dream of a pump market doesn&#039;t even make sense to me. RDD is sitting at a $92.1mil cap, and the first post on their reddit when that shit started floating around was&quot;Is this coin dead?&quot;&gt; kys
&gt;&gt;2293585rdd has a much more ambitious project than voxvox is literally shit
&gt;&gt;2293585and of course, you advertise it after your group pumped itkill yourself nigger
&gt;Not buying verge
&gt;&gt;2293864&gt; RDD&gt; More AmbitiousThat coin is &quot;literally&quot; garbage covered in dog shit. It has &quot;literally&quot; nothing going for it except REDD-ID, which the tip bot on reddit ALREADY does better than it.Also, FUD all you want, if VOX hit RDD market cap levels, that would be a 100x increase, so kys.
DO NOT BUY THIS COINI REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS COINIT HAS BEEN PUMPED BY A SMALL GROUP OF WHALES TRYING TO SYPHON MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKETSASK YOURSELF WHY THE OP HAS CREATED THIS THREAD AFTER THE COIN WAS PUMPEDTHIS IS A SCAM
&gt;&gt;2293872I don&#039;t have a group, cockholster. I stumbled upon this a week ago and bought the dip. Nowhere to go but up, and feel all of these XVG, RDD, MOON, DGB, and Bitbean have already passed the point of getting rich off of.I&#039;m just trying to help you guys help me by helping yourselves help one another.Kys.
&gt;&gt;2293894No one wants to buy your shitcoin faggot
&gt;&gt;2293884&gt;&gt;2293902Damn, you FUD hard. I&#039;m not even trying to shill this, which is the funny part. This shit is .05c, and has a market cap of 1.6mil.....I like money, but apparently you don&#039;t have the wellfare of the whole of /biz/ in your best interest or you wouldnt have revived this dead thread. Assholes.
&gt;&gt;2293916IT HAS BEEN PUMPED ALREADYYOURE TELLING PEOPLE TO BUY THE ATHIT WONT WORK ON ME THIS TIME YOU MOTHER FUCKER
&gt;&gt;2293933That wasn&#039;t a pump.... The app dropped, and it was a hype spike, which is obvious to anyone that doesn&#039;t have to use caps lock to communicate online.Buy it or don&#039;t, coins with active devs typically continue to rise, and if they keep up the weekly devcasts, you stand to lose more the longer you stay out.You do you, my friend.4Chan Terms - You&#039;re a huge faggot, and you are obviously more wrong than your original conception, which was the most colossal fuck up your mother has ever been a part of.
&gt;&gt;2293959the app dropped last week and the only effect it had was A FUCKING DUMP
&gt;&gt;2293976&gt; Buy the rumor, sell the newsWelcome to /biz/.You must be new here. Come June 9th, DGBs chart will look the same, if not worse.
&gt;&gt;2293981youre a faggot, your previous post tried to justify this new pump with the app releaseno one is going to buy your bags, nigger
&gt;&gt;2293999I don&#039;t have bags. I do own about $300 worth, but I could give a rats ass if this plummeted tomorrow. Made like 5 grand off Stratis this week, so the performance or lack-there-of of this coin isn&#039;t causing me any grief.
&gt;&gt;2293864&gt;shilling a plebbit coin&gt;on 4chanNormies need to leave
went BALLSDEEP into stratis anons DONT MEME ME....pls
Dude.... I was thinking of pulling out from STRAT.Bought in at ath and now it&#039;s basically dead.This coin is just pure shrilling.
&gt;&gt;2294214Shoulda held for Bancor. I&#039;ll send a postcard from pluto
&gt;&gt;2294238you bought highnow all you gotta do is sell low
&gt;&gt;2294238When the hell will you people realize buying ATH is the most retarded thing you can possibly do.
I got problem why it shows just 0.07 ? not the other digits ? like 0.07xxxxxxx ?
not sure, but it shows the same for me to.
&gt;estimated value
&gt;&gt;2294198I noticed that, too. kinda frustrating desu
bittrex rounds down and pockets the change
&gt;&gt;2294218This. Yall niggas retarded
&gt;&gt;2294198but this is in normal why it cant count these and put them into est ??
Best option for purchasing BTC with a credit card besides Coinbase? I would just use Coinbase but it says that I have to wait foe my foeat deposit (bank xfer) to go through before adding any more. I want to buy several altcoins and really don&#039;t want to have to wait until Friday when my bank transfer goes through. Thanks Biz!!
I also have a roadblock when it comes to sites that verify with a driver&#039;s license. My state has the shitiest laminate on their IDs and it is peeling over my picture. A few sites have denied me because of this. I did get Bitstamp to verify with my passport, but I would rather not pay a $40 fee for $500 worth of BTC.
Shameless bump. I need to get on that XVG rocket!
Last try before I start sucking dicks outside of my local internet cafe for BTC transfers.
&gt;&gt;2293678Bring some mouthwash
I will if it comes to that. I am thinking about just paying these Jews from Bitstamp their ridiculous fee. I want that Verge.
Come on my nigs... after all we have been through? Help a crypto-curious brother out.
Last try for real this time.Plz respond.
Stay poor faggot
&gt;&gt;2293939Suck a dick fuckface.
bitstamp, coin corner
&gt;read /biz/ for an hour&gt;decide to invest&gt;buy whatever threads are hot&gt;no idea what the coin im buying is&gt;no idea what the charts or lingo mean&gt;only up 600% this week
Well glad to see threads like this. It really work! When it ends? Can it be more then one month or so?
Anon where do I buy coins? US anon here, is it safe to buy using credit card?
friendly tip
&gt;&gt;2293954coinbase, and yes its safe.
Fucking moron, you deserve to get burnedt. Actually researches shit and only 35% a week
&gt;&gt;2294049how do you enjoy watching shitcoin like MOON mooning?
&gt;&gt;2293911Feels good living on the future.
&gt;&gt;2293911Just remember this is a bull market for all cryptos. You&#039;re just lucky. Make sure you take profit, at least your initial capital. At some point there will be a downtrend.
Did the same thing, 1000% roi at the moment. Going to open a business soon with all my meme money
What do i do? Hodl or sell and invest in something else? Started out with $133
Trade at Bittrex. I had $260 on ETH, now on DGB.
&gt;&gt;2294109I do trade on bittrex. :)
&gt;&gt;2294104When do you start?
sell all of your shitcoins and go all in on BANCOR
&gt;&gt;22941232 days ago
BITBEAN BROTHER! NICE!
&gt;&gt;2294134Fuck i start with same amount of money and just make 4% plus. I have 132.95 and now 136. What&#039;s wrong with me.Congratz then.
&gt;&gt;2294169I would have more but I panic sold VGX right before it mooned. :( Regrets.
&gt;&gt;2294185Lol, but you learn by it something and when other coin mooned u do know what&#039;s goin on and how it worked, it&#039;s just been a lesson to you. Same problem, buy DGB and then sold and then buy again when it cost 2500 and still cant sold and lost so much to me.
&gt;&gt;2294227Yeah, it is hard to get into it. This board helps a lot though.
hey guys anyone knows a website like coinbase? where i can purchase different crypto..coinbase is not supported in my country.please help
Bittrex
Gemini
With just a month for the launch of Q3 the price will atleast double your investments.Don&#039;t miss this one out and buy NXT and Ardor!https://nxt.org/roadmap/https://nxt.org/ardor-roadmap/https://www.jelurida.com/ardor-roadmaphttp://nxtwiki.org/wiki/Whitepaper:Nxthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1518497.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=587007.0
&gt;Rent a 4 or 5 bedroom in a central area where students and young workers live&gt;Furnish it, set up power and internet, make it look nice and be ready to walk into and live&gt;sublet the rooms out individually&gt;$$$$$$$$$$$$Not sure what the laws are in other countries, but a guy I live with started doing this a year ago, and I started talking to him about it and showing interest about 6 months ago and now he employs me to manage the business. We make about $250/week per house and have 15 houses at the momentAll you need is a drivers license, a tiny bit of money to pay the bond, buy the furniture, general costs etc, and xero and pocketrent, two really easy to use programs to manage it all. I&#039;ve stopped working for him and am just starting doing it myself now because of a dispute about how much he was paying me. I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like in other countries in terms of the culture around sharing houses, and legally if this is allowed, but in Australia it is a fucking goldmine that requires very little money to get started
I&#039;m interested.But you&#039;re just renting the houses right? Then renting out individual rooms?Do the actual homeowners know about that?
In America it&#039;s tricky because we have a lot of minorities that will destroy property and/or sue with discrimination claims if you choose not to rent to them.
Lol that&#039;s sub-letting and you&#039;ll get fucking reamed for doing it
&gt;&gt;2292788250 a week.keki make this every day with coins.are u even trying?
&gt;&gt;2292810Yep exactly. The real estates and landlord know about it and are fine with it&gt;&gt;2292832Yeah wasn&#039;t sure how this would work in other countries&gt;&gt;2292853It&#039;s legal and works well in aus&gt;&gt;2293022Multiply that by 15. Also theres risk in coin trading and this is stable as fuck
&gt;&gt;2292832Same in the UKMy uncle was in renting for about 40 years but is out now due to niggers just smashing everything
Redpill me on this stuff...Is Bancor gonna moon?
&gt;&gt;2283395Possibly
IS it gonna moon? Yes, no doubt.Are you gonna be able to beat out whales and actually buy into the ICO? Hell fucking no lmaoJust hope you can buy in early enough once it hits the exchanges and still make a decent profit.
yes
No highly hyped ICO has ever lost money since launch:https://icostats.com/roi-since-ico
Who the hell needs Bancor when you can have ARK?
Anyone else afraid to miss the opportunity to buy in @ Bitcoin Suisse? I dont want to sell my other bags for funds just yet
&gt;&gt;2283578Idiot. In most cases it would have been beneficial to just keep your money in ethereum.
&gt;&gt;2284069&gt;sorting it and looking at it like a moronKYS
&gt;&gt;2283731They aren&#039;t competitors; in fact, they&#039;re friendly towards each other
&gt;&gt;2283405&gt;&gt;2283395anybody have ideas on which exchanges will be listing it first?
&gt;&gt;2283988wish i could but its non-US only..
&gt;&gt;2284212liqui.io generally has ICO up fastest
what date will it be on an exchange?
Bancor is Jewish so it will be big.http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech/At-TEDx-in-Tel-Aviv-talk-of-advancing-crypto-currencies-like-Bitcoin-479559
Will the ico be different from BAT?I mean BAT said where to send everything before the ICO, not the moment it started so people obviously prepared. Will bancor do the same?
&gt;&gt;2284563probably
Unless you&#039;re a whale who can spend &gt;$3000 on gas during the ICO, this will disappear in under 30 seconds again, and you&#039;ll be buying at 6x the price on Bittrex. ICOs are not for those with under five figures to throw around.
&gt;&gt;2283395&gt;look into Bancor&gt;see the dev team is Israeli&gt;lose all interest in it
&gt;&gt;2285009Anon...Jews never lose at money. Not investing is a guaranteed way to stay poor.
&gt;&gt;2285029&quot;I will not derive any profit from the enemies of Christ&quot; - Elizabeth of Russia

Dude, just buy like 200 VOX for $10, and wait for it to hit $1. You can be poverty stricken and still make money off some of this shit.
&gt;&gt;2294085do you think vox will really get to $10? if so can you send my $10 so i can buy vox
&gt;&gt;2294059hey man, is that oc? photoshop a dick on that pepe and you might get thrown a bone
sent
&gt;&gt;2294148if legit, thanks. I missed every moon mission because I got in a week too late :/
&gt;&gt;2294059god damnit i hate beggars, this needs to be a bannable offense.
&gt;&gt;2294085Aww man I made the mistake to buy ETH instead of BTC, and if I want to buy BTC now I have to spend atleast 50 dollarsso a donation could help me start trading19gRHTJUynB5bMmiLVv7RbZPin7P9Pq5Es
&gt;&gt;2294223It&#039;s not that bad, I mean if someone chooses to give them money off their gainz what&#039;s so wrong with begging?
Hello /biz/Musicoin will rocket hard today. Remember the last time they made an announcement with countdown? They joined Enterprise Ethereum Alliance back then, and price went from 600sats to 1400+sats.

&gt;&gt;2294101this is the dip anon
&gt;&gt;2294101You buy at the top. We need you up there to push prices higher.
&gt;&gt;2294138But I want a lambo too.
&gt;&gt;2294101They were all dipping yesterday Anon
&gt;&gt;2294160Thanks for the tip... however, I can&#039;t afford a time machine yet.
&gt;&gt;2294101Massive correction incoming, just be patient
Buy high sell low
&gt;&gt;2294113&gt;TFW crypto dips still make more than stocks
&gt;&gt;2294101not true.u can buy ARK now and thank me later.SC is also diping.
What do you think of my portfolio distributions guys?What would you improve?Do you agree with my tier lists? Welcoming any critique.Also, give me ideas for new coins to research and consider buying into.I try to rebalance this portfolio within tiers. So I might sell a Tier2 coin and buy another Tier2 coin. This ensures that when market collapses I don&#039;t end up holding absolute shitcoins and none of the good stuff. So I have to get these tier levels in check.Pardon my autism.
&gt;&gt;2293453Is it an excel file? Would you share it?
&gt;&gt;2293476No, it is Google docs.I&#039;d rather not share my personal files. You can find the template here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ATcHlJkzGiM5KXs1SdiKrW93VptpzTGJDur_E4HnKhg/template/preview?usp=drive_web#
Bump. Looks nice OP.
Why don&#039;t you just use blockfolio like the rest of us? Fucking elitists I swearYou think you are an enterprise cryptocurrency trader because you use Excel huh
No bitbean, I see you&#039;re a man of reason
I am thinking of buying more WAVES and selling DigiByte.Why?Because WAVES has actual long tail application. If we look at Ethereum, that is the biggest crypto growth potential right now. DigiByte has only hentai girls, it does not have any long tail potential, thus I classified it as Tier 4, but it recently spiked and now I have excess of Digi that I might move into safer coins.Also, one thing to note - the ones with BLUE font are tokens. Tokens I buy only with excess ETH. Why? Because they are reliant on Ethereum and move together with it. Makes most sense to keep them within the distribution of Ethereum.
&gt;&gt;2293505&gt;Why don&#039;t you just use blockfolio like the rest of us? Fucking elitists I swearBecause I don&#039;t recall my buy in points, it was mostly many years ago.Also, I don&#039;t want to keep checking this shit on my phone wherever I go.Also, Blockfolio limits coins per screen and comments, I need to have more screen space for my portfolio.Also, Blockfolio does not show coins percentage within the portfolio.
&gt;&gt;2293453Ark shitcoin?really nice portfolioi&#039;dd addCloak (probably going to surpass PIVX)Blocknet (DEX, Crosschain)
Portfolio is missing Doge, BitBean and PepeCoins.
So i just recieved an anz bank job. basically i have to do an assessment online to see if i can pass the maths questions. I failed my last one with another bank and now im trying another bank. Has anyone been through this before? - simple bank teller job
bump
&gt;&gt;2293843No, but what kind of maths questions would they ask? It is some kind of quick arithmetics? I hardly see you needing more than that to be a teller.
Yeah, last time it was simple questions, leading on to simple mathematics then after was a hard formula mathematics type eg. 45 x (?) = 12 + 46 type stuff. which i failed miserably at as i only had about 10 seconds to get it wrong or right.I&#039;m hoping i get this right but yeah obviously a teller job cant be too hard. Do you know if you can move up in these sort of roles?
&gt;&gt;2293967I have no idea about career advancement (which I would guess is somewhat limited and you would be better off going to school in the long term), but AFAIK you can really train for these exams. I remember a national IQ test show we had and one of the parts was arithmetics. The cashiers completely blew everyone out of the water solely because simple arithmetics is all they do day in day out. I&#039;m guessing the formula you had was something that would divide into integers, so the more you train that the faster you&#039;ll get at it.Personally, I would fail miserably at this test since I rarely do arithmetics and just open the Windows calculator whenever I need to do anything more than a two digit addition. Safer that way. Then again, I also don&#039;t need it for my work.
Thanks alot for your kind words, its people like you that make these forums enjoyable and more of a community atmosphere. I&#039;m hoping i get the job for now and i can study (school) in the future as well. Cheers mate - from australia
&gt;&gt;2294078Good luck with the job and don&#039;t push education too far on the backburner. Read about &quot;human capital&quot; on an occasion. Unless you are born rich or are very lucky, you are your most expensive asset.
&gt;&gt;2293843&gt;bank teller&gt;math testaddition is hard lol

How long until we see the result s of the Genesis block?Can someone give me a better idea of how it works?Much appreciated.
STRATIS STRONG
&gt;&gt;2294095what doy ou think the price will be by the end of the year?
&gt;&gt;2294136It will probably catch up to ETH, then the two of them will clash it out at the same price until either one of them has more wide-spread adoption, or they both turn out to be worthless and become $0.
To know that just look how the price of ethereum have raised in the last months,it will go up 100$ .no doubt
&gt;&gt;2294166&gt;&gt;2294162Let&#039;s hope those 3million c# developers in india use this isntead of solidity
Is ripple worth holding on to? It&#039;d the only thing I hold that hadn&#039;t gone up a little.I&#039;m not an impatient short term investor here. But if this Jewish program is destined to go down, then I&#039;d rather get out now. What you fags think?
they have a huge amount of events in June, it&#039;s bound to come up, all the best coins go up last
June 6-7 they&#039;ll be at this thing.&gt;https://moneyconf.com/

&gt;&gt;2293333Can&#039;t cripple the ripple...hold confirmed
bancor is superior, because order books, spread etc. Will be made obsolete.
I heard you like meme triangles.
I&#039;ve seen this meme arrow posted quite a few times but I don&#039;t know what it means.Is it a sign of bombing or rocketing?

Give it to me straight guys. How much more growth is possible for this? What is the most optimistic outlook?
&gt;&gt;2294088Strat is the next 1000 dollar coin.
&gt;&gt;2294088you really think strat will catch up to eth?
Real Talk: which coin will grow in value the most this year?
i think pink coin will be 15 dollars by the end of the month
ARK is a good bet , lots of room to grow
&gt;&gt;2287409XRPScreenshot this.
ETHno doubt in my mind
I don&#039;t think the US dollar is going to do very well this year if the federal reserve decide to only do one rate hike
&gt;&gt;2287448What&#039;s the big deal with ARK, there&#039;s dozens of coins that do literally the same thing as ARK.
&gt;&gt;2287439Despite the sudden grow in April, it seems to have stabilized a bit&gt;&gt;2287460Have you invested in it? It fell to half price
Ark, Strat, Bat, or Eth... If you&#039;re accounting for the ROI from the get-go, then Strat. If you&#039;re talking about the ROI from now on, I believe Ark or at. Potential for Eth as well, we&#039;ll see...
no.2287551**...ROI from now onBelieve Ark or Bat...**

&gt;&gt;2287888why woukld it be heavily shilled on biz (a mostly american user base) when americans cant buy the pre ico or ico
&gt;&gt;2287906Eth will quadruple in price by next year but it will not give you 100x - 1000x returns
&gt;&gt;2287917&gt;Was it heavily shilled on /biz/?Yes&gt;Is the userbase predominantly american?Arguably not overwhelmingly, for instance, I am british.

Look into Ethbits. It&#039;s essentially trying to be the Ether version of Bitcoin. It&#039;s brand new hasn&#039;t hit many exchanges yet, valued at 1-3 dollars. 1.3 Million Supply.

&gt;&gt;2287841Nah bro, it&#039;s totally possible for Pixar to render their next movie using thousands of 486&#039;s in fucking India on dial up.It&#039;s not like a single CPU could render faster than the amount of internet bandwidth available.
&gt;&gt;2287467What coins do what ark is aiming to do?
Sia will be a household name
&gt;&gt;2287995Why the fuck does like EVERY ICO specifically exclude the US?
Found this shitcoin with only 8k market cap.- 2 month old coin- On 3 exchanges (more coming according to dev)- Active dev- Nice logo- Nice websitehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1835672.0Tell me why it won&#039;t go to at least 100k market cap.
&gt;&gt;2292994why not just buy espers
Digibyte??? Can you please explain to me why this is growing so fast. I do not see any tech worth this raise in price.Thank you
&gt;&gt;2293727PnD
&gt;&gt;2293727Because the cult formally known as &quot;Digibros&quot; has formed an entire collective whos main goal is getting this motherfucker to $1 as soon as possible.
&gt;&gt;2293737Additionally these &quot;Digibros&quot; are known to publicly &quot;Digibro fist&quot; and will shout &quot;Digibros, assemble!&quot; before pumping the Digibytes.
&gt;&gt;2293754That is crazy guz now is 400 million .. Even for PnD coin that has to be a record right?So the coin itself has nothing to offer us??Than down it will come with a big bang (also in a record-breaking way).

Digibyte is now the leading multi-algo coin and could soon be the only multi-algo coin in the top 10. This gives it tremendous resistance against the centralization that is plaguing Bitcoin. That alone is worth a lot.Combine that with much faster block time, much larger block size limit than Bitcoin, use in the gaming community and you can see why Digibyte has gone up so much.
like my target boys?
Also Digibyte was one of the first coins to implement Segwit.
&gt;&gt;2293825Why the leading multi-algo coin? Even Myriad has that (and many other coins), how is that different?
&gt;&gt;2293905&gt;It&#039;s the resident myriad shill back yet again
&gt;&gt;2293905Compare the market cap of Myriadcoin to the market cap of Digibyte. Digibyte could soon be in the top 10. Where does Myriadcoin rank on the list?
&gt;&gt;2293816No one will play videogames anymore when crypto trading will be normies tier
&gt;&gt;2293938Why are Digibros so triggered by Myriad?
So I started 4 months ago with 2k. I feel I&#039;m too strongly into DGB. Suggestions to diversify?
Rest of the portfolio.
&gt;&gt;2292086SWT, ARK
Less DGB for more ETH, BTC and maybe some new chances is how I would configure it.
no ltc? :(
&gt;&gt;2292185That is what I was thinking, around 20 percent BTC, 50 percent ETH and 30 percent the rest.Do I make the move now, or just before the 9th?
&gt;&gt;2292204Can&#039;t say about the 9th, but can be good to just maintain the balance you want in case the bloodbath comes
&gt;&gt;2292086You could have literally faked this. Why should we believe you?
&gt;&gt;2292086Check out VTR on Bittrex
&gt;&gt;2292086&gt;xby
&gt;&gt;2292086And get some waves and vgx
&gt;here&#039;s my fake blockfolio&gt;what should i buy
&gt;&gt;2292297Yeah I sure hate those 400 percent returns.
&gt;&gt;2292311I don&#039;t understand why you would think that would be fake? That DGB would have required just a couple thousand investment not more than a few weeks ago
&gt;&gt;2292311His portofolio isn&#039;t even that impressive. I have seen anons posting portofolios of more than 500k
&gt;&gt;2292363Yep. If anyone wants to know how I did it, 50 dollars XRP in early March, sold that for 1BTC a few weeks ago and rolled it into DGB at between 100 - 300 sats.A lot of people have made a lot of money in a short period of time (power of hodling btw), and its time to switch to the next level and consolidate gains.
&gt;&gt;2292086&gt;I started 4 months ago with 2kfuck off.
Tracked over time.
&gt;&gt;2292339Then take them and stop holding this garbage
&gt;&gt;2292404&gt;Then take them and stop holding this garbageWhy is it garbage?&gt;&gt;2292389I bought 1500 dollars worth of Etherum @ 20 dollars.
factom
&gt;&gt;2292379&gt;&gt;2292380&gt;&gt;2292389Yes there&#039;s been anons who were well into 6 figures months ago, I believe these could be the same anons we are seeing in the millions now.I think a lot of the new guys also don&#039;t realize that this game has been going on for years, those who were in as late as just last year and accumulating coins like ETH would have made an absolute fortune.
&gt;&gt;2292086&gt;So I started 4 months ago with 2k. I feel I&#039;m too strongly into DGB. Suggestions to diversify?&gt;$41k return&gt;Too strongly invested&gt;wants to diversify&gt;rest of portfolio altogether doesn&#039;t even make half of DGB returns&gt;okay
&gt;&gt;2292499Exactly, I think this board is getting a absurd amount of newfags lately and many don&#039;t realize that there&#039;s people profiting from BTC since its conception.Speaking of which, I used to go to /biz/ sporadically around 2013, saw a lot of threads about BTC and anons talking about buying, mining and etc at that time I thought to myself &#039;&#039;man, this shit is expensive, I wish I knew about it earlier. It&#039;s probably too late now&#039;&#039;. I know a lot of anons say this, but damn, It&#039;s the decision of my life that I regret the most.
&gt;&gt;2292524What if the ninth fizzles out.
&gt;&gt;2292587this.But now is the time to take it back.
&gt;&gt;2292524&gt;boat loads of newfags bought in so it must have a bright future
more like larp general
what&#039;s supposed to happen on the 9th?
&gt;&gt;2292865seriously how fucken long have you dickheads been here? a week?&gt;muh triple moneyyou realize that&#039;s what&#039;s keeping all of this afloat right?
WHALE ACTIVITY SPOTTED!!!
&gt;&gt;2292587i am a newfag, as far as posting on /biz/. but I want in on cryptocurrency now, and who else would i trust for guidance? please please PLEASE FUCKING SHARE THE WISDOM....
&gt;&gt;2292587Some of us are biologically-old newfags with a lot of fiat in the bank and realizing how much we could have been making all this time with crypto. A few hundred thousand dollars is nothing if you&#039;ve been wageslaving for a $70k/yr income for over a decade.
&gt;&gt;2293029Friend, the best advice I can give you is: Do your research.Lurk on /biz/ but do not trust anons blindly, especially now that this board is filled to the brim with shills.If you have blockfolio on your cellphone, follow the newspage.Check charts and see the patterns and movements of the coins you want to invest.Read about blockchain technology.Do not buy high and sell low.Don&#039;t let your emotions take control of you, act rational.Basically, the best weapon you have to make it is knowledge, without that you will be just a pawn in the hands of shills and whales.
&gt;&gt;2293084I use your strategy to buy stocks and I made like 5% since January, but with meme magic I&#039;m up 600% from crypto in 3 weeks. Not sure what to think about it
I got in in 2013 and thought I was late, made .6 BTC then quit after I lost everything in Mintpal. Now I&#039;m back and it&#039;s tough as shit starting from zero.So yeah fuck that fagget from Mintpal Ryan what&#039;s his name, hope he enjoys getting buttfucked in prison.
&gt;&gt;2293129This is why I laugh when I see people saying that crypto is a risky market. Crypto is the most bullish market in human history, if you buy and hold any coin that isn&#039;t a complete scam you will make a lot of money. Almost every coin increased in value from may to now, as opposed to stocks, which are actually hard to trade and you have to really know what you are doing to even make 10-15% profit in a year with them. In crypto, even people who are completely illiterate in economics can make money. People who actually know the fundamentals can easily get rich.
&gt;&gt;2293084thanks friend. i have seen a few irl friends have quite a bit of unexpected success with this stuff. and i am nothing if not analytical and intuitive. at this point i am feeling secure in my ability to choose and maintain my investments wisely. i just need th3 fundamental steps for getting started (software/apps/programs to download, where to buy from, where NOT to buy from/sell to etc...) hell i don&#039;t even know what form my money needs to be in when i am ready to buy...
&gt;&gt;2293469Right, I&#039;ll give you a short list of steps that you need to take to get started:-Make a account on any exchange site with good reputation, it can be Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, LocalBitcoins, you choose. I personally prefer localbitcoins because the transactions there are fast and they don&#039;t ask your ID-After making a account, buy the amount of BTC you want-Make an account on Poloniex, Bittrex, Yobit or other of your choice to start trading altcoins-Transfer the bitcoins from your wallet on the site you are using(localbitcoins for example)to the wallet of the market site-Use your bitcoin to trade altcoinsThere you go. Also, I recommend creating a offline wallet to put your BTCs on when you want to store a large amount or want to secure your money, it&#039;s not completely safe to leave it on the wallets of these sites.
&gt;&gt;2292086&gt;&gt;2292401&gt;started 4 months ago&gt;history starts 1 month ago2/10 for getting me to reply
&gt;&gt;2293749blockfolio doesn&#039;t chart retrospectively kiddo
&gt;&gt;2293847This. I didn&#039;t start tracking or trading til early May.
&gt;&gt;2293847that&#039;s annyoing since it would be no problem if you just add the right buying dates.
&gt;&gt;2293874Yeah it&#039;s got a few little niggles but still probably the best way to keep track easily, API support would be the first thing I&#039;d like to see
So if I used BTC to buy things on Overstock, I&#039;d just pay sales tax? And then I don&#039;t have to worry about anything else?

bois im in the premine and will divvy out 400k of these shitcoins once us devs finish
There is no way to even get on for now. 17th of June is the first big date when wallets are released. Am I missing something?
&gt;&gt;2293221Nothing wrong in the short term.But POW coins are shit and they are going to be made redundant by leaps and bounds in quantum computing.
redpill me on credits pls famalam
&gt;&gt;2293275quantum computing is still decades away m8
&gt;&gt;2293275its goal int pow, it moves to masternode, check the website, 500 CRDS for a masternode
buy up when it comes out solid devs who arent bagholders, this coins going big, itll do a ubiq and you&#039;ll wish you bought up
&gt;&gt;2293042its has an elaborate shill campaign wich is nice i guess

I was thinking my money would be much better placed in crypto than in a car that&#039;s costing me money and that I don&#039;t use a lot, anyway. An extra $15k investment could make a rather large difference.What do you think, bros?
wait for a BTC dip then move it in
&gt;&gt;2294023just get a loan....
Buy 8K Ethereum, 5K Bitcoin and 2K Digibyte. You won&#039;t regret it
are most wallets compatible with windows 7 or should i download 10 to make sure?
Are you autistic?
&gt;&gt;2293951yes
so?
Is it just allergic to the 2k sat mark? It keeps dipping all the damn time.
&gt;he doesn&#039;t know what a slow dump is
&gt;&gt;2290463Shit had its run. It&#039;s all about rdd now.
&gt;he doesn&#039;t know what a resistance is
is going down
&gt;&gt;2290463&gt;&gt;2290475sorry to shill in the 10,000th DGB thread of the day, but if you want price action, there&#039;s clearly a VTR campaign going on during whale accumulation.
&gt;&gt;2290463hodl fellow digibro
&gt;&gt;2290463I sold at 2050 and bought again at 1900. It will go up again the meme triangle is getting smaller
10k by Wed. Screencap this.
&gt;&gt;2290511
&gt;&gt;2290511look at xrp&#039;s graph. now look at yours.
You&#039;re a fool to doubt how high this will rise in a few daysWent from 40 bucks to 200+ and still holding
&gt;&gt;2290511If DGB is 10k by Wed. I will quit my job
&gt;&gt;2290487Just might look into this. I don&#039;t think DGB will be doing anything again for the next couple of days, will probably keep steady or dip till wednesday, when it will start to go up again and then dump somewhere between the 8th and 9th with people looking to get out before the citibank thing.
&gt;&gt;2290531HAHAHAHAH
&gt;&gt;2290487What exchange sells VTR
&gt;&gt;2290524&gt;&gt;2290531&gt;&gt;2290543
So it&#039;s a good time to buy before it hits a dollar, then?
&gt;&gt;2290575I would say buy in now before it goes back up to 2k sat
Can we talk about how incredible this coin is for a second? People talk about strat but that 10,000% gain took them a year....Dgb has undergone a near ELEVEN THOUSAND PERCENT INCREASE.....IN FUCKING LESS THAN 3 MONTHS.It&#039;s absolutely fucking incredible, if you put in 1000$ when it was at it&#039;s low of 16 sats....you&#039;d be a fucking millionaire. It&#039;s fucking incredible.How? How does this happen? There is nothing fancy About this coin....no real gimmicks...it&#039;s a fucking minecraft coin....just how? I missed this ride sadly....are there any of you that have been in there from the start? Can you share your stories with me? i JUST WANT A PIECE OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.&gt;i&#039;m assuming it feels surreal like this OSThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpPglNkTSqU
&gt;&gt;2290511&gt;&gt;2290531wow lol
&gt;&gt;2290575&gt;It will be the most exhilarating thing you will ever experience.
&gt;&gt;2290543Better prep that resignation digibro.
&gt;&gt;2290609there is NO FUCKING WAY it hits 10k sats by then, i will fucking run around my house and screech naked if this happens.you people do realize that would be about an EIGHTY THOUSAND PERCENT INCREASE....IN THREE FUCKING MONTHS, DOES NOBODY SEE HOW HIGH IT&#039;S GOTTEN...WHAT THE FUCK&gt;&gt;2290599

&gt;&gt;2293803The beauty of crypto is who gives a shit, there&#039;s no threat of force to stop you.
&gt;&gt;2293477KARMA coin is a very good candidate.
Have fun in jail kiddos
&gt;&gt;2294008what law are they breaking?
is any of this stuff you can display on bittrex (CCI, momentum index....) useful for trading? never see it mention heresomeone with finance knowledge aware me plz
no not really
MACD is very helpful
&gt;&gt;2292941TA only informs you when is the right moment to jump in/out when you want to do it anyways (based on fundamentals)trading only using TA will make you lose everything as it alone has no real valueask yourself why academic professors aren&#039;t trading millionaires, when their mathematical skills are far far better than any of those bullshit indicators
&gt;&gt;2292980This. Ignore TA. You&#039;d be literally better off just picking the coins with the most memeable mascots.
&gt;&gt;2292951how so? is it due to how volatile the market is?
&gt;&gt;2292999Normal stock market theories don&#039;t really apply on something as new as cryptos.
&gt;&gt;2292980knowing when to jump in/out won&#039;t hurt thoughany quick guide what to look at here?
&gt;&gt;2292999it&#039;s really only good for short term margin trading.
&gt;&gt;2293015and it&#039;s only good till longer trend bends over, there is nothing worse than to make 10 good 0.5% trades and then market reverses making you lose 25% or making you a hodlerevery short-term trader eventually loses more than he gained
&gt;&gt;2292941because it doesnt help.&gt;drawing le meme lines and trying to predict the futureare u really that retarded?i follow this since like 4 weeks.all these fancy crypto gurus on twatter and elsewhere, drawing le meme lines, actually didn&#039;t predict shit and are wrong 50% of the time.same as myself. im wrong 50% of the time too.and all i do is buying stuff thats shilled here and gut feeling.
&gt;&gt;2293012to be honest, if you are not good in math then don&#039;t bothermagic indicators are only transformations to price that you can see with your bare eyes anywayswhat is more, they are volatile to some math problems and can be misleading many times if you don&#039;t really understand the formula behind themjust looking at price, relying on supports and resistances + fundamentals will take you 10 times farther than any (if RFI &lt; 30 -&gt; buy), trust me
&gt;&gt;2293093what&#039;s RFI?

how did we sleep ladsthe future is looking bright
&gt;&gt;2293104&gt;already up 40%wew lads gonna visit the lambo dealer later this week at this rate
HODL guys, I think that we are gonna see some mad gains this week :)
So in just a few hours ZEN will be tradable on Bittrex! Do you think we will see over $200 a coin like with Zcash?Trading should commence around 9:30 am to 12pm Eastern standard time!
Small correction it&#039;s 12:30 PM Eastern
My best guess would be a range between $10-15 for a while.I think the main dev was spreading some bullshit on Twitter the past few days, that could affect it a bit.
Stock up MUSIC it&#039;s getting another chance to make it to the moon!

I withdrawed some BTC from Bittrex and transfered them to the Bleutrade.Bittrex withdraw status is &quot;completed&quot; 10 minutes now but not even &quot;pending&quot; on Bleutrade.Should I be worried?
maybe a little
....you do know that Bleutrade&#039;s BTC deposit address was under maintenance due to a DDOS attack..right OP?
&gt;&gt;2293440Bleutrade always takes foreverWatch that Fujicoin tho
&gt;&gt;2293459&gt;&gt;2293452geez i shit my pantsbut i can already see it pending on bleutraderelief
I&#039;ll just ask here instead of making a new thread.&gt;sign up for bittrex.&gt;no email to verify account.&gt;open request.&gt;get told you need a verified email adress to open requests.The fuck do I do?
Isn&#039;t it always a bit risky to transfer directly from one exchange to another? I would always do it through a wallet on your own computer.
&gt;&gt;2293606thanks for advice. i will do it this way from now on
&gt;&gt;2293606why is it riskier?
&gt;&gt;2293683it&#039;s not.
Check the bleutrade wallet address you sent to in blockchain explorer. If it is there, you are safe. Then bleu just needs to sync
&gt;&gt;2293696This.
&gt;&gt;2293589Make an email you retard
&gt;&gt;2293606&gt;just take double the fees lmao
&gt;&gt;2293606i dont think so double transferring just burns money
WHO HERE IS ALREADY IN PROFIT?WHO HERE IS HOLDING FOR THE MOON?Jelly no coiners and shit coiners unwelcome.We don&#039;t want your shittybytes or ledditcoin.

&gt;&gt;2290165wow, thats actually a nice wallet gif. alright i&#039;ll lurk a bit longer OP
&gt;glorified scam with torrentno thank youcurrent p2p is fine
&gt;&gt;2290180yeah who wants a client where seeded data is encrypted and decentralized across a blockchain instead of sitting on a server somewhere..
&gt;&gt;2290180&gt;Calls scam with no proof.Probably a bitter no coiner.
BITCOIN IS SO SLOW REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI&#039;m going to miss the launch.
What about that sell wall lmfao
&gt;&gt;2290281i really think its a fake wall to be honest
&gt;&gt;2290281Have you seen the price on sell walls that have been decimated lately? Think about RDD man, Verge, fucking mooncoin even, just chasing pumps. This has legit tech and the dev just started posting again. looks like a great entry point imo.
I&#039;m not even kidding here boys.Getting in large when my btc confirms.
&gt;&gt;2290349this is powerful
&gt;&gt;2290349holy shit...hahaha, fuck yes

&gt;when you think youre valiantly overcoming the big bad sell wall&gt;when youre actually eating premined dungbags courtesy of the dev and his giggling matesask me how i know
See ya all at saturn
AAAAAHHHHIT TOOK TOO LONG I JUST BARELY MISSED IT I&#039;M TOO LATE NOW I&#039;M TOO LATE
aw man this is about to get fun
&gt;&gt;2290998Cappedyou&#039;re fucked faggot, sorry you didn&#039;t listen
I put 1.5btc into breaking down that wall. You&#039;re welcome.
&gt;&gt;2291021Ily
&gt;&gt;2291015Well, I&#039;m in.Hope I don&#039;t regret this.
&gt;&gt;2291015Dude its gonna be 100k at this rate. GET IN.
I FUCKING TOLD YOU ALLthis could do 200% tonight.
&gt;&gt;2291085then why is it suddenly dropping. fuck
&gt;&gt;2291093Literally one person sold around 1000 coins. It doesn&#039;t just move straight up forever man, my god
&gt;&gt;2291059Well fuck my ass it&#039;s down alreadyAfter I spent like 5 minutes placing and pulling buy orders, chasing it all the way up to 11106 too...Should have just left my original buy order at 10000or not bought at all, knew it was too good to be true buying after the 8k range
hodl
&gt;was waiting for someone to dump below the 8600 sell wall for 30 mins&gt;no one did, say fuck it, buy big into the wall&gt;go piss&gt;come back at 10kfeels mad gucci, vapes and fidget spinners all around ya&#039;ll, see you kids at toyota prius money in a few weeks
Any graphic designers in here wanna shoop some VTR into pictures for a meme campaign similar to digibytes? That will drive us to 100k.
&gt;&gt;2291059&gt;Buying the top
&gt;&gt;2290044offical thread theme songhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM
&gt;&gt;2291093&gt;&gt;2291101Weakhands are dropping with their measly 10% gains, no cause for concern we&#039;re riding this rocket to real profit
&gt;the ledger is all sell orders&gt;still holding
&gt;&gt;2291148MY HANDS ARE MOTHERFUCKING DIAMONDS
&gt;&gt;2291122I know, I know. I really shouldn&#039;t have but I was already about to buy it so... fuck I made a big mistake never buy at the ATHFuck if only I was like 2 minutes earlier and got in at 8.5k&gt;&gt;2291148I REALLY fucking hope you&#039;re right because this doesn&#039;t look good.
&gt;&gt;2291186You played yourself buddy there&#039;s no volume
&gt;&gt;2291195VTR had its largest volume spike in history a few days ago. These pumps always start with no volume
&gt;&gt;2291204It&#039;s fine to buy in with no volume when it&#039;s low, but not when it&#039;s at ATH
&gt;&gt;2291204how high do we realistically see it going in the next few days/weeks?
&gt;&gt;2291218Depends on the dev. I expect it going 2x off speculation alone.
&gt;&gt;2291218It&#039;s going 5x in the next 2 months.
&gt;&gt;229121850-100k seems good, it has low coin supply
gambled my way to 2 BTC back in 2014, now i can really play aroundhttps://www.999dice.com/?10716399
i&#039;m going to have to stay up all night looking at this
Glad to see this finally taking off. I got in early and was hoping it would get attention soon. TO THE MOON!
HULK HANDS
Stupid cucks selling.Guys this coin has 10 million capis rank 199, has only 2 million market capLiteral bittorrent on blockchain?THis is easy going to moon to 1 dollar. And thats still only a 10 million market capI firmly believe this will be 5 dollars or more this week
the spread on this shit is retarded. have you guys been watching the order book?feels like a certain someone is inflating the price
&gt;&gt;2291195You&#039;re right, the volume is small as fuck.I&#039;m finally up, but man this volume better pick up...
&gt;&gt;2291254Not too bad considering how quickly it&#039;s growing.
&gt;&gt;2291265It has gone up by 5btc in the past 15 minutes
my ETH is taking fucking forever to transfer into bittrex. should i wait for next dip? 10.4k sat?
&gt;&gt;2291300i got in at 10.7 because i couldn&#039;t fucking match the speed then it immediately fell to 10.ah well. i&#039;m strapped in. lets go.
&gt;&gt;2291313It&#039;s already got buy support above 12000 sats
&gt;&gt;2291300Id get in ASAP. Ive been burned too many times by coins that just keep rising.
&gt;&gt;2291321i&#039;ve already in the last fucking 15 minutes made back the money i lost on dgb from making a retarded mistake earlier.i love you guys.
fuck should I sell or buy more and holdI only bought 200 at 9922 sats
&gt;&gt;2291339buy more and hold
Doubled our money in one night.Suck it faggots.
just bought into this fucking insane wall because i&#039;m not a nocoin newfag and want to ride the coaster...bracing for this to be an obvious pump n dump though.
What happens when that 7 btc wall at 20000 is broken? Do holders dictate the new price?
BUY THE DIP!BUY THE DIP!BUY THE DIP!BUY THE DIP!
Still a bit pissed I was so close to getting in at 8500 before that 10k sell wall broke but this is okay too I guess.
I&#039;m buying the fucking dip
tHANK GOD I GOT IN BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
BUY THE DIP OR FOMO AND BUY AGAIN AT 20K ATH.THIS SHIT IS GOING TO CHANGING THE INTERNET.
&gt;&gt;2290044lol i bought some of that wallquickest turnaround of profit after purchase everi was the last one through the fucking shuttle hatch god damn
is this a PnD though. fucking got burned on the last one i did. i don&#039;t mind having steel hands if it&#039;s a legit fuckin coin
why didnt i go all in on that wall
&gt;&gt;2291487good question my friend
&gt;&gt;2291486The coin looks solid. Rewards people who upload content with VTR. Ensures best content is uploaded.
&gt;&gt;2291502yeah i studied it a bit earlier when someone posted a thread about it. i&#039;m a huge fucking torrenter and also a software dev, so this project makes a lot of sense to me.obviously an amateur trader though, so i&#039;ve been picking it up over the last few weeks. i&#039;m a expat from /pol/ ;)
going all in at 14500 and going to bed. don&#039;t let me down you fucks.
I put all my money into ARK. Should I cash out some and put it into VTR?
&gt;&gt;2291525This shit is going nuts, there are worse ideas
&gt;&gt;2291525to be very honest, it&#039;s high risk right now. thin walls on both sides. should&#039;ve bought in earlier
isn&#039;t this a not-so-good sign?
I gotta admit the low ass volume on this is very concerning.Is like only people on /biz/ aware of this coin or something?If someone sold 10BTC this will dump down to like 1000 sat. This can&#039;t be safe.
&gt;&gt;2291543Usually, but the sell orders for this coin are so thin that a few BTC down the line makes it look bad
&gt;&gt;2291531&gt;&gt;2291540ill wait. i have $400 into ARK, which seems promising rn. dont have any more btc to put in, until coinbase gets it to me wednesday
&gt;&gt;2291543Price is moving so fast that buying orders aren&#039;t accumulating.
&gt;&gt;2291560that was my thought, thanks.
&gt;&gt;2291574Actually just no one wants to buy it
no one help this 0.6bitcoin asshat make money
&gt;&gt;2291554When normies see something rise they have an urge to buy in. We&#039;ve done our part.Also when did you guys buy in? 8430 sats here
Hold, it will keep going up during the next days
&gt;&gt;229158510k sat. still an almost 50% gain over few minutes
&gt;&gt;2291593Nobody wants to sell. This is a great sign. buy the small fucking dips
&gt;&gt;2291593It will go down tomorrow relax, this does seem like a long term hold. Discourages people uploading fake content.
&gt;&gt;2291585i backed out for 40 mins for profit margins in other coin and missed out on 8400 settled for so settled 10k
BUT WHEM WE ARE PLANING TO DUMP THIS BITCH?!
FUCK
BUY THE FUCKING DIPthis shit is clearly being manipulated
&gt;&gt;2291585I got in at around 11k.&gt;&gt;2291593Definitely going to correct soonor now?
wew that went down fast. this is what happens when the buy wall is so thin
Wew, that dump.
&gt;&gt;2291622&gt;&gt;2291618It&#039;s bouncing back instantly. Buy the dip or cry forever
look like it&#039;s pumping for round fucking 2.
SHE&#039;S GOING BACK UP BOYS HOPE YOU BOUGHT AT 8000 SATS LIKE I JUST DID LMFAO
BUY THE DIIIIIIIIIIP!
&gt;&gt;2291618Yeah but the ask prices are still as high as they were before.&gt;&gt;2291636Wow, you got lucky.
&gt;just put all my available maincoin on BAT&gt;don&#039;t want to get raped on fees by reversing and going to VTR&gt;have to wait a few days before my next batch of fiat is approved by Coinbaseoh well
Well that was a speedy recovery. I tried to buy in at 9000 sats but it moved too fast.
&gt;&gt;2291631i already made my fair share. i don&#039;t want to test my luck on this game of musical chairs again.
&gt;&gt;2291660&gt;Not staring in 2013 with faucets and literally riding on free money today
DED COINYou faggots are getting played.
should I sleep on this coin or will I wake up to a huge loss
&gt;&gt;2291664No shit anon, did you even look at the market history. All of the 9k sats orders were executed in the same fucking second. Shit is being manipulated hard just abandon this crap.
&gt;&gt;2291701wondering the same. have a sell order set to 17000 SAT but wondering if its gonna get eaten
&gt;&gt;2291701Too early for a loss. This is a good coin. 10x gains.
&gt;&gt;2291701If you didn&#039;t buy an hour and 40 minutes ago before the initial launch you are better staying out of this shit trust me.&gt;inb4 screencapped this
&gt;&gt;2291701&gt;&gt;2291713i really would not sleep on a coin like this. you&#039;ve just seen how easily it can dip. you need to keep a close eye on it or just sell it now and have peace of mind.
&gt;&gt;2291701hold it mid term
Was this 100% increase in like 2 hours? HOW DO I FIND THESE THINGS OUT EARLIER! EVERY COIN IS SPAMMED ON HERE! WHERE IS THE REAL ONES&gt;!&gt;!
&gt;&gt;2291737Check when the thread opened, you had exactly 5 minutes to get on this P&amp;D train otherwise you are fucked like 99% of normies that are buying now.
&gt;&gt;2291684&gt;ID: 8+8+4Literally easy as arithmetic. I will take your advice to heart, fair anon.
Ya I know. How do you know somthing will take off. First time here. Also, is bittrex good for trading? I was using polo last few days, but they dont have all these shitcoins people are pumping.
&gt;&gt;2291747&gt;&gt;2291737Ok I&#039;m overexaggerating, maybe an hour.
Well fuck all the giant dips and spikes, this is playing with fire it seems.Think I&#039;m going to take out some profits and my initial, and then try to buy the 10k dips and sell these 12-13k highs.
&gt;&gt;2291757Bittrex is good if you are trading with a solid sum of coins, because the fees will rape you if you are just starting out. And you have to be careful with Bittrex to not get pulled into these p&amp;d&#039;s when they have already pumped hard.
&gt;&gt;2291780Hm, I see. If im starting with 1k, that should be fine right? DESU, im going to look for these coins early, try to get in, and get a set amount back. Greed has fucked me before and I learned. Alot of people here made 200% and will still get burned for not getting out now
is this shit pumping again because it&#039;s lookin like it&#039;s giving up for the night.
&gt;&gt;2291780Also, how long does deposit take? I sent over LTC to try to make it faster. Any experience with that? Im using Bittrex
whats going on
&gt;&gt;2291798Be 100% sure that you are actually getting on early, and don&#039;t get too greedy with the profits. Set sell orders on like 30-50% profit, it&#039;s still great money and you are not risking panicking when shit starts to drop hard.
&gt;&gt;2291804&gt;&gt;2291813It&#039;s accumulating and finding support. This is a great sign that the suppor is this high. Look at the order book, too
&gt;&gt;2291812I also used LTC, apparently it&#039;s quick. I heard that DOGE might be faster but this might be shilling, I don&#039;t know.
&gt;&gt;2291830Yup. Already went through. Took maybe 10 mins total.
&gt;&gt;22918201 BTC of buy support down to 9500. Yeaaah ok
HEY GUYS! NEW HERE! Whats a reliable way to know which coins to jump into?
&gt;&gt;2291813/biz/ got scammed if they weren&#039;t in at 8500 sats
&gt;&gt;2291854Just follow the memes.
&gt;&gt;2291543Not really cause there are only 10 million coins available. This can go wild within no time and not stopping.
Fuck, maybe I should have sold when it was 14k...If you&#039;re one of the people that got in below 10k then this doesn&#039;t really affect you... But it looks like whoever was manipulating it stopped or sold and left, and the pump is over.&gt;&gt;2291877yep
&gt;&gt;2291877i got in at 10.7 and got out at 12.1 on the second pump by the skin of my nuts as it started to drop.didn&#039;t make much but didn&#039;t come out behind.
&gt;&gt;2291912How much did you make in USD total? Curious how much a trade like that is worth. As long as you make some, the .25% fees on bitterex dont really matter, right?
&gt;&gt;2291912Hope you have fun picking out your new Honda.
get dumped on shitcoin fags, im keeping my money in BAT
&gt;&gt;2291820what are you using to view orderbooks?
&gt;&gt;2291947It&#039;s bittrex but they are changing so fast
It&#039;s on the way back up. I hope you guys held or bought in.
&gt;&gt;2291886What an idiot. You still don&#039;t know shit about markets. This thing will go to $2 per coin at least considering the accumulation the past weeks. and you&#039;re crying about 2 cents? Please
here we go boys
Y&#039;all niggas best be buyin the dip.
&gt;&gt;2291947bittrex has a separate order book tab. you&#039;ll see it right next to the timeline tab.&gt;&gt;2291886low volume means it&#039;s very easy for the price to skyrocket, but if the price drops, you have almost no buy support. that&#039;s why you have to be cautious with these kinds of coins that come out of nowhere and promise mad gainz.
it is moving so damn fast 12.4k now
Why is this market being manipulated so hard lmao
&gt;&gt;2292021and dumped, again, and backup again&gt;mfw
&gt;&gt;2292026Whales don&#039;t get to be whales by having the attention span of a neet.
Pulled out m8s, made a few hundred bux but not worth the risk of niggers dumping
And everyone&#039;s gone from the thread...
HODL
Who ever is still holding has some steel balls. Get your profit and get out. Most will get burned bad
&gt;&gt;2292085You&#039;ve been jittery all night, you do know this is a long hold right?
&gt;We will reward 1% of premine to anyone or team of developer that could develop a working concept of &#039;BitTorrent on Blockchain&#039;One of the rule is that the solution must be achievable with decentralised/distributed concept, contribute it to our project.and only if they can deliver it before us.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=889481.0It&#039;s nothing guys
&gt;&gt;2292111Yeah yeah, they&#039;re always long term (bag)holdsIt&#039;s my fault, I messed up not selling when I should have.
&gt;&gt;2292206this, ehshould sell it when i posted this&gt;&gt;2291608this is exactly when it crashed all the way down
This is easily the next DGB HOLY SHIT
&gt;&gt;2292251Yep. At the rate it&#039;s going even the people who bought before the sell wall will be losing money, if they were dumb enough to hold.I guess it&#039;s not enough to get into a pump early and quickly, you also have to get out early and quickly too.
&gt;&gt;2292026because it has low volume
FUCK YOU BIZ, WHY IM EVEN HERE
cant say Ive made money (I have) but this one is going to moon land real quick. I paid rent and dads medical bills after today. THANK YOU BIZ
These smaller coins usually shoot up once burgerland wakes up, while established ones do well when asia is awake.
I&#039;m gonna to laugh at people who sold at a loss kek&gt;back to 12k sat
Im just glad I got on a low volume coin before they blow up completely like this one.
&gt;&gt;2292455I really hope you&#039;re right.
can a single one of you explain the purpose of this torrent+blockchain thing?
how many of you got JUST&#039;d?
&gt;&gt;2292468yea its such a small volume if you are scared just put a sell order for a 1% profit and let it rest in a few h it will sell no problem
&gt;&gt;2292588makes it anonymous
&gt;&gt;2290070Sorry, this board only cares about lambos, fuck off please.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAANOTHER SCAM PUMP AND DUMP TO ADD TO THE LIST
LADS WERE DOING ITweve gone from a sell wall to a buy wall.WE MARSS
&gt;&gt;2293191yea im waiting for at least 20% gains for today
&gt;&gt;2290044&gt;mention it once in SIA thread&gt;suddenly VTR thread for the first time ever on /biz/Wow... I just want to say that VTR is one huge gamble guys... if dev delivers... we are talking about 50-100$ per VTR, however so far he has not shown anything special so far. He has made only empty promises.t. holding since beginning of 2017
Okay brozChances of this hitting 17k today?Or should I take profits while I have the chance?
&gt;&gt;229367117k is too much 15 is probably a cap for today
&gt;&gt;2292716makes what anonymous? the torrents?pretty much all torrent clients now have the ability to use proxies.adding blockchain leaves an immortal paper trail, it&#039;s literally the opposite.
Bought in at 14K earlier like a retard not sure if I should cash out when I break even or be greedy and try make a profit.
&gt;&gt;2293918if you dont mind holding go for it but if you are dooing quick trades i dont think so, i got out at 19% profit at around 12k
Who here /trading4fun/?I just put a few hundred euros on bittrex today and I&#039;m just having fun moving the money from one coin to another. who cares if a lose?

&gt;&gt;2292419It&#039;ll be a race to the bottom in the upcoming weeks. Mark my words.
Yeah right, right before brass is released. What&#039;s the point of posting here, biz will be quick to jump on shitcoins but as if anyone here is holding enough to effect the price in any significant way.

do you think there will be another dip on btc/usd?I want to get into bitcoin but price seems so high and I&#039;ve been waiting for it to dip for the last week or so... is it ever goin to happen or should I just buy now?When do you think should someone who wants to get in now buy?
&gt;&gt;2293823Don&#039;t buy in, you&#039;ll be too much of a pussy to hold if it only slightly dips below your entry point
&gt;&gt;2293823BTC will be $100,000 in 10 years
&gt;&gt;2293823Don&#039;t worry about Bitcoin price. Buy in at any price, and use the crypto exchanges to leverage to higher bitcoins.Bitcoin is for long hodl anyway. If it crashes now, who cares. Let&#039;s check again next year.
&gt;&gt;2293839let&#039;s asume for the sake of my question that I wouldn&#039;t be
&gt;&gt;2293858that was kinda my line of thought too... I mean it&#039;d just be like 500 bucks but i&#039;d still feel like a scrub if it&#039;d dip right after me buying...
&gt;&gt;2293840no 1000000 in 2020
remember me? I was the guy who told you all at least 10 times to buy xvg.xem about to take off like a fucking rocket. hop the fuck on lads.
&gt;&gt;2292245What rocket? It&#039;s already priced fairly high. Even if it goes x10 that ain&#039;t a rocket.
&gt;&gt;2292245&gt;not buying dopecoingold
&gt;&gt;2292245already made 20% of it today when it jumped, gona let if fall down to 8k and buy gain with a +20% order ready to sell, easiest money of my life
Agreed, this one is due to multiply for a while now. Decent coin and not just a pump, hodl
&gt;&gt;2292424It will not fall, this is the beggining of second top
&gt;&gt;2292487&gt;[I also believe so, glad I got it in the dip
&gt;long period of inactivity (accumulation)&gt;massive volume spikefuck this is actually it

&gt;&gt;2292720&gt;&gt;2292735I hope you guys are right. Too long have I lurked and been wary of advice from biz but you guys seem to be pretty spot on with some of this shit.0.265 btc in at 9070. Fingers crossed anon don&#039;t fuck me desu
Sold this meme coin for xvg already made more from xvg than xem
&gt;&gt;2292762You can easily tell if coin is just shilled or real gain is incoming. Look at the volume, slowly increasing, not over-hyped on /biz/ yet.
&gt;&gt;2292245&gt;tfw no money left to investfuck
&gt;&gt;2292762Just don&#039;t get greedy with it, sell once you made 50%. And don&#039;t sell if it should dip a bit.This is a stable coin with proper development and good ideas; no shitcoin shillinh here.
Is it still worth holding xvg?
&gt;&gt;2293241only if you like free moneybuy the dip now, last chance
&gt;Buying coin made for drug dealers/criminalsWhat a filthy shit you are anon. I&#039;m glad that you won&#039;t make any profit because normal companies are not going to use this junkcoin
Fortunately BTC has never been used to purchase drugs
&gt;&gt;2293746come to think of it Cash has never been used by criminals either. i&#039;m going all in on Cash
&gt;&gt;2293681Don&#039;t be angry. It will crash soon desu.
&gt;&gt;2293681hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahlook at mr. morals over here looking to make money trading ANYTHING in a bubble
&gt;&gt;2293764why it&#039;s going to crash? Is there something we need to know?
&gt;&gt;2293786That he i salty he didn&#039;t get in earlier
You gonna kys when alphabay accepts verge.
&gt;&gt;2293681OFFLINE WALLET.I love this coin
website looks fcking great
Isn&#039;t this the coin Crypt0 mentioned back around March?Seeing that It was pumped today, is there something coming out for it or what?
&gt;&gt;2293783june 15th they are releasing a platform called Boardwalk, where people can apparently trade services for tokens.
&gt;&gt;2293801Nice. Just checked it out. Looks promising albeit rather cumbersome.But the decentralization factor and low transaction fee which blockchain inherently works make this project worth investing.
There&#039;s still time before we&#039;re going to Jupiter, /biz/
&gt;&gt;2293869This coin is going places.Steady price increase, it&#039;s setting itself up to go to fucking orbit.
Hi Anons, You are probably enjoing the day drinking a Martini while driving your Lambo to your boat... Guess what, you can pick up XDN for cheap now...check the roadmap here:http://icco.digitalnote.org/roadmap.html
&gt;&gt;2293739Already had a little bit, just bought a shitload on this high dip
&gt;&gt;2293810wise move! after again beating 300 sats it will go to 500+ easily.
FUAAARKK I wish i had more money to put in, looking very bullish
&gt;&gt;2293832bought a cheeky 1k
I love fat women - they smell like burgers and regret. They break their backs for you and will fight to the death for the last piece of chicken. When you eat a fat chick out you get a 3 course meal, extra gravy - mexican fat chicks, extra salsa picante. When you fuck a skinny chick you get a pump and dump then game over, when a fat chick fucks you, she pumps and dumps, brings her whale friends to help and pumps and dumps over and over again. Fat chicks bring prosperity, rub her belly like shes a chinese buddah and you get to make a wish. They&#039;re thirsty for attention so tweet at @bittrexexchange and tell her, dinner is ready. MOONCOIN
1-2 Days and the Batocalypse will happen buy now or never forgive yourself dont say i didnt warn you for the profits you will make

bump for 14k
&gt;&gt;2281741&gt;i&#039;m not a well connected whale who bought a massive position @ ico and sold for that guaranteed 7x return further securing my place in the land of the lambo
im out.
Hardly no one w as able to get in on the ico, it sold out in like 10 seconds
If you&#039;re not in now then you hate money and you will KYS this time next year
&gt;&gt;2281741Consisee this an ico for the non whales who bought in.Its atb35 cents right now. No reason it shouldnt be 1 plus dollars
&gt;&gt;2281816You&#039;re going to miss out the massive gains.
&gt;&gt;2281822ive more than doubled my money, can&#039;t complain. expecting a correction soon and will jump back in.
see why i mean?
Get in on the dip
What is BAT&#039;s mining setup? Any way to mine now?
&gt;&gt;2281928will be doing
&gt;&gt;2281941~1200
Thx! This is why I like biz, heads up on these lambo coins
&gt;&gt;2281960i had that as my buy in, but it looks as though it might go to 10000. i think some whales are intentionally killing the price to buy back. might me wrong tho
rip
&gt;&gt;2281978yes i can see, lots to soak up for 4000 sat, been here before just make sure you get teh bottom
wewI got out at 135~
OH fuck I got shilled. Feels bad man
&gt;mfwwell that was a nice dip.Last chance on board cucks
&gt;&gt;2282039Hold on to it. It&#039;s going to be added to polo
yes&gt;&gt;2281939yes you mine by running the brave browser kek
&gt;&gt;2282009think we hit the bottom
&gt;&gt;2282040this is not the last chance. this will rise and then crash hard when whales get rid of their collections. then there will be slow rise through the year. so sell in the next rise
BLOCKCHAIN CONFIRMS AREN&#039;T ACTING FAST ENOUGH I WANNA BUY THE DIP REEEEEEEEE
Get back inI was going to sell at .27 cents but the whales are just manipulating the market.If you bought last night HOLD!This coin has only been live for 6 hrs, way more gains to be had.
&gt;&gt;2282044Time to cast my hands in steel
&gt;&gt;2282040bottom lasted like 30sec, waiting for next1
Why don&#039;t the whales let this grow for awhile before they sell.
anyone considered setting up a raspberry pi that is constantly watching ads on the BAT browser?could be profitable especially with future gain%btw. thats a huge red candle :D
&gt;&gt;2282070they likely sell a few inbetween and as soon as they broke even they will let it go high
&gt;&gt;2282070just wait a little while itll dip again. itll do another 11000
&gt;&gt;2282070Cos they already doubled their money
&gt;&gt;2282090x6 actually but as a whale myself, I am planning to wait it out till it gets added to polo
&gt;&gt;2282070It&#039;s just some weak hands that sell. Nothing to worry. I don&#039;t sell before we hit at least 20k.
&gt;&gt;2282081surely they aren&#039;t stupid enough to let this happen
&gt;&gt;2281741IRON HANDS M&#039;LORD
i reckon it&#039;ll hit atleast 14k again today.
Don&#039;t miss out.
&gt;&gt;2282158itll hit 11000 again just wait it out
&gt;&gt;2282205Ico price was $.035 current price is $.31https://icostats.com/Idk friend, I have decided to cut my losses and wait for the dip
&gt;&gt;2282158RRRRRRWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Mithril hands get lambos
&gt;&gt;2282280dip&#039;s been an gone. on to new heights.
&gt;&gt;2282280&gt;.035&gt;now 10x the price overnightYeah I think I&#039;ll buy in some other time, boys.
&gt;&gt;2282311This is the time to buy you idiot.Any whale with half a brain cell will see the momentum this coin has and expect x20. Just look at the trade volume doubling in hours.
&gt;&gt;2282339i have legit guessed every rise and fall of this so far.will have a second, smaller dip after it hits 14 again, then on to the moon. (depending on sell whales)
&gt;&gt;2282380Whales set the initial price high to rope in suckers. Once people realize they gettin played the price will drop
&gt;&gt;228239314900 ask wall incoming trust me.
&gt;&gt;2282393won&#039;t happen today though.
&gt;could&#039;ve bought in at 8k in the morning yet finally only decided now at 13k.Well I made a small loss due to being a scaredy cat, I think this will explode in a few months.
honestly things are getting out of control, it will explode in a few hours/days
&gt;&gt;2282415itll dip again, porbly 12000 now than 11000 than i last said
You can&#039;t loose with this coin.Look at the other coin with no team/no idea - they are mooning.You don&#039;t even need to shill this coin, it&#039;s pure gold!
&gt;&gt;2281741considering putting down .3eth at around 12k satoshi mark, what are rational expectations for gains??
&gt;&gt;2282465That&#039;s fine, but I made a few misses before when waiting for dips. Remember there is not just one whale group, you never know when a pump is due for what.
50 btc to 14kExpecting a correction? I am already +80%, maybe sell half and buy back more cheaper?What you guys think?
&gt;&gt;228249130% by end of day, it going to be bouncing between 15000 and 11000-12000
&gt;&gt;2282500do it.its what ive done
&gt;&gt;2282505what gives you hope for BAT? it&#039;s pretty sparse in the meme department and I&#039;m eyeballing bitbeans with my extra gains investments.
&gt;&gt;2282158bought just before the dipkill me
Missed out on strat, missed out on eth, missed out on Xvg, missed out on eth. Didn&#039;t miss out on bat though. Thank you lord
&gt;&gt;2281741Clever LARP
&gt;&gt;2282523because this has utility and developed by people going back as far as netscape days, memes are unneccessary... comparing to bitbeans.... lets just say one of the leading founders of javascript is quite overpar to some devs in new hampshire who wont reveal themselves and work on their &quot;bean&quot; &quot;part-time&quot;
Whales set up 2 walls one to drive the price down and one to pick up the panic sells. Watched it last night with sia.
&gt;&gt;2282575oh shit wrong thread lel
So does anyone think BAT is a good long-term coin, or is it only going to be good for a month or two? I think it might be good long-term especially if advertisers get on board and the dev team remain active on it.I dunno if it will hit $10 a coin but I think it has potential.
&gt;&gt;2282580fair enough, but don&#039;t be too hard on bean holders, I could have doubled by money the past few days if I bought in at 50 sats. It seems like a pretty reliable swing trade if you keep beans on the mind. You sold me on BAT though, I&#039;ve put in an order at 120250 sats for when it dips.
&gt;&gt;2282626it is definitely a 1 dollar coin
&gt;&gt;2282626Just wait till it hits poloniex
Fill it in if you want moonhttps://m.poloniex.com/coinRequest
&gt;&gt;2282505As i said 1200 incoming
choo choo!
stupid gay coin and stupid gay biz
&gt;&gt;2282823stay mad pajeet, we still havn&#039;t had most of america and asia open up to it.
I&#039;m debating picking up some of this coin. Seems like now would kind of be the right time (?) but I don&#039;t want to sell any of my RDD for it as RDD has been pulling me out of the 1btc deep hole I&#039;ve been in.
&gt;it was 7k sat last night&gt;the shills were saying it would increase&gt; I didn&#039;t listen
&gt;&gt;2282879&gt;he fell for the kike saying it would tank&gt;he probably still believes the same kike in this thread saying it will tankStupid goy. He&#039;s just trying to make people sell so he can drive the price down and buy.
&gt;&gt;2282879tfw bought it at 7k
&gt;&gt;22829726.8k rite here bb ;)
Literally pajeetcoin
&gt;&gt;2283146&gt;&gt;2282823&gt;&gt;2282058:^)
&gt;&gt;2283222BAT is, yes.
&gt;&gt;2281741It&#039;s got some extreme horizontal price movement right now. What&#039;s gonna happen /biz/?To the /moon/ or to the /core/?
uuuuuuuh........guys?
&gt;&gt;2283291Bought at the core so it&#039;s easy riding for me lol I see this slowly stabilizing on a lower end before mooning again in a month.
&gt;&gt;2283520It&#039;s bots bro. The wall will move back if everything in front of it gets bought.
&gt;&gt;2283520once the whales have distributed the coins this will look more even. People just buy BAT up, because they know it is oging to be huge
waiting for my deposit to come
&gt;&gt;2283545&gt;&gt;2283568UUUHHHH.... GUYS ?????
&gt;&gt;2283520Looked very similar to that last night before it took off. Had about 2 mini walls and one huge wall
&gt;&gt;2283592sell now
DROPPING TERRIBLY FAST... SELL SELL MY GOD
NOTHIS WASNT SUPPOSED TO HAPPENNON O
&gt;&gt;2283610&gt;buying thislmao
Don&#039;t listen to the faggots saying this will tank.Already doubled my money from last night. Feeling gooood.

&gt;&gt;2283675not buying your bags
&gt;&gt;2283675myself again, your also being played and other id&#039;s before by&gt;&gt;2283592. The token is muhc bigger thn this.
&gt;&gt;2283683my bags started at 6k. its an oppurtunity for the next 1-4 weeks. Your hands now, not mine.
&gt;&gt;2283715you realize it&#039;s going to get dumped once it touches polo, right
in an hourWE SHALL KNOW THE FATE OF THIS COIN
just bought 521. Lets see where this ride goes.
&gt;&gt;2283752Shit is gonna spike at the triangle. You heard it here first.
&gt;&gt;2283736how does adding to another exchange decrease its value? What makes you so certain its even going to get added to polo?the charts been pretty easy for now i told people to get in 10k to 12k theres 20-30pct for them short term by EOD.
Bitcoin: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamEthereum: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamStratis: Cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamBAT: Overpriced ICO, attempting to take everything it can from public, 95% owned by less than 100 people (35million in dev pocket)Overpriced shitty ICOs ruin a company before it&#039;s even bornDo the maths brainlets, feel free to buy Whale bags if you want to get owned
&gt;&gt;2283771very high volume with 200 whales = your asses are going to get dumped on
&gt;&gt;2283789those whales or corps who got in at ico would make a exchange account within 1 day of listing. get fucking real.
WHY ISNT IT GOING UP REE
&gt;&gt;2283802are you retarded? it isn&#039;t on polo yet.
&gt;&gt;2283785why is stratis freefalling then
&gt;&gt;2283811you just said it would dump when it gets on polo, your own fucking words... i asked you what makes you so certain going on another excahnge it will dump... and how you even know whether its going on polo?
&gt;&gt;2283785they have hundreds of thousands of users and some of the top software engineers in world on this. this guy CREATED JavaScript, co-CREATED Firefox.. he is not your average crypto scammer. But keep spreading your FUD. Are you holding green beans or whatever it was called?
&gt;&gt;2283820HIGH VOLUME EXCHANGEIT WILL DUMPWHALES NEED HIGH VOLUME AND HIGH PRICE TO DUMPPOLO IS HIGH VOLUME EXCHANGEBAT ON POLO = YOU ALL KYScan you understand that?you&#039;re a fucking retard. and of course it&#039;s going on polo. it has gotten requests every fucking day to go onto polo because the W H A L E S WANT TO DUMP IT.
&gt;&gt;2283818It could fall to $4, the overall growth is still exponential. I expect it will continue to grow in coming years&gt;&gt;2283822&gt;i bought whale bags, the post&gt;dev stole 35 million from publickek, overpriced shit tier ico scam coin
&gt;&gt;2283822So what exactly did they need 35 million for ?
&gt;&gt;2283839Dude are you retarded or what? If whales WANTED to dump, they would&#039;ve already done it. They have more ways than fucking polo.
&gt;&gt;2283878sure thing buddy, how much BAT do you own ?
&gt;&gt;2283890Only 600. But dude, you really think whales can&#039;t dump atm because it&#039;s not on polo?Go check yourself for retardness.
&gt;&gt;2283902ok babby brainlet, enjoy ur big boy BAT tokens
&gt;&gt;2283913gb2 to discord
&gt;&gt;2283878&gt;&gt;2283902of course you own some, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be blinding yourself with such obvious and typical whale activity. there is zero buy support and it is climbing to 10x the ICO. how fucking stupid are you? degenerate gamblers are the worst. it will hit polo, have much more volume, and it will be dumped.
&gt;&gt;2283785&gt;bitcoin ICO
&gt;&gt;2283936&gt;&gt;2283890Fuck off scammers. You were pulling this thing last night at 7k. We&#039;re not selling you our coins.If you&#039;re a newfag, don&#039;t be retarded. Just hodl.
&gt;&gt;2282106What are they gonna do to prevent it?
So when exactly do you expect it to hit polo?
&gt;&gt;2283965&gt;we tell them what is going to happen to their potential gains&gt;&quot;FUCK OFF SCAMMERS!&quot;like i said, degenerate gamblers are the worst.
scamcoinno one is going to switch browsers just to watch adsuse only for pumping and dumping no HODL
&gt;&gt;2282879I only bought 200 @ 7K lastnight should have bought more
&gt;&gt;2282055how is that supposed to work. can not find any screen that hints at BAT in the browser itself
&gt;&gt;2283995&gt;It blocks ads and trackers&gt;you get paid to watch ads&gt;publishers get paid when people watch their ads&gt;It saves data&gt;It saves power&gt;browser is aesthetic, simple, and easy to use&gt;Uses blockchain tech to provide real-tie data of ad-campaign efficacyThis is revolutionary tech, and it is going to Jupiter and then Andromeda.What&#039;s not to like.
Did I get memed again? Already -15% for me from my investment.

IVE FUCKING TOLD YOU MAN
Just downloaded the brave browser on my phone and its fast as fuck. Im goong in deep. Name another coin that has an actual product behind it.
&gt;&gt;2284473Told us what, that (((growth))) looks fucking shit
&gt;&gt;2284503DONT DOUBT THE TRIANGLE KID
&gt;&gt;2284503TOTHEFUCKINGMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
&gt;&gt;2284534like fucking clockwork
&gt;&gt;2284534Fuck how did i make meme triangles
I HURT MYSELF TODAY
&gt;&gt;2281741PRAISE BATall my shitcoins could go to 0, but i would still make plus thanks to the javascript meme coin
&gt;&gt;2284534Can someone explain how this works? It actually goes up.
Never listening to /biz / again. Lost my 100% on this
&gt;&gt;2284704&gt;buy at ATHive made 50% of my investment back
&gt;&gt;2284731he is showing some bug in Bittrex, because the ATH today was apparently 1 btc per BAT
37 btc buy
&gt;&gt;2284704hehe
&gt;&gt;2281741fuck I bought this shit @ 0.00127 ETH/BAT when I got the fomo. not gonna sell now, I wait until the story &quot;get paid to browse&quot; hits the newspapers. but FUCK I could have 20% more BAT now if I didn&#039;t fomo hard and stayed disciplined.glad I have some though. just should be more. overpriced fuck.
Getting coins to browse easy. Neckbeards will be all over this.&gt;&gt; posted from Brave browser
&gt;&gt;2281741what the fuck is going to happen to this coin
&gt;&gt;2282158how do you get this graph on bittrex? I looked all over and cant find it
Are you guys not worried about how quantum computing will affect cryptocurrencies?
&gt;&gt;2286498Right here yah dingus
BAT coin still doing me well. I can see it hitting $1 by the end of the week.
Can someone explain the value of this technology in particular outside of &quot;muh Java and Firefox developer&quot;? I want to buy just because I think it will blow up short-term even if it is trash long-term, but it seems like there&#039;s very little about what this really offers over anything else.
&gt;&gt;2286926Read the white paper, you stupid, fucking, nigger.
&gt;&gt;2286926The actual value is the Brave browser blocking ads on mobile while chrome browser can&#039;t, because ad block plus isn&#039;t allowed on android chrome.Now chrome is saying they will block ads on mobile probably to compete with Brave, but we&#039;ll see how it goes.
&gt;&gt;2286926&gt;browser that pays userssign me up
&gt;&gt;2286973It&#039;s a NEETS dream come true. Fuck, I could even see Section 8 people farming this.
&gt;&gt;2286955&gt;&gt;2286973&gt;&gt;2286994Isn&#039;t this extremely inflation-prone then? Assuming it takes off, there is going to be a shitton of people earning BAT.
Hey guys, wanna jump on this because I&#039;ve got bad FOMO.Where&#039;s the best place to pick up Bitcoin to load up into Bittrex?
&gt;&gt;2287063NoExchanges sell to Advertisers.Advertisers pay publishers and users.Publishers and users sell on exchanges./Exchanges sell to advertisers..../
&gt;&gt;2287602Someone please point me in the right direction
&gt;&gt;2283822Have you used the Brave browser? It fucking sucks.It&#039;s another crappy wrapper around Chrome OS.
&gt;&gt;2288090Coinbase -&gt; Bittrex -&gt; BAT.Take some time for verification if you don&#039;t have an account on Coinbase yet.
Not a bug really. This is how you bring a coin to a new exchange
Such a scamhttps://www.reddit.com/r/scamcoin/comments/1vouo9/batcoin/
&gt;&gt;2289052&gt;3 years agowrong coin retard
&gt;&gt;2289052Wtf is this bullshit fuding. The coin has only been on sale for a day, ffs.
&gt;&gt;2289052TOP LEL&gt;Batcoin&gt;BATPick one, you absolute fuding faggot.
&gt;&gt;2289144na na na na na na na naaaa nigg errrrrrrr

we all missed the BAT buy in, we could have made 10x the initial investments...dont miss this -&gt; sh0.co
brave browser is unironically not bad
&gt;&gt;2289232Seems legit dude.
&gt;&gt;2289242read the white paper
&gt;&gt;2289240This. Also if they advertise it as &quot;get paid to watch ads&quot; I could see it massively growing in market share
&gt;&gt;2281741Get on this ICO -&gt; sh0.colong term investment
Now is the time!!! Buy the dip, BUY THE DIP!
&gt;&gt;2289240The mobile Brave browser is what really shines.
the dip will go deeper but i reckon it&#039;s worth holding for when it hits other exchanges.today&#039;s short term gains coin is iEx.
&gt;&gt;2290358You don&#039;t know that though.
&gt;&gt;2281741BAT IS A SCAMCOINSELL NOW THE WHALES ARE DUMPING TOMORROW MORNING
&gt;&gt;2290528thanks whale roleplayer #321
&gt;&gt;2290528There literally isn&#039;t enough buy order book for whales to dump without it going back to the base price of what they brought it for, and then they&#039;re stuck with millions of this shit that no one will buy. Fortunately whales aren&#039;t as stupid as you are.
&gt;&gt;2290528What&#039;s changed since everyone lined up to buy this that they would want to sell it all tomorrow? The whales who bought this didn&#039;t buy into a surprise.
&gt;&gt;2290528lol, the other posters are right, there is no buy support.This criticism is bizarre, even for fud. It&#039;s like you can;t attack the fundamentals, so you make up or blow things out of proportion:&gt;muh whale dump&gt;muh whale monopolyWhat&#039;s the problem, dude. Do you not have enough ETH on tap to invest in this, lol.
thanks biz, i fucing bought it and now its fuking dead
reminder that every BAT thread has a guy who knows what is going to happen and tells you not to buy this because it isn&#039;t good value.that is the guy you shouldn&#039;t listen to.if you want bank, but now and hold for 1 year and when the ad agencies start using this it will be $5 a coin.once the aff marketing system embraces this it is going to get huge, because it allows aff marketers to keep their transactiosn away from the taxman and in the crypto world. pay in BAT, get BAT, cash out in BTC.FB will adopt this for ad payments at we are all living on the MOON
When is bat getting on polo?
&gt;&gt;2292107Doesn&#039;t matter except that it will, which will mean a yuge boost
&gt;&gt;2291302This is the guy who wants you to hold the bag
&gt;&gt;2292117Yeah, but I&#039;m curious if we have any info on when will it happen, anything from polo team or bat team?
&gt;&gt;2281741BAT MOON! BAT MOON!GET IN QUICK!
&gt;&gt;2292425It jumped 5% nigga, that&#039;s not mooningIf it hits polo, expect a moderate mooning
&gt;&gt;2284120Try browsing 4chan with the mobile browser
&gt;&gt;2292278Since there are a lot of big names behind this, you shouldn&#039;t expect a moon. It&#039;s bad for business to have an unstable coin. You should expect that the value will on average (say, week-to-week, not day-to-day) will increase moderately, and the whales will cash out in relatively small amounts over time. It&#039;s a conservative investment kind of coin, but one with potential for big payoff in a couple years if the fundamentals hold true.I feel the same way about Ripple desu, anyone worried about a month of stability isn&#039;t thinking long-term.
ok phew. sold my holding of this piece of shit coin.you&#039;d be BAT-shit crazy to buy in to this whale-owned garbage. seriously, distribution from ico was insanely bad
can this go on MEW yet?
&gt;&gt;2293225I&#039;m expecting the appearance of it on a relatively good exchange will cause a jump in the next month or so as more speculators jump in. Maybe going to a dollar a piece. I don&#039;t believe in it long term anyways so a doubling is perfectly fine for me. Let me reap my 200% gains and move on.
Stupid dump and dump coin
buy musicoin today!
STEEM is gonna be 5$ per coin soon...Press 1 for intergalactic travel
&gt;&gt;2293087THIS COIN WILL MOON! GET IN!
&gt;&gt;2293087I tried to warn these faggots but they didnt listen op. Lambo land for us then
This is what one weak of pure HODLING looking like in the crypto world.I haven&#039;t bought or sold anything in over a week. Just look at that growth purely from HODLING.
what are you hodling, op?
HODLing ain&#039;t shitI just sold my DGB, bought some VTC, and boom made way more in the past hour than stagnant ass DGB would have made for me.Bless selling high and buying low and selling high and buying low
&gt;&gt;2291856Mah nigga
Just over here holding mostly DGB and XBY.Picking the right coins is just as good as day trading but without the anxiety.
&gt;&gt;2292070Why arn&#039;t you spreading some porfit? If those fucking things collapse you&#039;re fucked
&gt;&gt;2292036You sold a mountain for a blip.
&gt;&gt;2292070Literally my portfolio rn
&gt;&gt;2292096Nah DGB is a sure rise until the 10th.
&gt;&gt;2292001Pic related.&gt;&gt;2292036Just saying, getting in on the ground floor and going long can be very rewarding. But congratz on your short-term gains, anon.I&#039;m thinking about sacrificing a portion of my ETH (average price I paid is 37.50, fees included) to get in on some ICOs and promising coins but so far most of my strategy has consisted of HODLing.Even then I&#039;ll probably replenish my ETH if I do that using a portion of the gains from such investments. I won&#039;t be day trading though, just replenishing ETH if it works out.&gt;&gt;2292042Nice, man.&gt;&gt;2292070&gt;Picking the right coins is just as good as day trading but without the anxiety.Very true.
looking for advice:yesterday i ran into someone i grew up with who made an investment in cryptocurrency (well, his mommy made it for him) and just made 3/4 of a million$. i remember not even a year ago everyone telling him he was gullible and wasting his time/money. ive never been on this board before, but no surprise cryptocurrency is the main discussion.there&#039;s no excuse...I want in. any pointers/guidance will help
&gt;&gt;2292211ever tried suckin&#039; dick on craigslist?
Jesus christ, all you guys with a few tens of thousands portfolios are just a step away from becoming filthy rich.You can easily add two more digits to that.
&gt;&gt;2292211Buy as much VTR, SC,. and CLOAK as you can manage and hold, you&#039;ll be picking looking at retirement in six months tops.
&gt;&gt;2292211Cryptocurrency is a very broad subject. Learn everything you can about it.I&#039;m no expert myself, and am learning every day... but lurking /biz/ is a good start to get a feel for things. Also, USE GOOGLE, it&#039;s a great tool and I unironically believe that people do not utilize search engines to their fullest potential (myself included, to an extent).If you cannot find an answer to a question anywhere after an honest effort, then yeah, feel free to ask/make a thread on /biz/ about it.Do your due diligence and research every coin before you invest. Do not blindly follow anyone shilling a coin. It may be a great coin, or it may be shit, you won&#039;t know until you do research/read whitepapers (Google it)/and use your critical thinking skills.I am still a small-time player in the crypto world but I aspire to be big, and you should too.Understand that investing is a risk, and that you should only put down what you can afford to lose. Sorry if I&#039;m stating the obvious here. Crypto is booming currently, however and your chances of making high gains are pretty good.Also, a week in the crypto market can loom like a year in the stock market. It moves VERY fast. Keep your cool, but we aware of what&#039;s going on.
*can look like a year
&gt;&gt;2292211there are things called shitcoins that you have to watch out for. this guy&gt;&gt;2292301is telling you to buy garbage coins because he doesn&#039;t know better or is gambling and wants company.stick to reputable coins. take risks sure, but a look for coins with uses that people would really pay for. some good ones I can suggest are GNT (cloud computing), ANT (blockchain business service suite), BAT (digital ad payment system), ICN (cryptocurrency financial/investment platform), you can see the pattern here is that all those coins are eth tokens. You pretty much can&#039;t go wrong with eth tokens.There are plenty of other options out there. XMR, ETC, XRP, hell even DGB might have a strong future. Please just don&#039;t throw money at stuff like Cloak though. Even if you do make money, it&#039;ll only reinforce bad investing habits. Do your own research, read the whitepapers of these coins. Buy coins you believe have a huge future and hold them for 6 months-1 year minimum.Most of all,GL HF
&gt;&gt;2292106But I already sold the VTC and went back into DGB, even lower than than what I sold the DGB for. And now the DGB went back up (a little bit)
&gt;&gt;2292258of course i have. where do you think i got my investment capital in the first place.but I&#039;d like to move on tosomething that involves virtually no effort on my part.sucking dick is strenuos man
&gt;&gt;2292301thank you. cloak looks good to me i like it&#039;s demographic and outlook. what are your thoughts on ETH? ETH is what a basic google search will suggest as the best investment, so I was immediately put off.
&gt;&gt;2291856What&#039;s your strategy when the market becomes bearish?
&gt;&gt;2292349this sounds great...at the moment i have about 700 usd in general electric stock that i would like to instead invest in cryptocurrency. im sure that is pretty measly but i can afford to invest it, its just sitting there.my intuituon would tell me, based on very limited research thus far, to invest the 700 into one place, that would experience a fast and sizeable increase. and after i profited and had more to work with, maybe try to spread some of my gains around, so i had share of a few different types, covering a couple of different variables, increasing overall chances of becoming rich??
&gt;&gt;2292412ETH is a safe choice but its blown up with all the headlines its gotten, it is still worth picking up as long as you aren&#039;t doing it at an ATH, if you can buy a dip and hold and it&#039;s as close to a sure thing as bitcoin. ETC is where the real opportunity for growth is though as soon as ETH moves to PoS though.
&gt;&gt;2292469from what i saw (again still trying to understand) is that ETH has big time corporation waiting in line to get in on it. which makes it sound secure and promising. cloak sounds like...well the opposite. but i won&#039;t discount the underground, dark web market&#039;s potential, because it&#039;s there and not going anywhere. they just sound like opposite...sides of th3 coin (pun intended). if I&#039;m understanding correctly
&gt;&gt;2292426I have no strategy yet. I will try to look into that, but if the time comes, I believe part of it will have to be learning through experience and getting a feel for a bear market.I&#039;m up about 11K USD from my initial investments and I started investing about 4 months ago. So yeah, I&#039;ve only been in this bull market so far.I do not plan on selling really anything at a loss and will hold through corrections unless things go terribly south. But I&#039;ve observed BTC through the years, and its ability to recover from every crash gives me confidence in the crypto market.Do you have a strategy, anon? Pointers/advice?
I&#039;m holding the majority of my capital in BTC, ETH, WAVES, in that order. Is this a bad/dumb decision?
&gt;&gt;2292153Youre sitting on lambo preorder lad
&gt;&gt;2292467Unless you are VERY confident in one coin, or are willing to put more capital down soon after if need be, I would diversify your investments. Even two solid looking coins is better than relying on one.So what I would so is lurk /biz/ and maybe other crypto communities, and start researching the coins you feel have the greatest ROI potential. Once you&#039;ve narrowed it down to maybe 3 or 4 coins, invest in those.Since we&#039;re talking about 700, two could be acceptable, but I would probably go with 3, maybe 4 good coins.
&gt;&gt;2292642It&#039;s safe but boring, you will definitely profit but you could make some bigger gains on some of the riskier coins.
&gt;&gt;2292367i would make my own thread asking for advice but my fucky phone wont let me post pix on 4chan at all, so i have to jump into other threads and bug you guys...this former &quot;friend&quot; of mine who is boasting about his newfound riches is all over Facefuck and twatter telling everybody to invest through coinbase. he is claiming to be well on his way to being a millionaire by investing in stratus. any info on either coinbase (which is offering 10$ for every 100 invested using th3 link on dude&#039;s twitter pag3) and stratus/stratis?
all you fags with &gt;$10k worth of coins, where do you keep them? hot wallets? desktop wallets?
&gt;&gt;2292677To add, you should look for coins that haven&#039;t mooned/explodes in price or market cap yet, but are accumulating a good trade volume.Always look at the charts, and review performance over long periods of time.Here&#039;s a good resource:https://coinmarketcap.com
I dont think you realize the significance of the XVG whitepaper. VERGE is literally setting itself to be THE coin for the darkweb and tor. It has just made every other dark coin obsolete with its groundbreaking Tor protocol compliance. Calling it. This is a top five coin.
HODL
In that case could Verge achieve like +10$ pricetag someday?
&gt;&gt;2290053doubtful but 1 dollar is possible. has 13 billion coins. if 10 dollar/xvg then it would have a cap of 130 billion. all of crypto today has around 95 billion
&gt;&gt;2290053who knows?just hodl the fuck on
&gt;&gt;2289983So the only question is which of those will be regulated out of existence first. How big do you think the darkweb economy is? $1 billion at best? Buy a coin going into a big space. BAT is going into a ~$200 billion digital advertising space. SIA is going into a ~$35 billion cloud storage space. Investing in this shit is a waste of time
moneroisfucked
if this somehow goes to 1 or 5 dollars im gonna let me dog fuck me in the ass and livestream it
&gt;&gt;2290126It&#039;s not just dark web, a lot of people enjoy the idea of private transactions. Most rich people try to evade taxes by keeping their transactions private
This coins only use is for ppl to anonymously purchase things like child porn, drugs and weapons off the deep web. Sorry but I can&#039;t morally support such a coin sorry
&gt;&gt;2290216cool man

&gt;&gt;2290216better throw out your USD.
&gt;&gt;2290249&gt;I just sold a coin which is mooning&gt;Now I&#039;m broke&gt;Gib me coins pleaseWat? You must have been broke before.

why would an encrypted blockchain even need tor integration?this an example of a scamcoin imo
&gt;&gt;2290831read the white paper
&gt;&gt;2290819True
&gt;&gt;2290255underrated post
Uh guys...
It&#039;s true, buy now while you can, or don&#039;t en regret it. The choice is yours.
&gt;&gt;2293796Bought a load more this morning.Lambo time coming
&gt;&gt;2293796Only 3k? LEL
&gt;&gt;2293811Maybe even more.
is it really true that i have to buy BTC in order to buy coins like XEM or DGB or can i buy them with ETH?im new, but have a good amount of ETH and want to trade
lurk moar
Vitalik ButerinVerified account @VitalikButerinNo. Casper can survive 51% attacks happening once in a while; we can just delete the attackers&#039; deposits and keep going.&gt;we can just deleteget out of eth now!
&gt;&gt;2293751Exchange ETH for BTC then buy any alt coin faggot
Went up 2000 sats since 2 weeks ago.
got it at 300 :P sold it at 2600
&gt;&gt;2293650Got in at 200, still hodling. Shouldve sold the tops and bought the dips, but I&#039;m a cautious man.
&gt;&gt;2293661you sold it? lmao
&gt;&gt;2293668That&#039;s what I do. Just made a little bit off of waiting. I&#039;ll take the risk.
&gt;&gt;2293679&gt;&gt;2293679weak hands making cheap coin available for the rest of us :P
&gt;&gt;2293650I did... but at 2.3k sat. Fuck my life.
i was convinced this was a scam for noobs, thought the market cap was all wrong
&gt;&gt;2293650invested at 1600 and again at 1900 holding like hell was tempted to sell at 2600 but i believe in it also randomly bought verge at 60 and its now 220 bretty good forst day desu
when its gonna crash boys?
&gt;&gt;2293735Not soon, it had a big correction yesterday.But shes on the climb now.
&gt;&gt;2293679It&#039;s under 2600 now, he can buy back in for more profit
All I hear is I doubled this in 5 days I trippled that in 4. Fuck being a fag that can&#039;t afford to invest 10 bucks to start making fucking gains. Tip me an amount of BTC that you won&#039;t notice or care about, make me moon for fucks sake.1LC8NGvxh1fDEh1kRU21it2874xvXoHTUi

&gt;&gt;2293063I&#039;m missing the knee pads and truck stops meme, op.
&gt;&gt;2293063sent ;)
Who still hodling here?Where did you buy and when will you sell?Bought at 155 sats, will sell at $1
As good as the whole real world gaming integration thing is I&#039;m unconvinced that it&#039;ll be the main value driver moving forward.DGB has some of the fastest transaction speeds, good security and is already used for physical transactions in retail stores (Namely in Asia) - if they pull the gaming integration off that&#039;ll be the cherry on top but this is pretty solid.Predictions on the price before and after 9th and 10th presentations?
775 I guessgonna sell when I think something else will net me better profits and is therefore more profitable to have my money in
bought at 115 - 150, will sell half at $1 and hold the rest indefinitely
&gt;&gt;2293557&gt;selling that earlyI might consider selling at $5
Noob here. Set up account a while ago after I found out my dogecoin from 2014 were worth 7 times what I paid. Fiddled around with coin as etc but got put off because only 3 currencies.Eventually sorted it al yesterday and picked up about 5000 dgb. Think I got in at 2200sat then sat there watching the losses at midnight on sat when someone dropped the price to about 1600.Annoyed really because I knew about them la week ago so even though I&#039;d be late to the party I&#039;d still have doubled my investment if I bityered to do it then.
&gt;&gt;2293557&gt; Assuming this coin will hit $1.That would leave this with around an 8bil market cap. Someone must have left the gas on, niggas are high in this thread.
&gt;&gt;2293590They alao have digisign that is citibank finalist.What i like most is this diversification and oc the persistance of the dev for 3y now
bought in 113. sold in 146. great 30% profit r-right anon?
&gt;&gt;2293557&gt;sell at 1$memecoiner&#039;s wet dreams :^)
bought in at 1800sat will sell at 18sat
&gt;&gt;2293649the /biz/ way
Sold 200ish units to top off my XVG stack, but i bought at 235 so its not really being captialized onMeanwhile DGB is moving, kinda iffed but satisfied
&gt;&gt;2293629You&#039;re assuming that&#039;s a lot only relative to other cryptos not increasing in value too.We are seeing a huge wave of capital inflows to crypto.DGB at $1 and a 8B market cap may be crazy, but not so crazy when you give BTC a 100B market cap and ETH a 70B market cap
&gt;&gt;2293704I suppose that&#039;s true. What a time to be alive.
&gt;&gt;2293718It truly is quite amazing what&#039;s happening atm, the crypto hype I think is similar to the late 1990s .com boom in many waysAt the same time though that implies a crash and although volatile, I don&#039;t see cryptos will be declining in value anytime soon. Blockchain is only just now becoming mainstream and getting true commercial implementation. The younger generation is drawn to &quot;internet money&quot; on a very basic level, it has the &quot;mystery&quot; to the older generation and the decentralized appeal to the leftie/libertarian type.What I think is most interesting is that the only thing that seems to cause declines in cryptos is exchanges fucking up (See: Mt Gox). We saw during Cyprus and Greece capital restrictions that the price of cryptos and at the time namely BTC rocketed in value, similarly with the Chinese this and last year.I think cryptos are the gold of the 21st century and we&#039;re fortunate enough to be on the frontier of the new economy.Even BTC at a $100B market cap isn&#039;t that ridiculous given the lack of faith many are having in fiat/monetary/fiscal policy.
&gt;&gt;2293629dont ignore that when (if it will) reach 1$ the marketcap of BTC will be 65/75 B and ETH around 40B
&gt;&gt;2293557ya some dumb nigger with a fake chain makes me want to buy this coin
Newfag here what platform are American coin traders using, coinbase seems to basic..

Seig Kaiser Vitalik!
Word is that Putin is using ETH to fund Assad use chemical weapons on more kids I would sell asap
&gt;Preminded 85% of ethereum in existencein case anyone&#039;s wondering...this is actually true
&gt;&gt;2289460Dgb in the Id, by what means does he this
IS ETH A SCAM?
&gt;&gt;2289367&gt;fluent c++I hate it when people treat programming languages as real languages. He doesn&#039;t fucking speak the c++. Also, leaning it in under a week is nothing to be amazed about if you know the very basics of programming.
&gt;&gt;2289367seig heil vitalik
&gt;&gt;2289367why do his lips look so small?
&gt;&gt;2289468How much does he still own?
FUCKwhy are people still using eth?Trump must be heavily invested
&gt;&gt;2289367I enjoyed this post
What is it with tech dorks looking like literal subhumans?
&gt;&gt;2289583https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0go to 1:06:30 and listenbasically ico&#039;s are illegal but I think it&#039;s more of a grey area than these guys make it out to be. It&#039;s more like how online poker was in 2010 when it was illegal but full tilt poker still advertised on prime time tv. There is still some possibility they go after vitalek and the ethereum foundation saying they owe millions.note none of this would affect people who hold ethereum, as you did nothing wrong. the scandal could affect the price though, especially when they control such a huge portion of the tokens.
&gt;&gt;2289523lmao he does speak fluent c++
&gt;&gt;2289604I bet (((Kushner))) and (((Bannon))) are the real backers of eth
&gt;&gt;2290161as opposed to JPMorgan and Microsoft?hardly sure which is worse

&gt;&gt;2289961Bateman?
&gt;&gt;2290934ever wonder why the ethereum jesus would sell all his coins but all his followers are buying them? at the end of the day what is the ethereum token actually worth? I&#039;m afraid people are being duped into funding smart contract research and well end up holding bags of worthless coins.
&gt;&gt;2291281He sold 25% of his stake fuckwit
&gt;&gt;2289367Thanks for the swift summary.

Funny that the halting problem will make sure there will never be any non-trivial smart contracts on the eth platform.You&#039;d have to be an idiot to put significant money in any complex decentralized smart contract. See DAO.The price of eth is mind boggling to me.
&gt;&gt;2293685because you don&#039;t have a mind in the first place
Okay, guys. I need some answers.After lurking for a couple of weeks, I kinda get what I have to do now, but I still need help. I want to go to Lamborghinia.&gt;First thing I should do is get a wallet.&gt;Any recommendations? I&#039;d like to invest $50 until I double my investment and then HODL from there.&gt;Then make an account on Coinbase.&gt;Invest and HODL ETH. Invest on shitcoins after.Should I open another bank account to link said card to Coinbase? It feel iffy giving some random website my bank info. At least my main bank account.
&gt;&gt;2293634Coinbase is already interfaced with multiple major American banks. I wouldn&#039;t worry about Coinbase stealing your bank info/identity, and if they try, your bank is hopefully FDIC insured. Their position in the coin industry is too powerful to throw it away for some stolen fiat.
&gt;&gt;2293634first shave those monkey arms

&gt;&gt;2292196How right you were about what?It&#039;s fluctuating because the volume is so low (and rising)PERFECT time to buy before the next pump
Do you really need more proof?
&gt;&gt;2292242How right I was about you being scammed. And you fags were absolutely scammed.
&gt;&gt;2292423Fuckig cunts, meme triangles formingHodl in morning see gains

What are your opinion on bitminer.io?Scam?Why do they give away free coin?Do you think they&#039;d really give a free Bitcoin to you each day forever if you have them 5?
&gt;it took 5 days to double my money
&gt;&gt;2290597Proof
&gt;&gt;2290603what do you mean proof? 5 days for double is below average. Lurk moar

&gt;&gt;2293354Keep it up, friend
Welcome to the good life
Imagine if everyone made a thread after making 10 bucks
&gt;&gt;2293638Imagine we had to imagine that
Started 2 days ago with $7800. Take me to lambo land
&gt;&gt;2293596You started 2 days ago, and that&#039;s your portfolio?You really just followed the /biz/ memecoins didn&#039;t you.To be honest, the shear hype generated on this board is actually enough to falsely carry value to these coins, so its fine.You could have made a lot more money if you did independent research though. Last 2 days, there have been at least 3 coins that doubled in price with some degree of stability.
&gt;&gt;2293625Yes I haven&#039;t a clue about day trading or cryptos. Which coins should I have bought that you&#039;re talking about
&gt;&gt;2293596&gt; Memecoin brotherGet some VOX in there. Been seeing some early-warning threads around here, which typically means shits about to get real.
Ark just broke 20k! Jesus fuck, why haven&#039;t you invested yet, this is sure to be a top ten coin by the end of the month.Step-by-step purchasing guide: https://pastebin.com/SaJTs2jKOther Reading Material:Roadmap: https://ark.io/roadmapWhitepaper: https://ark.io/whitepaper
&gt;&gt;2291398This coin is sexy, will probably be forced to buy more, already got 2500 tho
&gt;&gt;2291445Ikr, the wallet alone gave me so much faith
&gt;&gt;2291398Already in 600, I&#039;d buy more but that&#039;s all the btc I have :/
&gt;&gt;2291398I&#039;m putting 15k into this shit. Screencap this post. In 30 days I&#039;m going to be in lamboland.
How exactly does staking work?I&#039;ve did the voting for the delegates thing but there hasn&#039;t been a single coin added to the wallet from staking.
Holding 25k ARK here
Ark has an awesome development team! They are very active this coin will easily get to 400 mill Market cap!
buying since 10k
been accumulating since 12k, been getting hard to pick up more above 20k since there&#039;s almost no one selling anymore lol
Buying more now!
this one is going to the moon baby
only got 250 of this, my first purchase though.let&#039;s go boys
Holy shit it just won&#039;t stop
or does it have potential?
wtf
p&amp;d scheme hop on board goyim
&gt;&gt;2293583&gt;&gt;2293360
how fucking new are you OP
&gt;&gt;2293583ordinary day in crypto land
want this to happen to you? buy musicoin
Nobody on their team is an Android or iOS app developer. This thing will only be accessible from a webbrowser. The &quot;System Architect&quot; is only a marketing guy. And one of the Swarm City&#039;s twitter accounts tweets about the % increase in price which to me is a HUGE redflag. If these guys are javascript developers, why is their site so shit? The FAQ doesn&#039;t work, the advisors page doesn&#039;t work. We&#039;re going to see a massive selloff before the release of their &quot;MVP&quot;
Keep doubting, nigger. LOL
&gt;&gt;2293190lol shut up nerd
&gt;i&#039;m salty I didn&#039;t buy in below $3
Doesn&#039;t matter, still gonna moon between now and June 15
My conclusion also: if you do any research you see that this coin has no potential to create a better product than the other coins in this space
&gt;&gt;2293283And thanks to dumb fucks like you, I was able to buy real cheap. Keep doubting, fags. But remember to kill yourself when you realize what you missed out on. You can buy ropes from hardware stores.
&gt;&gt;2293588&gt;being so emotional about a coin you tell people to kill themselves
Where i can find this graphs and how to read them?
Bittrex.Left are buy ordersRight are the sell orders.More green is better. Giant leaps in either are the &#039;walls&#039; commonly referred to.
this is vtr right now. we&#039;ve gone from a sell wall to a buy wall very quickly. get ready for the moon
&gt;&gt;2293321This is the correct answer, but I didn&#039;t respond because I didn&#039;t realize that the question was that simple.Oldcoiner problems.
&gt;&gt;2293544mlady
Can someone redpill me on shitcoin mining? I don&#039;t have a good GPU and no funds to buy a better graphics card, so mining any serious coins is out of the question (either btc, eth or zcash etc etc). However, I&#039;m paying a flat rate on electricity, so I can afford to mine something which isn&#039;t immediately profitable.Thus, I&#039;m interested whether mining shitcoins is significantly easier or less demanding than mining any serious cryptocurrency and whether it&#039;s a good idea to start doing it? If the answer is yes to both, which are some mineable shitcoins with potential?
Bump
fuck me do some research cunt.you just turn on a computer, overclock until it doesnt crash and leave it there. Fuck youre a moron.Send me bitcoin 1HAeJMX7X79wiURmKkxvSkkCW9JvPbZc9LIll answer your question better and then kill yourself.
&gt;&gt;2293310Why spending time on pointless research when someone with experience can give me a general direction? No need to be so ill-tempered about it. Many people are asking about mining altcoins here and usually they are given sort of a decent answer and not an incoherent ramble. Thanks for bumping though.
&gt;&gt;2293197DGB desunot even a shill
&gt;&gt;2293376buy 8 580ssend me bitcoin and ill give you more advice
Mine Monero with your CPU. You&#039;re guaranteed to make more money than electricity costs unless your computer is old af (you need aes).
&gt;&gt;2293461I&#039;m not sure how effective Monero mining with cpu is, but with my gpu (geforce 940 MX) I can make like 20 cents per day. Using Nicehash for I was getting around 40 cents a day. Thus, I&#039;d rather mine a lot of some low value shitcoins which have a potential to spike.
Have you guys seen Parkbyte on Bittrex wtf is going on its gone insane. It&#039;s exploded with 2000 growth.
and it&#039;s about to get dumped
&gt;&gt;2293531can&#039;t believe i missed thatfuck my shit
&gt;&gt;2293531quick P&amp;D of an organized whale group
&gt;&gt;2293531Got greedy and didn&#039;t press sell at 82k satsLost 10%
It went from about 95000 to 42000 in under 30 sec and one minute later to about 20000. Now it at 40k .
Hey /biz/This just caught my eye after the recent shill thread.I watched the most recent devcast for this coin, and the CEO is claiming to achieve a top 15 spot in the coming years....Is that even possible with the way this coin works? He says that with the rise of the VR market, this coin will rise as well, but we&#039;re talking millions of dollars.I&#039;ve been looking for a low market cap coin to get into, and wanted to see what your opinions were.
Shameless Bump
&gt;&gt;2293215VR is ded.still HODL bags of VOX, waiting to bounce back so I can at least some of my investment.what a shitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2293259I mean, was defines a shitcoin anymore? hahaI didnt buy RDD/Bitbean/Mooncoin because I thought that exact same thing about those, but this has an actual product behind it, which I find interesting. Would it atleast be good to buy for the next eventual pump on this?
&gt;&gt;2293215It&#039;s definitely worth it desu, there&#039;s a lot of hype for VR these days and the marketcap is ridiculously low. Even if it won&#039;t reach top 15 the pump could be huge
&gt;&gt;2293521See, that&#039;s what I was thinking as well. Shit&#039;s only at a 1mil cap, and the devs are making weekly videos.... I must be missing something, lol.Someone mentioned in the other thread just a second ago that the devs sell off their coins in pumps.... but I really don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case considering this guy is putting his face on the product....
It looks like a breakout is about to occur and I have a good feeling it&#039;s headed up.Anyone else?
those 2 minute meme triangles sure look good
&gt;&gt;2292964Where are you reading 2 minutes?
Is Waves going to.... make Waves?
&gt;&gt;2293020Waves don&#039;t die!
We&#039;re going straight to 300k sats or more if we break 220k sats.
When did /biz/ become crypto general?
&gt;&gt;2292614Around april 2017
&gt;&gt;2292614since crypto made us rich as fuck. It&#039;s our primary /biz/
&gt;&gt;2292614After Trump killed off business and economics.
&gt;&gt;2292637Stock market says otherwise
/biz/ was a crypto fork from /g/ newfag
&gt;&gt;2292646Almost every prediction is down
&gt;&gt;2292646Oh good we get to talk economics... the stock market is where wealth goes to hide when everything else is fucked.
&gt;&gt;2292660I saw the non-farm payrolls coming well under forecasts, and the market still rallied. This shit irrational, with a hard-on for tech stocks, and a lil&#039; bit of Trump magic.
&gt;&gt;2292660stock market predictions are 100% worthlessgotta say everything seems expensive now though
&gt;&gt;2292637nice bait&gt;&gt;2292614around the mid-may boomIt&#039;s pretty sad that we don&#039;t discuss anything else nowadays, I want to start trading commodities and there is no thread about it
How does someone even invest in bitcoins? I got 500 bucks just sitting here, should I invest into it How do you even cash out? This all seems like it&#039;s fake
&gt;&gt;2292733&gt;baitTrump signaled to the US oligarchy that everything is theirs now. This is like a magic wand to kill growth.&gt;I want to start trading commoditiesIf you were paying attention at all you wouldn&#039;t. Even the ponzi-coiners round here are a smarter investment.
&gt;&gt;2292614jelly nocoiner detected
&gt;&gt;2292755i have a lot of monopoly money in my closet, same shit youre right
&gt;&gt;2292755&gt;This all seems like it&#039;s fakeMoney is about confidence in value.Sovereign money earns it&#039;s confidence through stability and growth of the nation it&#039;s from.Blockchain money&#039;s confidence is gained through it&#039;s technology.Instances of either can and have and will fail. The opposite is also true.
&gt;&gt;2292637Is that why the markets are up?Fucking leftist shill scum
&gt;&gt;2292755money are just as fake senpai, you can cash out from the site you cash in most likely, or local bitcoins for real cash thay you can even hind form the scary taxman.
&gt;&gt;2292614/biz/ 2016&gt;how do Iget moniez?suck cocks/biz/ 2017&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how do Iget moniez?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;buy DGB&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no buy RDD&gt;&gt;&gt;no buy SC&gt;&gt;no buy WAVES&gt;bitbean totally not a shitcoin P&amp;D senpai
&gt;&gt;2293341i miss the kneepads and chapstick meme
&gt;&gt;2293368Give it a few months, a lot of people are going to wish they at least cashed out enough to afford some kneepads.
&gt;&gt;2292755That&#039;s what I thought. Then someone told me to buy waves at the start of may. Now my $700 investment is standing at $2768
&gt;&gt;2293070Trump is leftist
&gt;&gt;2292614After you sucked my dick.
&gt;&gt;2293507fucking retarded
buy doggo
dont leave your frogge behind
don&#039;t stay too behind the bean
Any whale interested in pumping /biz/ bucks? I have 10k of these motherfuckers sitting (thanks anonymous)Just up its value in relation to waves and i&#039;ll buy waves and be happy forever
A thread died for this
This time we don&#039;t let the thread die.Bitbean will live forever!
give it to me straight are the beans worth it?
cant wait for this fucking bean to pluto so i can laugh at all the nobeaners who said it was a meme
i wonder what kind of level of retarded one must be to put money on a coin with a mascot that looks like that
&gt;&gt;2291055&gt;&gt;2291045i think it&#039;s worth more because i love the memesbut let&#039;s be honesti bought at 30 sats when bitcoin was worth $1500 now it&#039;s at 140 sats and bitcoin is worth $2500.So it&#039;s been worth a lot to me.Should have gotten in when the first memes were popping up.Honestly wish i bought more bitbean instead of buying posw.
ITS GOING TO THE MOON, BUY IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
&gt;&gt;2291045
&gt;&gt;2291055
I didnt believe in this shit, hate these kind of posts. looked into the charts, starting to think its worth the risk.. now i am making money. Also sprouting is very easy so free money as well.great stuff
I hate to do this but I really want to have 1 BitBean... just 1 but bittrex needs a minimum order of 50000 satoshican anyone help a brother out? I promise once BitBean has overtaken BTC that I will return to /biz/ and share the wealth that was given to me.2aq8Uvdc3qTE98T5Z4CAvQny6MBPPYxNNu

Give me 0.01 btc shit! You fuckin pleb, i sitting only on /lit, whole 2016 and part of 2017, i read so much books and i so smart, i just wanna read more books and be a greatest philosofer of this planet, i like only phylosophy and when i grab my 1 btc next year i could read more. I hate working but here in russia i never take place, philosophy never give me money, never, it&#039;s my absolutely favorite and i know i probably die from starving because here lived only people who practical enough and who can lie to each other and make really boring shit, a lot of sluts, whores, biz ppl who live here, but philosophy not. Whole my live for philosophy, and i ask nothing from it. Well, do you know what? I don&#039;t need your bloody btc, u just bait me for this thread, yea i take some money from my mother and i should give it back next day, and i lost enough and i don&#039;t know how make more because i abssolutely stupid in this, well it&#039;s my path. MAYBE I CAN GIVE BACK TO YOU MY MONEY? U NEED IT? I almost poor, and here in russia 1000$ it&#039;s so much really big money, more then in your first world country, it&#039;s 3 month payment for 95% people here. But leave this btc inside your wallet, i not need nothing. If i have luck i can make from my initial 100$ &gt; 1000$ or if i lose, well it&#039;s risky i know it. I never hold more then 300$ from whole my live, it&#039;s biggest amount of money i ever saw. BUT SUCK MY DICK YOU AMERICAN STUPID SHIT I HATE PPL LIKE YOU EAT MY PENIS I FUCK YOU AND YOU STUPID COUNTRY, I hope all of you died when time comes. I DON&#039;T NEED YOUR MONEY.FUCK ALL OF YOU

I don&#039;t know if this could help you, but it could in the future, and if you were to give me the BTC i&#039;d be happy to help you for free because you gave me the money to invest.Right now i&#039;m a NEET with around $400 in his blockfolio, and if I were to have that much BTC I see myself using it smart, with long term holds.So, if you chose me and leave some way for me to contact you in the future, it&#039;s an investment in its self. I can provide you free design in almost any multimedia for any schemes you devise, and also I am indebted to you pretty much for my investment career.

A friend of mine asked a good question about LBRY.&gt;Doesnt the fact that there is no censorship ruin the platform?You dont want to be browsing vids and see murders or gore or child porn.At least I dont. I do own LBRY though.

&gt;&gt;2293444I am genuinely interested to hear why you think so? Because other coins could potentially also do this? (but won&#039;t because they are focused on other things)&gt;&gt;2293387It may ruin a particular platform, however other distributed platforms can be built quickly and easily from existing open source codebase hooking into the LBRY API if this happens.

Negative effects of crypto?1) My friends think I am in a pyramid scheme and talk behind my back2) I wake up 5-6 times in the middle of the night and check my portfolio.. can&#039;t sleep sometimes3) no amount of gains is ever good enough, I am never happy4) missing the train on some cryptos has me stressed
&gt;&gt;22894465) I know who Vitalik Buterin and Ricardo Spagni are
It fucks with my mind when I check my coins and they&#039;re dropping hard. Then I start stressing and asking myself the important questions. How long do I stick with a coin before cutting my losses? A week of no gains? 2 weeks? I walk around feeling stressed all day
&gt;&gt;22894466) I am in a pyramid scheme
&gt;&gt;22894461. Fuck your friends. They&#039;ll be salty like a potato chip when they catch you pushing that Gallardo in 2020.2. Who needs sleep when you&#039;re making cash?3. You&#039;ll be happy when you cash out in a couple years, after normies flood the market and make us rich.4. You&#039;ll get over it. Just focus on your gainz.
&gt;&gt;2289446&gt;2) I wake up 5-6 times in the middle of the night and check my portfolio.. can&#039;t sleep sometimesThis is why I just get in for long holds and forget about it. I have in just as much as I want and I just check daily to make sure it&#039;s not bottoming out. I&#039;m up heavily enough that a significant dip isn&#039;t a huge deal. Daytrading would fucking kill me
I lost all my money
&gt;&gt;2289472im the other way around. have a chuckle and think about the money ive already got out, when the coins are tankingwhen theyre going up, im agonising over whether to cash out, whether to sell up and set a lower re-buy etc
&gt;&gt;22894464) is dead on. I hate that miss the 100%+ moon rides. I&#039;m either at work or asleep. Oh well I&#039;ll keep loading up on waves not missing that wave! (Ba dum tsh)
#1 hits so hard. I&#039;ve tried so hard to get through to my friends because I want them in Lambo land with me... or at least make gains with me but it&#039;s a scam to them. Sadly, they&#039;ll regret they didn&#039;t listen to me.

&gt;&gt;2289503In my main group of friends I convinced 2/4 to buy. It&#039;s going to be pretty awkward when they can&#039;t join the Lambo party.
&gt;&gt;2289508The answer to this one is this&gt;&gt;2289594For a while it seemed silly to be grinding for $200/day when I had 300k in gains but then I realised $200 is actually $1000 or more in the but too distant future.
&gt;&gt;2289663Find your average trade % and portfolio drawdown % (or future draw down).20% average trade * (1btc total funds / 60% porftolio draw down) = 0.333btc per trade.IF you half that number to be safe, and your system is good, you&#039;ll never go broke.
&gt;&gt;2289446I began only with some ethThen bought btcThen went into some xrpThen I went into DGB and now I am checking Blockfolio at every chance, thinking about my returns , tryng to spot moon missions everywhere.Its very exciting, I am almost knee deep in crypto , preparing for waist deep

&gt;&gt;2293103Ok then, sell any coins you have. Whenever Milo officially endorses this coin the price will skyrocket.
&gt;&gt;2293062what happened to the general?
&gt;&gt;2293315Seriously I&#039;m really close to dumping my megabag which would cause this shit to crash hard. Remember that asshole that crashed the coin with 30k? I have much much more.I&#039;m holding back in case it would pump but my patience is running out.
&gt;The current rash of bankruptcies and stores closings as well as the rise of e-commerce and discount chains means that as many as 25% of U.S. malls will close by 2022...&gt;That translates to some 275 shopping centers in the next five years.&gt;mall-based retailers to have announced store shutterings this year include department stores J.C. Penney (jcp, +1.24%), Sears (shld, -4.64%) and Macy&#039;s (m, -1.12%), as well as the likes of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. (anf, -2.40%)&gt;Credit Suisse projects about 8,640 U.S. stores across retail will close by the end of year, a far greater number than any year in memory, and worse than at the height of the 2008-09 financial crisis.http://fortune.com/2017/05/31/malls-retail-stores-closing/https://pastebin.com/t43RSPtzWhat are your thoughts on this? Did online shopping kill the mall? Should they die?
Consumerism is dead in America. No amount of Amazon memes can counter that
i honestly don&#039;t care much if malls die. after the first few times trying stuff in person, you can buy the rest online. they&#039;re not even that fun in groups if you stay there too long.
&gt;&gt;2291124I liked malls until I realized how many women looking down their noses at me because I&#039;m a white male (lowest social status there is).
Huge companies that keep pushing their outdated business model because they have no idea how to adapt?They deserve to die, along glorified fast food chains like Applebees.
&gt;&gt;2291124Malls are fucking great if you live somewhere with shit weather and need to get out of your apartment for a bit. When I was living in Chicago and Seattle, they were a lifesaver during the winters. I don&#039;t know why people are so excited about the death of the shopping mall. They literally dindu nuthin wrong.
&gt;&gt;2291124Yes, online shopping has killed the notion behind mallsThough, this will affect more of the suburb malls then the malls in cities that have attractions or hype such as the Mall of America, City Creek in SLC, The Forum Shops in Vegas, shopping centers essentially where there&#039;s already shit going on around it.When I lived in KC, the DMV was the only place open in this huge mall. It was actually pretty cool. You had to walk past all the empty Hot Topics, kids play area, etc.
&gt;&gt;2291621da fuck, aren&#039;t u supposed to be mackin on chicks at malls? sure as fuck doesn&#039;t work for azns brah.
Malls are fucking comfyFuck Amazonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUfiW3W1KY
&gt;tfw remembering those times when you were a kid and your mom said we&#039;re going to the mallI&#039;ll miss you malls.
&gt;&gt;2291629How should they survive in this day and age?Also, what&#039;s wrong with Applebees? I know very little of it.
&gt;&gt;2292159They should have been smarter with where they went into business and not have a store in every random suburb.The problem with Applebees and similar restaurants is they they basically just heat up frozen food and expect you to pay a higher price because you sit down and have some shitty service. Then they have the audacity to blame millennials because they would rather go to a locally owned restaurant where they can get better food.Those restaurants serve glorified TV dinners.
&gt;&gt;2291621&gt;Too autistic to know white males can fuck any girl they want
&gt;&gt;2291124A large part of the closures are the oversupply of commercial property following the financial crisis. Stores saw low interest rates as an opportunity and gobbled up tons of commercial space in areas they probably shouldn&#039;t have gone. eCommerce is definitely having an effect but the supply glut of retail is definitely also a factor
&gt;&gt;2291800Man, those looks awesome.Malls seemed to be great social centers just by themselves.
Malls are the cancer of man kind.Hopefully when they die consumerism will die slowly with them.Replace them with community centers and libraries.
&gt;&gt;2291686A lot of these idiots live in rural areas where malls are probably miles away and look exactly the same as every other rural mall. It does get boring. The only &quot;fun&quot; and unique malls exist in major cities.
&gt;&gt;2291124Every mall in my state is like 90% Women&#039;s designer clothing stores, I don&#039;t even know why any man or child would ever want to be there.Even the Disney store was downsized to this little cuckshed that only sells Frozen dolls.

&gt;&gt;2293001Nigga I have been holding this coin since December 2013. I ain&#039;t dropping my bag till it reach 1$
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1944858http://crds.io/POW AND MASTERNODES? IS THIS THE FUTURE OF CRYPTOS AS WE FUCKING SPEAK? CPU ONLY, NO ASIC AND GPU FARMS, ANTI RASBER
&gt;&gt;2293239Stop shilling.
XVG just released her whitepaper/blackpaper.Its possible to send transactions over tor network and i2p network.I&#039;&#039;m most excited about the i2p feature.probably the most private currency!https://github.com/vergecurrency/Verge-Blackpaper/blob/master/Verge-Anonymity-Centric-CryptoCurrency.pdf
wow so this basically stomps all over other similar shitcoins. niiice, glad I listened at 40 sats.
&gt;&gt;2292090yes, now just fucking HODL!
&gt;tfw holding 199k&gt;tfw if it reaches even 1000 sats
&gt;&gt;2292156Not even a shitcoin. I have no doubt it&#039;ll go further with enough time.That settles it, these coins are going into a cold wallet too valuable now.
&gt;&gt;2290762Dear god everyone needs to HOLD this for the long term. It is going to destroy Monero
Can this actually be huge as fuck?t. HODLer from 163
whitepaper reads well, hopefully this gives Verge the kick it definitely needs, why aren&#039;t more people getting involved in this?! I sold all my DGB for this as THIS actually has a genuine use.
&gt;&gt;2290762&gt;generic image of how tor networks work that could have been lifted from wikipediaHOLY SHIT WHAT A GAME CHANGER, IT&#039;S LIKE CRYPTO... PLUS TOR!!!
Iv got over 1.5M of these! When am I going to be a millionaire /biz/?
whitepaper looks like complete basic trash, seriously?
Still really undervalued! Sadly I don&#039;t have more money to invest but this is gonna make people rich as fuck.
&gt;&gt;2292807&gt;&gt;2292835ThisFuck off shillSage
&gt;&gt;2292807&gt;&gt;2292835yeah it&#039;s just describing how tor and i2p works, trashcoin
Tfw bought at 4 sats
&gt;&gt;2292807Right mate? If crypto has taught me anything it&#039;s how fucking clueless anyone is when it comes to tech, particularly networking.I swear the white paper could literally contain the words &quot;quantum gigawatts&quot; and people would take it seriously.
This is what a rocket launch looks like
&gt;&gt;2293080What&#039;s that?
&gt;&gt;2293099ZEC
Looks like mintcoin!
&gt;&gt;2293080zcash, dont fall for this shill
&gt;&gt;2293080Holy shit. SELL SELL SELL SELL There&#039;s hell of a correction due. with no survivors.
&gt;&gt;2293148Shhhh don&#039;t let the word out I&#039;m. I&#039;m not done buying cheap mintcoins.
There&#039;s a fuckload of volume!!And so cheap. I just got a few million! Go mintcoin!
&gt;&gt;2293080Graphs like that are deceiving with high-value coins.&gt;0.092 to 0.108Great, less than 20%.
Get on the train and fuckin hurry. No meme needed. Check the chart. Sell wall down.
&gt;&gt;2291384It&#039;s actually fucking rising
&gt;&gt;2291384What the fuck is the logo for this coin suppose to be?
Only putting $170 on, let&#039;s see where this goes.
&gt;&gt;2291384thanks OP i bought in at 59k sats lets see what happens
&gt;&gt;2291488an obelisk
&gt;&gt;2291555No wonder it&#039;s tormenting me
&gt;&gt;2291384Noticed it climbing up the ranks. Ill be happy if i double my initial investment
does anyone know why it&#039;s rising?
Don&#039;t worry about the random dumps happening now, it&#039;s just whales trying to keep the price down before the real 400% moon mission starts.&gt;&gt;2291644meme triangle and news
Looks like a shitcoin, what does it actually do
&gt;&gt;2291996it LITERALLY shits coins
LSK is taking off! Let&#039;s go boys
What are we expecting? Stab in the dark for 80K at a decent scenario, would blow my expectations if it goes over 100
&gt;&gt;2292474Previous high was 75k and I think we&#039;ll blow past that and consolidate at 70k for a little while.
Alright, let&#039;s see what happens. could be good.
So far so good.
&gt;&gt;2291384im just going to throw this here if anyone is smart enough to understand0.00070000 price897844.89327243 vol628.49142529 amount in btc798.72977748 total vol
ok, what the fuck is up with the bot with 5 btc that keeps driving down the price?
&gt;&gt;2292610I have no fucking clue what you are trying to say.But LSK total volume is 1558 BTC in last 24 hrs, not 628.
&gt;&gt;2292638im going to make it really easy for you guysIts a sell wall at 700.just below 700, sell wall is ~140 btc (accumulative)and at point 700, 628 btc worth of LSK wil be dumped.SO my opinion is sell it around 630~650 not just under 700 because noone prb will buy it.I mean somone was bold enough to invest 1.6m usd into it, they are either fucking dumb or they expect this shit to grow a bit.watch it out man
&gt;&gt;2292682666 sell and buy the dip it is. Thx anon
&gt;&gt;2292682Found the crypto newb. Those big sell walls are fake. It will disappear once price gets close. Some whale was trying to psychologically trick people into keep in price low so he could accumulate.
how to identify a coordinated pump group on /biz/&gt;check post IDs. multiple post by same ID. at least 3.&gt;no memes check&gt;shills don&#039;t post images, only text.fuck you losers. playing whale with neckbeard money.
&gt;&gt;2292723i know the wall will disappear, noone is dumb enough to dump 620+ btc worth of criptos at once.But my guess is fair amount of LSK will be dumped near that price. Most likely alo lower than 700. my guess is 630~650I mean, what do i know. im just a criptotrader on a board full of autist neets :D
The sell wall we be removed shortly before imo.There will be a sell off before the wall. The whale will buy even more lisk from the weak hands.Once the whale gets his fill the wall will be reposted higher and so on to where ever.*Minor shilling below*I find that the existence of such a big whale to a good sign for the future of Lisk.And lisk has a stupidly large dev fund if the developer does not run with the money lisk should be good.&gt;Manage to grab some coins at ico.
&gt;&gt;2292747&gt;MFW shilling actually workedThanks lads I&#039;m out. I still have no idea what this coin does
&gt;&gt;2291488baddragon
&gt;&gt;2293138Join the party, I don&#039;t think the devs do either.
&gt;I dumped 250k of this shitcoin all over you plebs at 25k satsFeels pretty fucking ite tbqhwu
ETH tokens are a meme
Good call. I&#039;m bagholding til brass, if it even comes out.
Ok shitcoiners, answer these questions to prove that your memecoins aren&#039;t in a bubble.&gt;Why should your average person ever use Bitcoin or any other crypto currency for a legal purchase where privacy isn&#039;t a concern?&gt;If and/or when the fiat collapse that I see so many of you faggots talk about occurs, how are people going to purchase or otherwise use their wealth to purchase BTC/your pet crypto currency?
proof of paymentsex
go back to your containment board polcuck
&gt;&gt;2292948&gt;&gt;Why should your average person ever use Bitcoin or any other crypto currency for a legal purchase where privacy isn&#039;t a concern?It is easier and faster for me to send ANY amount of cryptocurrency to you anywhere on the planet than it is for me to send any form of FIAT currency.&gt;&gt;2292948&gt;&gt;If and/or when the fiat collapse that I see so many of you faggots talk about occurs, how are people going to purchase or otherwise use their wealth to purchase BTC/your pet crypto currency?Nobody cares about this. You are on the wrong board. We meme, but we are here to make money - the rest is for you to think about.
&gt;&gt;2292948&gt; Why should your average person ever use Bitcoin or any other crypto currency for a legal purchase where privacy isn&#039;t a concern?- No stupid expensive fees from banks to process transactions.- Easier to implement reward systems for customers, just link the rewards automatically to their wallet.- Easy payment processing for places where banks don&#039;t care to exist.Also, for some of the coins, the user will not even know they are using crypto. That&#039;s why I like about Sia. They want to implement it in such a way that Netflix or Youtube would be able to run on top of and use their tokens, but the end user doesn&#039;t even need to know what Sia is.&gt; If and/or when the fiat collapse that I see so many of you faggots talk about occurs, how are people going to purchase or otherwise use their wealth to purchase BTC/your pet crypto currency?Fiat is not going to fully collapse. At least not in our lifetime. Nor is banking. Normies will still want their credit to purchase things they can&#039;t afford.But let&#039;s say it does. Then the answer is simple. You just get paid in crypto at your job. If that happens, the world would probably adopt 2 or 3 standard currencies globally so your whole continent would most likely be using the same coin and would be accepted everywhere.
&gt;&gt;2292948&gt;Why should your average person ever use Bitcoin or any other crypto currency for a legal purchase where privacy isn&#039;t a concern?If a crypto ever becomes stable enough for everyday purchasing then it will take over through convenience/efficiency and the basic mental calculus of trusting maths for protection of monetary value over fragile nation states ability and willingness to watch over greedy bankers who are paying them off.&gt;If and/or when the fiat collapse that I see so many of you faggots talk about occurs,literally who? no one talks about that. even if crypto takes over there will still be some fiat currencies running their own liquidity markets, hell they&#039;ll probably adopt their own cryptos eventually and become the defacto currency holders once again as they double protect value.and now the real question you didnt greentext.&gt;prove that your memecoins aren&#039;t in a bubble.it is a bubble. there will be many bubbles and many pops because there is no stability baked in to these technologies and lots of opportunism taking place. that doesnt mean there&#039;s nothing of value here. the 90s internet bubble was definitely a bubble but a couple of those companies/ideas/technologies were real and very powerful and now we have Amazon and Google.
Stuck at 580, touchin 600 going back down to 580 n shit...is the pump over?I got in at with $1K at 400.
&gt;&gt;2293132Maybe if the fucking devs fixed teh wallet we could seriously trade on it. Right now it&#039;s DEAD IN THE WATER.
&gt;&gt;2293143Long term hodl. Not good for trading rn
&gt;&gt;2293143&gt;Maybe if the fucking devs fixed teh wallet we could seriously trade on itYeah, got the wallet maintenance warning hovering on bittrex for almost a day now.Siagoys fucked it up?Some dewds say it will follow dgb, is there any truth to that scam statement?I would be very happy with 1000 sats desu
Today is the day when we reach the moon.Stay mad nocoiner
why today
&gt;&gt;2292252big release and there is a big chance that is going to be listed on bittrex.
It literally just hit me.Am I ever going to sell? Will I hodl for ever and take my crypto to the grave? How am I supposed to make a profit when I will just get more greedy the more it grows?Help.
If you make 4millionSell half
Idiot, you&#039;re supposed to slowly take profits out. You don&#039;t sell everything, but you take profits out just in case shit hits the fan.
&gt;&gt;2292877what was your initial goal? You should sell when you reach that rather than constantly changing your goal.
I don&#039;t have a goal. I&#039;m holding 8+ alts so each could do different things. I think I will however take profits slowly over time if/when the returns are high enough. I&#039;ve only invested play money so desu I&#039;d rather lose it than become a regret sob story having sold too early
&gt;&gt;2292877If you&#039;re a true believer than surely you wouldn&#039;t ever need to take it out because eventually everyone else will also be using it and you will be of the early adopter ultra wealthy illuminati in the new economy.
&gt;&gt;2293035&gt;I&#039;d rather lose all my money knowing I could have made millions than make a bit of money knowing I could have made millionsDefinitely adding this one to my list of brilliant /biz/ness ideas, right next to &quot;Buy high sell low&quot;
&gt;&gt;2293058this. wait long enough and you wont have to sell you will use it to BUY.
There&#039;s literally no need to sell of you truly believe in the future of Cryptocurrency. As long as you aren&#039;t holding meme coins the stuff you hold will only increase in value vs the dollar over time. They only time it&#039;s worth selling is to buy physical assets, like if you earned enough to buy a house and still have a lot of Cryptocurrency left over.
&gt;&gt;2293061Yeah that&#039;s a fucking gem of wisdom, holy shit.
What do you think about XBY?
Either it&#039;s a scam or it isn&#039;t, we&#039;ll see when we see
