Why aren&#039;t you holding Wings yet? What&#039;s hot right now? ICOs. Everyone wants to create an ICO. Scammers, visionaries, idiots with ideas. What&#039;s the common denominator? They need to create an ICO coin or contract. Wings makes that easy. This allows you to profit from the ICO gold rush itself, rather than trying to picker winners and losers like a cuck.There is literally no chance this thing doesn&#039;t succeed. And if you&#039;re holding tons of Ether like anyone who isn&#039;t a fucking idiot is, Wings also provides a hedge against the rise of Rootstock. So what are you waiting for? Get in it.
Because the idea behind wings is actually fully retarded.The only reason why it&#039;s grown is because crypto is in a bubble.Prove me wrong.
yeah it&#039;s a good one
why not use something like Bancor, Waves or even Aragon?
Yeah I own some because it will probably go up, but what does Wings actually do?BAT ico raised $35 million in 30 seconds. If I own Waves does this make me money somehow? Still dont fully understand the platform.
&gt;&gt;2269162&gt;Because the idea behind wings is actually fully retarded.No. You are literally selling shovels to idiots during the gold rush.Everyone and their mom wants to get in on an ICO so they can hit it big and Wings provides the platform to do that.Look at this site:https://www.icoalert.com/Look at how fucking stupid 80% of those ICO ideas are. ICOs are literally the shitcoins of 2017. And this will only get worse. More and more ICOs will come and more and more people will want to make their own. Or it can get better, if you&#039;re holding WINGS.So don&#039;t be a fucking cuck and buy in right now.
*If I own Wings does this make me money somehow?
&gt;&gt;2269188This is literally going to be on &quot;Famous Things They Said Before They Got Their Lambos.&quot;
&gt;&gt;2269154Bancor will do this better and more
Boobs for a questionI have a really tip about Sia being an underrated and possible next big thing coin.Solid development team, no crazy ICO that inflated price, and strong real world applicationsHowever I think I&#039;ve identified a large wave of selling pressure.What is the correct methodology to deal with this? Buy anyway or wait for pressure to go down and buy then? (Assuming these massive selloffs are real)Is it also possible that they&#039;re whales trying to discourage investors getting in early?Thanks
List of sell orders on Polo
&gt;&gt;2269172It already blasted past much lower sell walls on its way up here. There&#039;s nowhere to go but up
&gt;everything is getting pumped like crazy&gt;+9999999999% on every shitcoin&gt;invest in SIA 2 days ago&gt;it keeps slowly rising with ~20% gains per day&gt;coin is actually useful, is better than it&#039;s competitors and has active dev team communicating with investors&gt;when correction comes it won&#039;t dip as hard as other shitcoins pumped to oblivion&gt;this glorious feeling when you don&#039;t have to worry about anything and just keep holdingComfy as fuck.
Was it named after the singer
I swear to god if you fucking autists try to digibyte this perfectly good coin with your gay anime, I&#039;m going to be pissed. This shit is ruining crypto. I hope when the bubble pops you all just keep working at wendy&#039;s like you were born to do.
&gt;&gt;2268792Dude people love mascots. And if you think japan doesn&#039;t you are fucking stupid. Spread that shit around in the japanese image boards and win. Almost makes me wish I stayed studying japanese like a fuag
&gt;&gt;2268751How much sia you hodling and why isnt it more?
&gt;&gt;2268805Shilling is not a good thing you fucking idiot. Let the market grow naturally, or it will be a pump and dump forever. Jesus fucking christ you people are so stupid it hurts my head.
Thanks to the small ass pump i could finally break even trom this crap coin and buy dgb (and make 29% profit already)Thanks OP!
&gt;&gt;2268751fuck SIAwho /STORJ/ here?
&gt;&gt;2268863Lel enjoy your small potatoes
I can relate OP, Sia is the comfiest coin desu senpai
&gt;&gt;2268874Hey I bought some SJCX a while ago. I have on Bittrex. Will I get the new token?
Should I buy for long-term hodl or wait for a dip?Will there be a dip?
Christ, this coin is fucking skyrocketing&gt;&gt;2268951It dipped a week ago, this coin is going nowhere but intergalactic
&gt;&gt;2268838&gt;Let the market grow naturallyImplying you know what the market actually wants. Right now maybe the market wants more animu mascots. If that&#039;s what it takes for some coins to get out of the shit swamp and mature who cares. If you don&#039;t like it, maybe you should consider creating a more &quot;professional looking&quot; ad.
&gt;tfw don&#039;t know which coins to sell to put into sia when literally everything i&#039;m holding is rising exponentially except rippleWhat a time to be alive
&gt;&gt;2268874fuck STORJwho /SHIFT/ here?
&gt;26 billion supplyyeah, good luck mooning this shite
&gt;&gt;2269123Doesn&#039;t hurt to put like $10 even to meme coins just in case. Especially to meme coins that are going to revolutionize cloud storage, the technology that is not only big now, but will be very important in the future when we start storing corporeal items as data online.
With so many coins, you need to see what makes them different.Always start with the dev team.Then their usefulness.Then the news.That&#039;ll tell you if it&#039;s worth it, how much to pump, and if it&#039;s still profitable.The gaming thing is an edge, and with the recent news it&#039;ll reel in FOMOs.But the market is a beast with a mind of it&#039;s own. We only TRY to understand it.
&gt;&gt;2268751OK ALL IN
&gt;&gt;2269178&gt;go to /biz/&gt;check the coins talked about&gt;google a quick synopsis on them for like 5 minutes&gt;follow them on twitter and see how many followers they have and how frequently they post&gt;invest
Buy Siacoin NOW.Right. Fucking. NOW!I swear to God I don&#039;t wanna hear more crybaby COPE&#039;ers because they missed the SC train too.Just go fucking buy and don&#039;t question it. Take this risk (hardly a risk but whatever) and you&#039;ll dig yourself out of depression.Don&#039;t you dare miss this opportunity.
&gt;&gt;2266826dgb potential? does that retard even looked at market caps?
&gt;&gt;2266985Siacoin has more potential than DGB you fudding gaylord
&gt;&gt;2267012But does it have enough MEME potential!?that&#039;s all that matters here
&gt;&gt;2266826What Altcoin site thing should I use? I have some Etherum in Coinbase, but other than that. I&#039;m kind of a pleb.

&gt;&gt;2268761of course. it&#039;s just like SIA except not as well known as they are changing their coin from SJCX to STORJ.PLUS this is not some &quot;we&#039;ll have it working by Q4 2020 LMAO guys&quot;. You can go on their site RIGHT NOW and start using their service. Once they start up the marketing campaign using the funds from the recent STORJ sale it WILL moon and WILL be competitive with higher market cap coins.https://storj.io/
&gt;&gt;2268900&gt;STORJthanks for the response, looks pretty neat. I only looked at the chart
I bought some SJCX on bittrex, how do I get the new token?

Daily reminder that you should backup your phone regularlyAll of us use 2FA. And that means, our phone is the key to our shekels. What if we lose the phone? We&#039;ll have to prove our identity to the Exchange. Back when this wasn&#039;t popular, it meant we&#039;d be unable to trade for a couple of days, prices would remain reasonably &quot;&quot;stable&quot;&quot;.Nowadays shit has changed. Markets can go 4x as they can go 1/4x. The recovering process will take 1, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, who knows? This means you need to always have quick access to your accounts.&gt;uh, I carry my phone all the time, what else do I need?Phones get lost. Phones get damaged. Phones get stolen. You wouldn&#039;t want some filthy nocoiner to steal all your hardwork, would you?BACK. UP. YOUR. PHONEPic related - TWRP. Use it to make a complete Nandroid backup. If you lose your phone, you can get a new one and just restore the backup, login and change all your keys/passwords/etc. This way, you&#039;ll be back pumping shitcoins in no time.
&gt;&gt;2269035your phone is just one step out of the 2they still need my passwordand I don&#039;t have any of my pw&#039;s on my phone in any way shape or formim not even logged in anywhereso just stealing my phone they cant access my shekels
&gt;&gt;2269043You autistic mouthbreather, he means if YOU lose YOUR phone, YOU CAN&#039;T LOG IN FOR DAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN&#039;T 2FA
&gt;All of us use 2FA.??
&gt;&gt;2269043not what the post is about -- it&#039;s about backing up your 2FA access so YOU can get in if you lose your phonethanks for the reminder OP
Its tied to you number, not phone you giga faggot.I dont know how it works in you third world, but here no one can take my number. And i can lock it and reuse it when i lose it.
There is a backup key for any site that u use google authenticator with. I keep a copy of those so if i lose the phone, i just use the backup key.
&gt;&gt;22690512nd factor authentication? You better be running to all your exchanges and setting that up right now.&gt;&gt;2269055Exactly! You&#039;re welcome. I registred on livecoin today and remembered, thought I should remind y&#039;all too.&gt;&gt;2269058I don&#039;t think so. You point your camera to the QR code and it&#039;s up. It&#039;s tied to whomever has the QR code embedded. I&#039;m not sure though.&gt;&gt;2269073Also true, but some websites don&#039;t provide it (I at least only that code for Bitstamp. I didn&#039;t see it on bittrex)
I have a 2nd phone running my 2FA as well as a backup
I have Google Authenticator. So new phone, just sign in to google and be done with it. Passwords in 1password.Get rekt noobs
&gt;&gt;2269035what if you just save the qr code they provide? That way you can use any other phone for 2factor
&gt;&gt;2269141&gt;2nd phoneGreat idea anon, might do that in the future&gt;&gt;2269169I don&#039;t believe that shit is in the &quot;&quot;&quot;cloud&quot;&quot;&quot;.t. have Google Auth and that never happened.&gt;&gt;2269174I guess that&#039;d work, never tried it though. It&#039;d be actually a nice thing, you&#039;d just need to glue them under your bed or something, if shit hit the fan, just go down under and take care of biz.
&gt;mfw dont have enough dgb or xby to retire early
If I have a big pile of BTC and ETH and I sold them in different amounts then the amounts I bought them in how the fuck do I report what I sold them for? They are just numbers.. Like say I bought 10 eth then 3.3 then 1.2 then I sold 7 of them. How the fuck am i supposed to calculate that?According to:https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdfI&#039;m supposed to report date acquired and date sold but I have like 100 orders and don&#039;t know exactly which coins were sold at what price because they are just numbers.. How the fuck am i supposed to calculate this?
&gt;&gt;2268830It says on the form description of property. So say I buy the ETH with fiat, then trade for BTC, then cash out the BTC for fiat. What do I put on form f8949 as the price I sold the ETH for if i traded them for BTC?
&gt;&gt;2268830did you deposit in bank account? Just only feed $5k a month and you should be fine&gt;paying taxesfuck those guys
Also why does this form have like 30 columns for me to enter data when I&#039;ve made hundreds of trades. Da fuck is wrong with these kikes?
&gt;paying taxes on cryptograinswhat the f*ck? just use localbitcoins and deal in cash
&gt;&gt;2268844No, but I&#039;ve been trading fiat for bitcoin on gdax the last few days and im paranoid now. I was trying to tally everything up and this shit is ridiculous. I&#039;ve only made about 9k and don&#039;t understand how I&#039;m supposed to tell them that I bought ETH and then traded it for BTC. I don&#039;t know what the value of BTC was when I sold it and I traded ETH for BTC so many times I have no idea when I traded the ETH I bought originally. I&#039;m so confused.
&gt;&gt;2268877I have like 27k on the exchange. I&#039;m not doing localbitcoins. People are getting arrested selling on there. This is too much money to just avoid the IRS. I&#039;m not trying to risk going to prison.
&gt;&gt;2268879You really think they care about your 9K ETH? Just cash it out with localbitcoin in a crowded starbucks and get over with it.
&gt;&gt;2268895It&#039;s 27k and like I said people are going to prison for selling on local bitcoins.http://www.coindesk.com/9-years-localbitcoins-trader-sentenced-latest-money-transmission-case/http://www.coindesk.com/localbitcoins-trader-pleads-guilty-money-transmitter-charge/They only sold $1900 worth of BTC.
This makes me want to give up trading all together. I don&#039;t understand how it&#039;s possible to calculate this shit when you&#039;re not trading against fiat.
&gt;&gt;2268887Get that shit outta the exchange nigga.
How am I supposed to make thousands of transactions a year trading different alt coins and then report them as property bought and sold??
&gt;&gt;2268956It&#039;s USD on GDAX. It&#039;s FDIC insured. I haven&#039;t re-bought any bitcoins because I need to figure this shit out before I dig myself into a bigger hole. I have like 20 pages of buy and sell orders from bittrex and three pages of buy and sell orders on gdax. This shit is a nightmare.
monitoring this thread because I have the same exact concern
I know the IRS considers crypto property but how do I report what I sold my ETH for when I didn&#039;t sell it. I traded it for BTC then sold the BTC for USD. HELB
&gt;&gt;2268993Same here. Someone here must know the answer to this..
Stop paying taxes.
&gt;&gt;2268830Listen if your exchange doesn&#039;t report to the IRS, there is no way for them to believe that you are trading crypto
&gt;&gt;2269074&gt;&gt;2269079Gdax is owned by coinbase and they were ordered by a federal judge to turn over their data to the IRS. They still haven&#039;t and some republican lawmakers are trying to stop it but if they eventually do. I&#039;d be fucked. I don&#039;t want to risk going to jail and since I&#039;ve been trading BTC against USD I&#039;m not sure if that technically counts as &quot;cashing out&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2269079Pretty sure they all handover everything. Coi base is complaining to let people know.
&gt;&gt;2269139Nope they didn&#039;t comply.http://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/03/20/irs-tries-again-to-make-coinbase-turn-over-customer-account-data/#26cf8b52175ehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/05/19/congress-questions-irs-on-efforts-to-access-coinbase-customer-data/#6afc27622763
FTA:&gt;Here is a paragraph from Utzke&#039;s affidavit that states only 802 individuals filed a bitcoin-related Form 8949 in 2015(emphasis mine):The IRS searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015. I received the results of those searches. Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; in 2014, 893 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; and in 2015, 802 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;22689201st one. They were running an unlawful money business and the younger one plead guilty to a narcotics distribution conspiracy charge.2nd one. He was running an unlicensed money service.As long as you&#039;re legal activities and pay your capital gain taxes you won&#039;t have an issue.
Here&#039;s a bump
Listen, you did not. Iron hands, one must have. Weak hands are the path to the dark side.
&gt;&gt;2268893This guy is a faggotHe advocated selling ETH for ETCMeme advice
there&#039;s literally nothing wrong with the dark side you cuck
&gt;&gt;2268926&gt;he doesn&#039;t realize etc is still in accumulation phase
&gt;&gt;2268926I&#039;d say its pretty good advice, Ethereum Classic is the original fork and could be used as a store of value for longtermWhereas Ethereum is a digital fuel, so it will eventually correct to allign with its use, after the memewagon stops
&gt;&gt;2268926the accumulation thing though is interestingthanks sempai
He is about to raise the cost for his slack subscription to 1BTC per month. He currently has like 1k people in his slack. He gonna be very rich.
&gt;&gt;2268958Ethereum Classic is a great idea in principle, but everyone behind it (community and devs) is so damn angsty about ETH they solely define themselves as &quot;not ETH&quot; rather than their own value proposition. This is not encouraging. You can&#039;t build something nor convince your product is the best by whining about someone more successful.
&gt;&gt;2269005That kind of defines the coin, honestly. Calling it &quot;Etherium Classic&quot; instead of ANYTHING else shows that.
&gt;&gt;2268893wait so what your saying isbuy LOW..sell HIGH?

Does /biz/ have a general crypto discord? I know there are the mooncoin and DGB shill discords but I didn&#039;t know if anyone has set-up a general overall crypto discord.
&gt;&gt;2268947Bumping for interest
&gt;&gt;2268947I&#039;d like to lurk in one of these.
I have one for stocks/cryptohttps://discord.gg/Jtfmzu3Could always use more ppl
https://discord.gg/RdHNn5j
Just think of a month ago.People shilled XBY at 100ish SAT, making the threads about the static node architecture, the new blockchain tech, and why it could be successfulPeople shilled DGB at 100ish SAT, highlighting the gamer appeal, the nigh-monopoly they&#039;d have, and the minecraft team connectionsPeople shilled Lumens at sub-100, saying how the network could make the coin stand outBut what now?Billions of threads shilling a coin &quot;Because it&#039;ll pump&quot;, &quot;Because this one is from a jew&quot;, &quot;Because we can meme this&quot;And when there&#039;s a thread about a coin that&#039;s actually worth it, it&#039;s because it has already exploded past 500sat, when it&#039;s already too late to be an early adopterI&#039;m speaking about this as if it was years ago, but it was just three weeks in the past.What changed?
/biz/ figured out its better to make you hold their bags than their hand. Do your own research biyotchhhh
&gt;&gt;2269081That still doesn&#039;t explain it though.After you&#039;ve bought your initial share, it&#039;d be in your interest to make other people realize the coin&#039;s potential.
Yes you&#039;re bang on OP, shits fucked, the demands are too fucking high now. People shilling responsibly not more than a month or two ago would advise anons about shit like if the devs pulled off the tech, or if the idea got adopted, it would rocket in value maybe months or years down the line.Now it is literally a swamp of fucking impatient little demented bastards who are looking for shit that will go 100x overnight for no fucking reason at all, actually thats too generous, they arn&#039;t even looking, they are just fucking demanding to be told and somehow expect people to actually be able to predict that.I have spent every fucking waking hour for months going through fucking everything and fighting to keep my shit in order through this, I&#039;m willing to help but I can only process and communicate information that actually fucking exists and that is still a massive fucking stretch that involves vast amounts of guessing.
What will happen to the ETH price when they switch to proof of stake ? Moon ?
&gt;&gt;2269164There will no longer be a 1:1 correlation between ETH and ETC. ETH will probably surge for a little while, then dip, and as all the miners from ETH move over to ETC, ETC will surge a LOT.
I&#039;m about to sell all my ETH and put it into DGB when it dips. Pls tell me this is a bad idea.
&gt;&gt;2268752Why the fuck do you think it&#039;s going to dip when all this hype is in the run up to June 9th? And after June 9th is probably going to be a worthless coin.
&gt;&gt;2268752do it faggot
&gt;&gt;2268752you should probably do it now
What&#039;s happening on June 9th?
&gt;when it dipsGo in now. It&#039;s too steady at this price, I doubt it&#039;ll go below 1800 again.
&gt;&gt;2268795Integration of a minigame Minecraft server, devs are hosting some server on Minecraft where they are giving DGB away for free by playing minigames and such.&gt;&gt;2268806I dunno, this seems weird to me. Its been growing exponentially since 2 nights ago, literally Thursday night it was at 900 sats and now its boomed to almost 2000. I feel like this could be a pump and dump with a possible dip back to around 1200 - 1300 but we&#039;ll see.
&gt;&gt;2268762people said the exact same thing about XRP and the consensus
Sell lowBuy high
&gt;&gt;2268821Have a little holding just in case, then buy more depending on where it goes.
&gt;&gt;2268821&gt;Integration of a minigame Minecraft server, devs are hosting some server on Minecraft where they are giving DGB away for free by playing minigames and such.Thats june 10. and a pretty minor thingJune 9 is the reason for the hype
&gt;&gt;2268875so what happens on the June 9 fucking tell me nigga
Sell when you&#039;re high, Buy when you feel low.
&gt;&gt;2268752Do the oppositeSell DGB and buy the current ETH dip
&gt;&gt;2268839But XRP did fall a bunch after consensus, anon
&gt;&gt;2268911&gt;buy at 420
&gt;&gt;2268901This meme coin will be presented to nerds and speculants on citi tech event
&gt;&gt;2268917Consensus wasn&#039;t really a massive win for XRP itself, i think the dip was pretty much in line with how it was talked about. General takeaway just seemed to be don&#039;t expect anything huge from this anytime soon.
&gt;&gt;2268917yeah that was the pointI really doubt DGB what people think it will, all the way up to june 9th
&gt;&gt;2268752sold one of my eth for DGB and a few other shit coins on poloniex.Bought 4 more eth through coinbase.&gt;mfw the shit coins are all doubling in value.Eth is a little low but this is the refueling period and I expect the rocket to take off again with the metropolis release that&#039;s sounding like a fall release. You&#039;re an idiot if you don&#039;t hold your coins long term.
Going to buy the pre-ICO before the whales snatch it all, sempai?
&gt;&gt;2265926Can you explain how ?
&gt;&gt;22659600x9167e5ff22b4b9de23a1f16f0f5f4dff12d425cd
Didn&#039;t they say they would make sure it&#039;s not a repeat of BAT?
I tried but was turned down by bitcoinsuisse...apparently Americunts not allowed because of IRS and what not.
&gt;&gt;2265988Fault of your totalitarian burger government that forces reporting from foreign banking institutions desu, sempai.
&gt;&gt;2265988Americucks aren&#039;t welcome. Fuck off and read any ICO terms
&gt;&gt;2265926This pre-ico claims 4500000 usd already. I wonder what real ICO will be.
I don&#039;t know enough about the Bancor ICO to buy earlyWhat price will Bancor tokens be sold for? Will there be a hard cap? &amp;c.
Good. America is the enemy of the world since the orange slug killed science with climate denial.Make the rest of the world rich so Merkel and Macron can hack your next election for the Democrats. America deserves everything until you have a serious President again.
HOW
&gt;&gt;2265988&gt;ywn be Swiss
Where to buy pre-ico?
&gt;&gt;2266337this
&gt;&gt;2265926can you explain what happens to my ETH when i give it to them?
I would if I didn&#039;t live in America.
When will you learn? Get them while you still can.

&gt;&gt;2265974
&gt;&gt;2266230Since March literally every coin has x2 or higher, with a few that have x10 or higher, all shilled on /biz/ pre pump levels.Get in and hodl for a few years, we&#039;re all fucking early.
pls send DGB to poorfag, all monies tied up for bills this monthDDD2JkoT8L56baJprnELFftYQa5h2p5sPy
&gt;&gt;2266261&gt;Expecting people to send you free moneySure anon, that&#039;s how it works.
&gt;&gt;2266261sent ;)
&gt;&gt;2266258I literally just started the other day, I&#039;m just playing with peanuts at this point to get a sense of what it&#039;s all about. God damn it would have been great to have gotten my exchange approvals cleared a week earlier though.
&gt;&gt;2266261I always cringe so fucking hard at losers begging like thisDon&#039;t you feel pathetic at all? Like sure I&#039;d like free money but begging is just sad as fuck
Did I do good selling all my rdd coins at 48 sat 2 days ago to buy DGB at 900?
&gt;&gt;2266308I wish I got in at 900 SAT.I started yesterday, and I got in at 1320 SAT. I didn&#039;t even know about DGB until yesterday, because I rarely come to /biz/.

&gt;&gt;2266261Go out on the street and beg on your knees if you need money like all the other beggars.
my only regret is not buying more, but hindsight is uselessthis is just another reason why you always should control your handswas considering selling this coin when it dipped 50% a few days ago
What are the chances this hits $1 on June 9th?
Plz pump bby
Why did i not buy that mining coin at its birth. It went as i predicted
Alright, we all know it&#039;s going to happen at some point. We&#039;re at almost 90B for the third time. What time line are we looking at? 150B? 300B? When will it all come tumbling down?
&gt;timing a market&gt;timing a market which is based on hype rather than fundamentalsnigga...
I&#039;m not sure it ever will, personally I think it&#039;s the first true Global banking system being bornDefo expect a few trillion before growth becomes hard
&gt;&gt;2268999Its not inevitable because crypto currencyies are economically perfect in the sense that supply is limited by design
&gt;&gt;2268999Dips are probably going to get more severe during this time where more and more people are entering under the assumption they can&#039;t lose and are throwing too much money at it. I wouldn&#039;t even bother trying to predict this, rationality is pretty much out the window and the old whales influence will be fading.Between now and institutional money entering I&#039;d just stick to the old fundamental of bagging shit up you think are the real chances when the projects mature and forgetting about it until the real moon mission begins. Trade the big movements if you want to juice up your real bets and keep them balanced, then just cop the drop on the chin when it hits.
&gt;every single coin i&#039;ve bought has risen in price massivelythis whole thing seems to good to be true. literally printing money
&gt;&gt;2268999I hate the idea that handicapped toilets mean that only handicapped people can use them.They can use it, it doesn&#039;t mean other people can&#039;t use them if the others are full.Handicapped people can also wait for their turn to pee

i love you guys so muchyou helped me so muchim literally swimming in money thanks to you fuckers&gt;dont listen to 4chin!!!!! they are le troling u!!!kek at anyone with this mentality
Here it is, updated after a few weeks.I keep telling you bizbros to get on board. You will still 20x your cash, this shit is running to a dollar.XBY is doing the same thing, but has a much higher ceiling for potential price as it&#039;s not on big exchanges yet. Get in on both of these RIGHT NOW.
Who&#039;s balls deep in Z-CASH?It&#039;s no.15 for Market cap size (over $336,000,000). This is good as its high but not ridiculously high, room for growth, room for high value.Has superb anonymity on level if not better than Monero (XMR). This is a growing concern for those who use crypto on the darknet, not so much the buyers but certainly the venders.20% of Alphabay sales now go through Monero rather than Bitcoin. Monero&#039;s value tripled when it was added to Alphabay. Something similar must happen to Z-CASH.July 1st 2017 see&#039;s Z-CASH being added to Alphabay.Price isn&#039;t that close to its ATH (All Time High), its only $232 for 1ZEC.Just cannot figure out why it&#039;s not being shilled on /biz. It literally ticks all the boxes:1) Good news coming in distance future (sell the news).2) Really good tech (The anonymity this coin holds is enough on its own).3) The last &#039;crash&#039; (heavy dip) it managed to hold its value rather well.4) Good Market Cap.5) J.P. Morgan are using this coin to build their own blockchain and shit.6) Price is pretty low considering.Obviously I hold this coin, but this isn&#039;t a shill, this is a legit question: who is balls deep in this and if not why not?
Let me tell you why ZenCash is better...&gt;ZCash has 20% founder tax on EVERY BLOCK&gt;ZClassic is a fork of ZCash with no tax&gt;ZEN is a fork of ZCL&gt;In addition to private transactions, ZEN also has encrypted messaging and data storage&gt;ZEN has DAO governance which NO anon coin has&gt;DAO combined with Equihash mean no miner monopoly&gt;ZCash devs said they wanna help track criminals&gt;ZEN releases on bittrex VERY soon (launched 5-30)When ZEN hits bittrex, buy it and hold.
Jew coin shilled by bank with &quot;anonymity&quot; &gt; XMR ? Nah
&gt;&gt;2268764The market cap is low because not much of the total supply has been mined. Come on man is this how dumb crypto speculators are now?
I have a bit over 1k Dollar in it. Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s balls deep.
&gt;&gt;2268809You forgot to mention that zencash has a dev tax which completely defeats the purpose. You might have missed that with all the other bullshit they shilled at you when they launched.
&gt;&gt;2268963It&#039;s an 8% DAO fund. If people want to vote them out they can, UNLIKE JEWZCASH
Any darknet vendors who accept Zion cash deserve the jailtime they get when the feds bust down their door
BUY ZEN OR NOT?!?!
&gt;&gt;2268764Zcash anonymity is a joke. If it needs trust, it ain&#039;t real.XMR doesn&#039;t need shills, do you own research and read the code yourself. It&#039;s open sourced.
Actually in it made an OP doubting my decision. Looking at the general trends I&#039;ll just hold it.
&gt;&gt;2269082Be smart make your own decisions (yes)
Z-CASH Market Cap has risen over $2,000,000 since this was posted. WTF.
GUYS DO WE BUY OR NOT ITS JUST GONE UP 100% HOW HIGH WILL IT GO??IS THIS A PUMP GROUP&gt;&gt;!&gt;!?

Sooo, I have literally never come to this board before so bear with me,but I had a questions about savings accounts..Is there an American bank that lets you set up a savings account that acts like a debt? Like, I set a goal (say, $20k) and when I look at it online it shows that number as a negative that gets smaller as I put money into it.Another useful part for it would be if I&#039;m not really allowed to remove money from it until I reach the goal.Does all this make sense??
Why havent you invested in lisk yet?
Oh but I did... ;)

&gt;&gt;2269084Started with 200 now I have 4k
&gt;&gt;2269084You mean on crypto or in general?
&gt;&gt;2269084started with 500, now at 15000
&gt;&gt;2269090doing nice anon. I kept fucking up in the beginning. Started with 200 of my own, now have 2k
What is this shit and why didn&#039;t /biz/ shill it?
&gt;&gt;2268575a random coin a bunch of whales decided to pumpyou&#039;re really overestimating how much /biz/ knows about anything
there was a bunch of shilling yesterday so i bought in3x gains so far
&gt;&gt;2268575they did shill it actually, I&#039;m impressed by the accuracy of biz
it has ties with stratis and its fundamentals, look it up on their site
Yup, it got a quick post around noon pacific yesterday. Something about it being based off of the stratis system?
YEEESSSS!!! I TOLD YOU!!!!!We&#039;re heading 1200 sats. WATCH!
another comfy weekend. shits getting almost normal now.
Don&#039;t make me filter this fucking coin autistic pajeet faggot
&gt;&gt;2269029This. This is literally the gayest coin around. OP is a giga dildo baggings holder
&gt;&gt;2268994&gt;Muh animu&gt;&gt;2269040He may be a weaboo, but he&#039;s about to ride those bags to Neptune, son. And I&#039;m not even tugging on your untouched scrotum and when I tell you that.
&gt;&gt;2268994oh shit theres an anime mascot for sia?! Am I just a newfag or is this coin going to moon now thanks to meme magic?!
&gt;&gt;2269076Hell yeah we&#039;re in transit right now. Buy fast or you&#039;ll miss the moon.
&gt;&gt;2268994should I buy now or wait for correction when touch 500?
Why haven&#039;t you still bought some UBQ ?
&gt;&gt;2268238Other coins on my radar unfortunately, like the project tho.
&gt;&gt;2268238why should I buy ubq?convince me from a techical, practical point of view, without talking about trains, moons and charts
&gt;&gt;2268285Its $ETH $STRAT $WAVES tier, and on $60mill market cap
&gt;&gt;2268346that wasn&#039;t too convincing desu
&gt;&gt;2268357It&#039;s a ready-to-go Ethereum for enterprise grade projects. Literally a fork of ethereum but with the guarantee that it&#039;s not in an &quot;alpha stage&quot;. I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s better, just more stable and less prone to change. It is like a friendlier ETC but with active developers. So :- quality developers (Julian from Bittrex is one of them if that rings any bell, the guy who audits the code of all cryptos who enroll for Bittrex) who work on this project on their free time withtout any remuneration- no ICO, no premine, even the developers don&#039;t have a premined stash- the recent growth of the coin is baffling (more than 1M$ volume on Trex, quadrupled in value in less than a week and yet still undervalued)I&#039;m sitting on 20K right now, doing it for the long run.
its my second biggest hold aside from stratis
Man, I hope Polo adds it in the near future.
&gt;&gt;2268783&gt;man I hope polo adds itI used to say the same thing, but the fact BIitrex is starting to add coins more frequently than polo tells me that either A: bittrex is growing or B. polo&#039;s platform is weakening.Very cautious about trading on that site atm, but I would love some additional volume on this coin if I manage to get some before the end of the month.
Ubiq is definitely a sleeper , could be the next stratis style rocket ship
just offloaded all minethanks for the easy money
i did it a while ago... when do i sell off kek?
&gt;&gt;2269033lmao my order book looks alot like yoursthe price seems so manipulated but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it kept going up because at this point it has alot of momentum.

I am sending this message from the year 2025. Things are looking bleak here, and some of you will carry blood on your hands.If you don&#039;t believe me, please move on, as I have no way of proving to you I&#039;m really who I claim to be.I don&#039;t want to waste any of your time, so I&#039;m merely going to explain what happened.On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there&#039;s a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there&#039;s no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today&#039;s world. Land and cryptocurrency.There are just over 19 million Bitcoin known to be used in the world today, as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost, and we&#039;re still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today. On average, this means the average person owns just under 0.003 bitcoin. However, due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world, the mean person owns just 0.001 bitcoin. That&#039;s right, most of you reading this today are rich. I personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old Reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0.01 Bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a &quot;faggot&quot; when he was a 16 year old boy. Upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket, left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a Citadel.
What is a Citadel?&quot; you might wonder. Well, by the time Bitcoin became worth 1,000 dollar, services began to emerge for the &quot;Bitcoin rich&quot; to protect themselves as well as their wealth. It started with expensive safes, then began to include bodyguards, and today, &quot;earlies&quot; (our term for early adapters), as well as those rich whose wealth survived the &quot;transition&quot; live in isolated gated cities called Citadels, where most work is automated. Most such Citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where Bitcoin mining machines are located. The company known as ASICminer to you is known to me as a city where Mr. Friedman rules as a king.In my world, soon to be your world, most governments no longer exist, as Bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens. Most of the success of Bitcoin is due to the fact that Bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government. Whereas people entering &quot;rogue states&quot; like Luxemberg, Monaco and Liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth, no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in Bitcoin.
Governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying Bitcoin, which just made the problem worse, by increasing the value of Bitcoin. Governments did so in secret of course, but my generation&#039;s &quot;Snowdens&quot; are in fact greedy government employees who transferred Bitcoin to their own private account, and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money.The four institutions with the largest still accessible Bitcoin balance are believed to be as following:-ASICminer - 50,000 Bitcoin-The IMF&#039;s &quot;currency stabilization fund&quot; - 70,000 Bitcoin-Government of Saudi Arabia - 110,000 Bitcoin-The North Korean government - 180,000 BitcoinEconomic growth today is about -2% per year. Why is this? If you own more than 0.01 Bitcoin, chances are you don&#039;t do anything with your money. There is no inflation, and thus no incentive to invest your money. Just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth, as wealth was measured in gold, our society has no economic growth either, as people know their 0.01 Bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime. The fact that there are still new Bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems, but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy.
What happened to the Winklevoss twins? The Winklevoss twins were among the first to die. After seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society, terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of Bitcoin, or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency. Ironically, these terrorist movements use Bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations.Most people who own any significant amount of Bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends, because they had to change their identities. There have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag-holders, the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse, even after hearing the rumors of governments buying Bitcoin. Many people were taken hostage, and thus, it is suspected that 25% percent of &quot;Bitcoin rich&quot; actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password.Why didn&#039;t we abandon Bitcoin, and move to another system? Well, we tried of course. We tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency, but nobody with an IQ above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer. After all, why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline? The thing that made Bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful. Bitcoin allows us to give into our greed.
In Africa, surveys show that an estimated 70% of people believe that Bitcoin was invented by the devil himself. There&#039;s a reason for this. It&#039;s a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as &quot;the tragedy&quot;. The African Union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to Bitcoin. Governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free, tied to their government ID, and thus government sought to integrate Bitcoin into their economy. All went well, until &quot;the tragedy&quot; that is. A criminal organization, believed to be located in Russia, exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones. It&#039;s believed that the entire continent of Africa lost an estimated 60% of its wealth in a period of 48 hours. What followed was a period of chaos and civil war, until the Saudi Arabian and North Korean governments, two of the world&#039;s major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system&#039;s unique ability to adapt to the &quot;Bitcoin challenge&quot;, divided most African land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local African population for it.
You might wonder, what is our plan now? It&#039;s clear that the current situation can not be sustained, without ending in a nuclear holocaust. I am part of an underground network, who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the Internet itself. We have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines, which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents. After this has been successfully achieved, we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world. We believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world&#039;s population to rise up in revolt, and destroy as many computers out there as possible, until we reach the point where Bitcoin loses any relevance.Of course, this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths. This is a price we are forced to pay, to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite.This is also the reason we contacted you.It doesn&#039;t have to be like this. You do not have to share our fate. I don&#039;t know how, but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy. I know this is a difficult thing to ask of you. You believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies.However, I have seen where it ends.

A for effort. C+ for actual story, if it had less inconsistencies it would be better. Funny nonetheless, I actually wrote an article somewhat similar to this a few months ago, but in my article Nigeria and Ghana became the most wealthy countries in the world.

Not bad
&gt;only 2 million BTC are lost
Swarm City will release Boardwalk on June 15th. Boardwalk is their Minimum Viable Product. Their first release was Terminal which is a wallet and is accesible right now on swarm.city, and their third release after Boardwalk will be Storefront (but you don&#039;t need to even think about that one yet, it&#039;s just good to know more is coming).Okay, so now that I got your attention, I don&#039;t think I have ever seen such good odds for a 10 bagger in such a short period of time.Not only will the devs at Swarm City release their unique platform (nobody else is doing what they are doing in crypto) in two weeks, they will also release a new website before the launch to actually give people an idea of what Swarm City is about.So let me give you a hint of what Swarm City is about: SC is a commerce meta-platform where anyone can create a hashtag like #needaride or #cash4btc (can be location specific). So whenever someone creates a hashtag they will become the de facto business owner of that hashtag, and people will be able to transact with eachother under that hashtag by making use of a smart contract (the hashtag creator/maintainer will be the arbiter and decides what % of the transaction to pay himself as fee). You also get reputation points for successfully completing transactions so you will know who to trust. So basically you could set up an Uber or localbitcoins type business up on Swarm City or any business that you could think of really and you don&#039;t have any regulation stuff to worry about because it is decentralized and impossible for a government to take down.If you go to their current website it&#039;s already clear the Swarm City team are great at marketing. This ain&#039;t no amateur show.What really makes the value proposition of this coin so good right now though is that it is totally under the radar because the website is so cryptic and nobody really understands what it is about. Not for long anymore.Thank me in two weeks for giving you the heads up /biz. I&#039;m all in.
This is how you value invest in crypto.Also good to know that on June 15th they will limit the platform to 1 hashtag #Pioneer. After a couple of days that limit will be lifted though and everybody will be able to create their own hashtags.
Interesting... how do you feels it compares to Bitbay&#039;s concept ?
&gt;Enabled by the SWT token, runningon the Ethereum blockchainzz
&gt;&gt;2267641ICO?
&gt;&gt;2267641noice and it&#039;s flat as fuck, totally premooned.
Or you can get dgb as we rocket from 2k to 10k sats. Why are investing in worthless shit?
the fuck kind of cryptocurrency name is swarm city
&gt;&gt;2267685Bitbay is an exchange. Swarm City will enable any type of business to operate, the use cases are only limited by the creativity of the users. And most of all you will be able to do it without some middle man snooping off 20% of your revenues.
&gt;&gt;2267691&gt;&gt;2267685Have you not realized by now everything is pumping like mad?Who cares just jump in the chart looks good.
INPicked up 100. Thx OP.
&gt;&gt;2267701No Swarm City has been in development for a year. The profits are going to be reaped on June 15th and nobody here is even aware.I predict the floodgates will burst once they release their improved site before June 15th.
Seems interesting OP, how do I buy?
&gt;&gt;2267727That&#039;s what makes Swarm City so good. It&#039;s not just some pump and dump scheme. It&#039;s a legit platform that actually has massive potential and I think it makes use of crypto that gives it unique advantage. Swarm City will be one of a kind, for now at least.
price looks good no pump yetwhere can we buy
&gt;&gt;2267641whats a good entrybelow 100k sat?
&gt;&gt;2267710In this thread we are value investing. If it doesn&#039;t hurt at least a little to buy in, you are doing it wrong.However unlike old school value investors, you don&#039;t have to sit for 2-3 years on your investment and hope the value will be recognized.We know what the catalyst is going to be that is going to unlock the value, and it is June 15th. You know it&#039;s priced it for the reasons that I mentioned in my original post and because it&#039;s obvious that 95-99% of people on this board have never even heard of Swarm City, and in the off chance that they did they have no clue what it&#039;s about.
&gt;&gt;2267788Correction: meant to say &quot;You know it&#039;s not priced in...&quot;
&gt;&gt;2267755Anywhere around 100k sats and you are gold in my opinion.This thing is going to go to the moon in two weeks so entry is not that important. What&#039;s important is that you are on the rocket before it takes off.
&gt;&gt;2267828had this in my top3-whats-next alreadygoing to get a nice stash!
Well I just googled into this, and this appears to be a project that rose from the ashes of arcade city coin which turned out to be some massive scam?Whats there to stop this just being scam again?And quite frankly the marketing so far has been rubbish, trying to even understand what the fuck this coin did was a pain, their bitcointalk thread is in shambles basically and barely explains a thing. The website is also a fucking shitshow that barely explains anything and runs like trash. so idk why you saying they are good at marketing, doesnt seem they have really tried yet which would make sense since the app is out yet.Havent finally understood wtf they are on about though it does seem like a great idea, seems suss though since it comes from arcade coin and they havent really shown off the application as functional yet except for one blockchain transfer test in a pretty poor gui?Unless im mistaken and they have somewhere shown off the app???
Why do I need a hashtag to trade under? Why wouldn&#039;t I create my own and trade under that for no fees? Why not just send the payment directly?This sounds like a normal wallet, but you add a referee tag to who you send a fee for each transaction.
&gt;&gt;2267850I think this will be the best &#039;I told you so&#039; of my life. There have been many ten baggers in crypto before, and there will be many after this. The difference here is that a 5x is virtually a sure thing and I estimate that a 10x happening in the next month has like odds of 80%.
&gt;&gt;2267944Because he&#039;s holding
If you don&#039;t know why this is a scam then you don&#039;t deserve to be rich.
&gt;&gt;2267944They rebranded from Arcade City to Swarm City and ousted the scammer CEO. The team right now is very solid and transparent. Visit the slack. Read their blog posts.Your opinion is exactly why this coin is going to do amazing. They are launching a new website in the coming 10-12 days to give people a better idea of what Swarm City is about + they will release their functional application June 15th. Again check the slack if you are curious to see what it will look like. But it will have all the functionality of the hashtags I described. They have been working on it for months.The next update after this is Storefront which will provide context dependent GUIs so you will be able to hook up the Swarm City API to any app and have the same experience as you would using Uber for example, while being totally decentralized and without having to pay any middle man.
&gt;&gt;2267991Does that stop this from being a buy the rumour sell the news scenario?
&gt;&gt;2267991Are you still going to mindlessly say it&#039;s a scam once they release Boardwalk and people are going to start using the platform?If you want to explain to me why you think it&#039;s a scam please do so. I&#039;m all ears.
&gt;&gt;2268007What do you mean not having to pay a middle man? In the OP itself&gt;the hashtag creator/maintainer will be the arbiter and decides what % of the transaction to pay himself as feeThere clearly is a middleman, the creator of the hashtag. In your example Uber would still take a cut of every transaction.So again, what makes this useful? Why pay extra to pay thru a hashtag, when you can pay without one even easier?
&gt;&gt;2267991From my basic research it seems to be the previous coin was run by a scumbag CEO that the team hated so they hardforked off it into swarm city, which does raise some suspicions but otherwise i cant find much to say its a scam coin, so give some reasoning as to why??&gt;&gt;2268007I&#039;ll go on slack and look around, holy fuck they need a new website the current one is complete trash.&gt;&gt;2268012If XRP can rise to its current prices, then any coin can lmao
I like the idea of the currency but it&#039;s so new and shady.Could go either way so I&#039;ll get maybe $40 and wait
We&#039;re off to the moon boys
&gt;&gt;2268058Uber takes a 20% fee. They have to because they have to pay for a lot of overhead costs.On Swarm City you are correct that a small % of the total transaction amount will go to the hashtag maintainer, but the only costs he has is playing the role of an arbiter which is necessary function. But the fee on every transaction will be max 2-3%.This is because you essentially have an environment of perfect competition where anyone can set up a hashtag and compete for the lowest % fee.What I mean by not having to pay a middle man is not paying for all the unnecessary overhead costs that are associated with normal businesses.
One of the reasons why their website is pretty shitty is because it runs completely client side, similar to MyEtherWallet. That&#039;s the trade-off you have with decentralized applications.But as I said they are working hard on a new website which should give people a better idea of what this is all about.
got in sub-100klets go boys!
So what&#039;s the ticker and where can i buy?
&gt;&gt;2268156SWTbittrex
&gt;&gt;2268156SWT on Bittrex or Shapeshift.Shapeshift does not accept scam coins by the way.
&gt;&gt;2267737You&#039;re welcome. All you have to do now is sit on your but and be patient until June 15th arrives.
Not really convinced desu senpai, I&#039;ll stick with Bitbay for now
&gt;&gt;2268104I agree their past was shady, but it was only related to one individual. The current team is pretty awesome.You can always wait of course. Just know that the big money is never made after the rocket has taken off. It is made before.
&gt;&gt;2268249Here, watch this senpai. I guarantee you will be sold on the concept.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xljDR4yDd4c
&gt;&gt;2267641And why are you telling us about this? What is your motive?
not sure if you&#039;re the same guy, but your thread and your writing-style in general reminds me about the last two shilling-threads, which made me actually buy something.these were RDD at 5sat and DGB at 113 Sat.Made a lot of money on those and I will ride this rocket now, too.thanks OP!
&gt;&gt;2268077Ok finished doing a bunch of research, going in with 250us most i can afford rn desu. OP isn&#039;t shitting this coin is pretty solid once you get a grasp on it, information is fucking disorganized though, check out the video below for things to actually be explained. Slack channels good to check out too, I like the old lady lmao&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xljDR4yDd4cHow the fuck did you even find this coin OP, feed me your ways so I may moon more often and never wagecuck again
&gt;&gt;2267641Project looks meh, website is meh, whitepaper is meh. ONly thing making me considering buying it is that the Master of Autismo aka Dmitriy Buterin, father of the autistic paradigm officially endorses Swarm City
&gt;&gt;2268605where&#039;s the whitepaper? i&#039;m trying to find it. there&#039;s only the &quot;convert arc to swt&quot; whitepaper which pertty much says nothing about what it actually is
&gt;&gt;2268376this
&gt;&gt;2268376My motive is spreading awareness. Also as I said I am all in so I have an interest in getting the word out. I have no more fiat to invest so there&#039;s no point anymore in keeping it quiet
&gt;&gt;2268428That was not me and believe it or not this is the first time I publish my investment thesis on /biz.That should tell you something.It means I&#039;m serious about this.
&gt;&gt;2268789&gt;you get reputation points for completing transactionswhat&#039;s stopping a guy from creating many fake accounts and transacting to himself to increase his reputation?
&gt;&gt;2268514Yeah there&#039;s a bunch of normies who follow Swarm City because they have crazy good on the ground marketing, and the product isn&#039;t even out yet. That should tell you this thing has actual potential to go mainstream.Also contrary to what some anon said here previously, I don&#039;t think their marketing is shit. It&#039;s very solid. They are doing all the right things like doing outreach on the ground/organizing events/interviews/new website/new marketing tools for the launch of Boardwalk. Also their spokesperson Mathew Carano is a master communicator. Once he does some more interviews/appearances and people get to know him I promise you they will 100% buy the vision they will flock to Swarm City.
&gt;&gt;2268789also, are new swt created? what is the rate of inflation
&gt;&gt;2268643They have a whitepaper but it is fairly outdated. They brand forked from Arcade City to Swarm City and broadened their mission from just making a ridesharing app to include all types of businesses.
&gt;&gt;2268850The inflation is 0%. There are a total of 9.5m SWT tokens. But some still have to be converted from ARC to SWT so in coinmarketcap you only see 6.5m SWT tokens.
&gt;&gt;2268846looking at their bitcointalk announcement, youtube, and website currently it is very shitty marketing. right now you have to do a lot of work just to find out what this thing is. it&#039;s a very interesting idea though
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL /BIZ ABOUT THIS FOR 3 DAY NOBODY LISTENS TO MEoh well get the fuck in here we meme this now. way better that digishit
&gt;&gt;2268840The same thing that stops someone from spamming the blockchain. Transaction fees.
bumpgtf in here /biz/
&gt;&gt;2268884Yes I agree. But what&#039;s the point of investing if everything is perfect? In 99 of 100 cases the price will already reflect that and you will be overpaying.What makes the value so great here is that Swarm City is actually a super solid concept once you get your head wrapped around it, right now you just have to do some serious digging to understand it. But this will change.Once they have their new website and Boardwalk ready by 15th June the hard to understand aspect will disappear and the super solid concept will be all that is left.Suddenly everybody is going to realize that this is an actual gem in crypto, and that is when the FOMO will start.So the point is that you are not investing in what it is now, but in what it will be in two weeks. And it will be great.
&gt;&gt;2268898will boardwalk offer a &quot;global&quot; hashtag e.g. for online work, it looks like it&#039;s just going to be geolocation based
&gt;&gt;2268988doesn&#039;t matter; will pump
&gt;&gt;2268988On June 15th you&#039;ll be limited to the #Pioneer hashtag. After that everyone is going to be able to set up their own hashtag. You will be able to choose yourself if you want the hashtag to be location based or not. For certain applications that makes sense, for others it doesn&#039;t.
ITS TIME TO STOP SHILLING DGB
&gt;&gt;2268605Having Dmitry Buterin as advisor is another data point which should solidify that this is not a &#039;scam.&#039;I agree 100% that the website and whitepaper are meh. The website is changing in 10-12 days and who cares about the whitepaper..The project is far from meh. Watch the video that is linked in this thread.

You are programmed to believe you won&#039;t succeed. This is why succes will make you feel uncomfy.No gains are made being comfy.
DAFUCK?I GOTTA PAY TAXES ON EACH FUCKIN TRADE AND NOT JUST ALL THE MONEY IVE MADE IN TOTAL?DAFUCK?NIGGA WAT WAT WATREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
stfu
&gt;I bought x coin at x date, it&#039;s now worth x&gt;pay x taxes&gt;problem solved
&gt;&gt;2264312B..but ive moved my crypto to so many places and have pumped/dumped bits and pieces this will be so hard to do....
&gt;&gt;2264326exactly HOLY SHIT im literally fucked
&gt;&gt;2264312
&gt;&gt;2264326&gt;&gt;2264328Don&#039;t the brokerages Poloniex/Bittrex keep records of all trasanctions?I&#039;m more curious as to exactly how much you&#039;re taxed, as in percentage wise to add to trade fees and figure out if somethings a profitable move or not.
I can see someone creating a tool that imports trade history and then spits out tax info.
&gt;&gt;2264359Isn&#039;t this like re-taxing someone after buying a house because it went up in priceWhat the actual fuckHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
&gt;&gt;2264359yes they do but ive moved them to other exchanges and lost and gained so many times. FUCK they dont know if i traded crypto, so I think if you withdraw maybe a few hundo a week youre fine
&gt;if YOU can&#039;t find the transaction history anyplace&gt;it probably wasn&#039;t reported to the IRS
&gt;&gt;2264312just pay capital gains on what you put in and what you took outfuck the irs
&gt;&gt;2264401is this legal? this is exactly what i want to do, can i xchange my crypto to usd and pay capital gains on that bitch?
&gt;&gt;2264382https://bitcoin.tax/
&gt;paying taxes
&gt;&gt;2264410I doubt they would look any further
If they want &quot;their&quot; money they can write me a fucking letter . Or 2 or 3 because I&#039;ll ignore them.
&gt;&gt;2264410As long as you pay them something I doubt they&#039;ll care too much, unless you made like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Honestly, stop day trading and make a ton of transactions. It&#039;s not hard to do if you just buy and hodl, very few transactions you have to record then.
&gt;&gt;2264312Welcome to the club, taxation IS theft.You think those taxes are helping your country in anyway? lmao no
OP is wrong.Most altcoin transactions are nontaxable events because many altcoins have no direct value in USD.Trading BTC for ETH and vice versa are taxable, but BTC for XRP and back cannot be taxed.
&gt;&gt;2264424*goes to jail*
&gt;&gt;2264312Wait for Trump&#039;s capital gain tax cuts stupid goy
&gt;&gt;2264501Why would BTC and ETH be taxable but not BTC -&gt; some shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2264526Ethereum has direct value in USD.For example, you can buy it on Coinbase for USD.You cannot buy XRP with USD directly. USDT isn&#039;t USD.
What the hell is everyone talking about?Buy bitcoin &gt; Move to another address.If anyone asks, you purchased/donated whatever the money.In X months/years time if you want to withdraw money, list it as income!Its not that hard.
&gt;&gt;2264545i lost all my bitcoin in a tragic boating accident
&gt;paying taxes on cryptoyou wat mate
&gt;&gt;2264312&gt;reported
&gt;&gt;2264411Thank you so much for recommending this, never heard of it.
Also, this is FUDyou only need to track all that shit if you want to pay something other than straight income tax, IRS is totes fine with you paying tax on net gains as Other Income
Let&#039;s say you become a millionaire... Can&#039;t you move to a country where there is no capital gains tax, open a bank account, and withdraw everything?Am I missing something?
&gt;&gt;2264605Wut? Why would you pay tax in income when you can pay it in capital gains for a long term asset (aka 15% for liquidating BTC one year after you purchased it)?&gt;https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/74789/do-altcoin-trades-count-as-like-kind-exchanges-deferred-capital-gains-tax&gt;So therefore by the IRS&#039; own guidance, you are trading property for property. Which in some cases is privy to like-kind treatment where capital gains tax events are no longer created upon liquidation into another like property until settled in a national currency.FYI this might change soon though.
&gt;&gt;2264501lmao enjoy getting audited&gt;&gt;2264605no, they arent&gt;&gt;2264678you can try but no third world shithole is going to do that for you unless you are ultra rich
&gt;&gt;2264526Because they have direct USD value. As sites like Coinbase add more coins, those too will have a USD value and become taxable.
&gt;&gt;2264678As long as you&#039;re a US citizen you owe Uncle Sam a cut no matter where you are in the world.
Does anyone know how this works for Australians? I&#039;d give my crypto away before I give 50% of it to clowns in parliament
&gt;Paying taxes on cryptoStop fucking doing this, for fuck&#039;s sake.
&gt;&gt;2264469&gt;Welcome to the club, taxation IS theft.&gt;You think those taxes are helping your country in anyway? lmao no&gt;what are roads&gt;what is the military&gt;what is the police&gt;what are firemen&gt;what are electricity sources&gt;what are laws and regulations to keep you from getting fucked
&gt;&gt;2264806&gt;t. someone posting from a country that doesn&#039;t even have a government
&gt;&gt;2264780Fuck the system completely, just denounce your US citizenship
&gt;&gt;2264744&gt;no, they arentYes, they are.Tracking is required to prove that you&#039;re actually entitled to long-term cap gains rates, if you aren&#039;t trying to claim it they won&#039;t fucking care&gt;&gt;2264680because documentation requirements are fucking insane for this shit
And how the fuck is the government gonna know about my trades on exchanges and between places?
&gt;&gt;2264872you must be buying shit then, I&#039;m not about to pay more than 30% on 80k. shit man get some standards.
&gt;&gt;2264880by demanding to see how you, a pathetic neet made a whole 3.50 in a month
&gt;&gt;2264880they don&#039;t have to. they&#039;ll see you as a crypto user because your cash in/cash out doesn&#039;t add up, then audit the fuck out of you.
&gt;&gt;2264900So pretty much the only time I&#039;ll need to pay capital gains tax is when I cash out fully. I intend to stay in for a while anyways
&gt;&gt;2264525THIS
&gt;&gt;2264908NOyou need to pay on every transaction and they will pursue it because you&#039;ll be trying to claim 15% on long terms when a lot of your shit may be short term
&gt;&gt;2264564F
&gt;&gt;2264812If you think even 5% of your taxes are going to anything you listed (besides the military which takes 54% of your taxes lmao) you&#039;re just wrong.
NO YOU FUCKING IDIOTSYOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY TAX ON PROFITS WHEN YOU CASH OUT TO USD
&gt;&gt;2264535You can directly buy XRP at Kraken
&gt;&gt;2264564&gt;&gt;2264920&gt;&gt;/k/
&gt;&gt;2264410what are they going to do? How are ((they)) going to have access to information that you don&#039;t have?
&gt;&gt;2264312Nope, only when you cash outhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/102300.asp
&gt;&gt;2264312&quot;i was given x amount of btc on my coinbase amount for x job&quot;pay my 15% and call it a day.no problem there. as far as the kikes know i never traded crypto just received payment.
Im so confused...So do we pay taxes when we switch to USD or do we pay taxes regardless?
Doesn&#039;t that still equal the same amount?Say you trade 3 times, scoring 100$ of profit each timeSo you pay 10% of each 100$ profit, that&#039;s 30, or you can pay 10% of the 300$ total, that&#039;s still 30Am I missing something?
&gt;&gt;2264988This.IRS gives no fucks about how many meme coins you mine, exchange etc. Its only when you cash out in USD or other fiat currency will Uncle Sam come knocking at your door.Also. /x/ tier idea, but I believe Coinbase is an arm of the IRS. Nobody has that much capital Especially after this BTC pop , and can continue to pay out like they are doing.
&gt;&gt;2264394&gt;get audited by IRS&gt;they notice undeclared income&gt;have to pay it with interest and fines
&gt;&gt;2264819Maybe that&#039;s part of the solution. Cash out in a foreign country that doesn&#039;t try to kike you.What countries are good for turning crypto back into fiat?
&gt;&gt;2265144Every sell (even between cryptos) is a taxable event regardless of whether you &quot;cash out&quot;. That being said, you only pay taxes on the profits, and they&#039;re negated by your net losses, so it really makes no difference how many transactions you made.
&gt;&gt;2264918Stupid goy, it&#039;s never happening for you.
You&#039;re all idiots. OP is not talking about cryptocurrency trading. Part of the many reasons why I stopped trading stupid worthless stocks on the stock market, besides them being worthless, is the retarded shit you have to deal with, like the way you have to report your trades or you&#039;ll end up owing way more than you&#039;re supposed to. Too much bullshit, and all stocks are blatant scams anyway, why bother.
&gt;&gt;2264312they say real time trading doesnt exist on most stock trading apps, when really theyre just calculating their profit out of your gains.
&gt;&gt;2265129you pay the overall capital gain, dont report each and every individual trade ffs retard
&gt;&gt;2264936i think most people know this but everyone just wants to believe so they can rage and hate on the IRS
&gt;&gt;2265173OK makes since. I figured its was stocks, thats the same reason I left it alone.
just fucing lie whats wrong with you? your cashing out $6000 USD just divide that buy whatgever some bitcoin and ether is worth and just say u bought that many somet ime ago. its not like they are going to ask to see ur poloniex history fucking goof
The government is such a fucking mafia, they want a piece of the pie every time money changes hands&gt;Company gets taxed for making money&gt;Customers get taxed for buying their products&gt;Employees get taxed for getting paid&gt;Employees get taxed for spending their pay&gt;Employees get taxed for any activity they do on their own time that made them money&gt;Instead of using that tax money to repair roads, improve schools, give healthcare, and other things that would improve society, they waste it all on stupid shit
&gt;&gt;2265043Some not moron please confirm this, i&#039;m a moron.Making 500 trades and taxing each trade at 15% should equal to making 1 trade at 15% SHOULD be the same, right?
&gt;&gt;2264812&gt;muh boogeymanOh no it&#039;s not like every white country on Earth is rich because they&#039;ve robbed every black and brown country on Earth for the last 200 years please fuck me in the ass and take 20% taxman lel
rule of thumb: just send 20% of everything you make to the gubmint (capital gains tax) and youre probably fine.I had to cut them a check for 75k last year for all my stock trading
&gt;&gt;2264385&gt;not understanding capital gainsCome on dude, that&#039;s beginner shit.
&gt;&gt;2264812fuck off bernie
&gt;&gt;2264988&gt;&gt;2265089Incorrect...each time you sell, it&#039;s a capital gain/loss on that transaction.
&gt;&gt;2265304Look at it another wayBuy $100 of BTCTrade all of it for DGBDGB value goes up to $200Trade back to BTCCash out(ignore fees, etc)If you paid taxes on each trade, you would end up with $100 * 0.9 (BTC -&gt; DGB) * 0.9 (DGB -&gt; BTC) * .9 (BTC -&gt; USD), which means your $100 profit is now only $72.90.Of course, that&#039;s not how it really works, you&#039;re only taxed when you cash out, but if you were taxed per exchange, you could get really fucked.
&gt;&gt;2265366Citation needed, IRS considers it a like-kind exchange last I heard
&gt;&gt;2265201No, you pay for every transaction bought, then sold.&gt;you don&#039;t pay on sales tax once per year based off the total purchases made in a year, you pay sales tax each time. Capital gains is the same way.&gt;Have etrade account, buy x, sell x, buy y, sell y. Both transactions will have capital gains tax that needs to be paid, and it will be a short term, aka higher tax.
&gt;&gt;2265388in the future just pay every transaction in BEANCOIN!!
&gt;&gt;2265374so do we actually have a source on this paying only when we cash out? I&#039;ve gotten pretty convinced that&#039;s not how it is
&gt;&gt;2264312I ain&#039;t even reading through this whole thread, but no.If it ain&#039;t in FIAT the IRS matters not.
&gt;&gt;2265388&gt;you don&#039;t pay on sales tax once per year based off the total purchases made in a year, you pay sales tax each time. Capital gains is the same way.Capital gains are not the same way. Capital gains taxes apply when you turn your assets into fiat. Sales taxes aren&#039;t comparable at all.
&gt;&gt;2265301Trump will make America great again.
&gt;&gt;2265397Do you file yourself on steam trading cards? Do you pay on CS GO skins or rocket league trades?Trading a coin for a coin is not a sale. It&#039;s a trade. And it&#039;s subject to your terms at the time of exchange. If you&#039;re audited you&#039;d be smart to save a copy of your ledgers, but people saying you need to file them are idiots. It&#039;s not money.
&gt;&gt;2265381&gt;citation neededhave you never had a brokerage account before?
&gt;&gt;2264410Every day that passes more and more users are buying bitcoin and making trades. Do you think the irs will have the manpower to audit even a fraction of the users? They will have to audit basecoin then compare that data to poloniex then they will have to find someone knowledgeable enough to manage all of this all the while millions upon millions of users will fill up their todo box. They are years behind the curve and i doubt they will be able to catch up. And this is assuming someone doesnt wash their coins through monero or some other service.
&gt;&gt;226479830% CGT or 15% if you hold for minimum 12 months
&gt;&gt;2264312lol no, just claim you dont know shit and pay the 30% capital gains tax
&gt;&gt;2264812&gt;what is the military industrial complex&gt;what is aid to israel&gt;what is the federal reserve
&gt;&gt;2265420I see what you&#039;re saying.Honestly I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any need to worry about taxes at all until cashing out.Plus, at the point when (if ever) it&#039;s time to cash out, the 0.001% cost of profits will not be a waste to get a professional opinion.
&gt;&gt;2265409You missed the comparison.When you buy and sell stocks, every transaction is line item on a tax form your broker gives you. Each line will show the capital gain/loss on it, and you pay the taxes for each transaction. This is also auto reported to the IRS, so if you don&#039;t claim it on your tax return, they buttfuck you harder than Ja&#039;roam in the slammer.
&gt;&gt;2265452This. I have yes to hear of a case of someone going to jail over crypto tax. So far they ross and thats about it. Also expect a bitcoin party either by next election or by 2024.
&gt;&gt;2265426Every US based exchange will auto report to the IRS.&gt;what do you think the photo id verification is for
&gt;&gt;2265476this. mfw the IRS will begin buttfucking neets for their cryptogainz in a couple years.
&gt;&gt;2265466God i feel so sorry for those of you that live in the U.S.
Idea: Send your BTC/coin through coinbase, polo, bittrex, yobit, c-cex, livecoin, nova, etc, etc, etcThen when eventually one of they shuts down/exit scams the paper trail disappears. No more transaction history.(This is to humor those who think every transaction is taxable) So then you could say you lost a huge portion of your exchange history
&gt;&gt;2265420this is fine as long as you never plan on cashing out.

&gt;&gt;2268472They didn&#039;t want it from me 4 days agoOP is fake news
They didn&#039;t want it from me as early as yesterday.Coin base on the other hand... But it is a major federally insured exchange.

Bitcoin price in, 2027? Just for fun.I want to know the opinion of /Biz-in the Internet, very huge sites and apps had fallen because new shiny ones (MySpace, Napster, ares), that&#039;s my biggest concern about Bitcoin...Also its obvious many coins will life together, there are enough space.
5 dollars
At least 100k of FIAT I guess
1 BTC
Under $100 with only bagholders trying to prop it up.Crypto is young and will still see a lot of change, this will include BTC dying because they basically can&#039;t innovate for fear of breaking the blockchain.
&gt;&gt;2268655&gt;fiat has suffered massive inflation and 100k is literally penniesYou might be right.

Does Siacoin have potential to reach $1 in the next couple of years?Discuss bizbros
do like I did and sell those fucking bags and buy a coin that is mooning like STRATIS, XBY, or DGB.
&gt;&gt;2266643Yeah dude, buy coins that have already mooned and therefore are super high risk instead of a new coin with great potential
&gt;&gt;2266624it&#039;s not DGB so no.
&gt;&gt;2266670this is /biz/. we buy high, sell low.To op&#039;s question. Yeah of course it has potential? But will it? THat&#039;s anybody&#039;s guess otherwise we&#039;d all be millionaires.
&gt;&gt;2266670&gt;he thinks any of these coins have already mooned&gt;&gt;2266624it needs a marketcap of $28.8 billion to hit $1 per coini&#039;m gonna say no

&gt;&gt;2266752Just bought more Sia and my strategy is just to HODL and put high sell orders. Can&#039;t go wrong with that strategy in a volatile market.
&gt;&gt;22666241$ would be like 30b marketcap. That is very unlikely, at least for a year. 0.1$ is more than possible though in my opinion.

to reach the highest score of all my familymoney is just merely a number, and life is a game
being able to buy a house in a nice (but not that nice) area of Londona bit of income from renting rooms, and will mean my day job income is all disposable.ideally work 4 day weeks from 30 years old onwards, retire at 45, live on passive income.
&gt;&gt;2265484death.&gt;it&#039;s your endgame too
&gt;&gt;2265484Move permanently from the United Caliphate of Great Britain to Ausgaylia
&gt;&gt;2266128&gt;to reach the highest score of all my family&gt;tfw first thought is that you have a family of killers and you want to get more kills than them
lambolandAlso, having a considerable side income, apart from my work.Not to mention the excitement. My life was starting to get boring before I started trading cryptos.
&gt;&gt;2265484Pay down my credit card debt! I bought 100 bitbeans and 5 stratis now and will hold for 1 year
Get my own apartmentBuy a carGirlfriendFreelance web devCrypto trading expertLife&#039;s going to be good /biz/
Pay off my debt, pay off parents&#039; debt, pay off siblings debt, pay off three closest friends&#039; debtAfter that, enough to quit my job and be comfortable traveling, making music, and climbing without a second thought of &quot;oh I don&#039;t have enough money&quot;Also, a new truck would be nice
I just want to buy a T-72 tank.http://www.mortarinvestments.eu/products/tanks-2/t-72-42

&gt;Put my gains into a high interest mutual fund that nets me a liveable sum every month.&gt;move to a place where tax is low and sex is cheap&gt;work out, get LASIK and get a hair transplant.&gt;laugh at all the chads and stacies
&gt;&gt;2265696&gt;send my future kids to the top international schools so they&#039;ll grow up with the best life possible.Top international schools will turn your girls into instagram whores who pretend they&#039;re worldy and make beta cucks of your sons.I know this because I was a beta cuck but I snapped out of it.
&gt;&gt;2266233Thailand man. I just got back from living there for 6~ months and if you had about $2-3k income a month you could live like a god
&gt;&gt;2266294Where did you stay in Thailand for 6 months?? Seems to me its the sort of place thats nice for a 2 week vacation but anything more than that the language barrier and resentment the locals would get from all the farangs would grate on me.I&#039;m Canadian, how hard would it be to just pack my bags and live in Thailand forever? I don&#039;t want to harm anyone, I just want some good consensual sex and a place to enjoy my money. No drugs for me either.Maybe Phillipines might be a better option, they speak English there....
&gt;&gt;2265484&quot;short&quot; term, I&#039;ve jumped in mostly curious to see if I can build up enough to finance a trip to Japan. Beyond that, if I can surreptitious sneak out enough to cover my taxes every year I&#039;d be ecstatic, anything beyond that is gravy. I&#039;m really not that big on muh-lambo, honestly.
I want to buy a house. It doesn&#039;t have to be a mansion. I just want to be able to afford a nice home.
&gt;&gt;2265484Not work anymore, and use the time doing what I enjoy the most (creative bad paid jobs). Also, buy some politicians in order to remove unfair laws about the age of consent.
&gt;&gt;2266323I traveled for 6 weeks with gf, then we lived in Chiang mai for some months then Bangkok. Taught English some and just relaxed overall.The resentment thing is def some what true, but very livable, I made the mistake of not trying hard enough to learn the language. If you take the effort to learn it and integrate it seems like a great life as long as not living on shitty english teacher salary alone. Living there forever would be very easy, just get a hot thai wife, which is basically guaranteed and relax. It is alarming how many complete cucks have 8+/10 gfs.I know sooo little thai considering how long I was there and I never had any problems, they know enough english. Thailand is nice because it has everything you want, some of the other neighboring SEA countries lack good stuff like fast internet, stuff like tons of video game shops, and music etc
&gt;&gt;2265484Help my parents retire, buy a shiny mercedes SUV and live a comfy life

Is there a pastebin guide here? I want to get into this crypto meme.
&gt;&gt;2266482pa...the...tic , such small minded drivel, localized allegiance faggot idiot
Buy a house with cryptogains, if more then obviously travel and do whatever the fuck. I&#039;ll be satisfied with a house though.
So I just bought a shit load of DGB it&#039;s crazy how fast thing goes up lmao
&gt;&gt;2268919I just sold my house to buy DGB
&gt;&gt;2268919kek
&gt;&gt;2268919PANICSELL SELL SELL
well done!
I wonder how introduction to CS:GO will affect the price...
FUCK YOU MR ANTIJEW
&gt;&gt;2268919kekIf Dan was to invest in a shitcoin right now it would be DGB
Buy more at dip while you can...They have LoL and CSGO..
&gt;cheap right now&gt;NodeJS meme&gt;good roadmap&gt;active devsWhat&#039;s the catch?
hello?
There&#039;s already stratis which is basically just ethereum with C#i dont doubt anyone would want fucking javacript smart contracts, even /g/ thinks javascript is baby language
Being NodeJS doesn&#039;t have any advantage...
&gt;&gt;2268732easier adoption than .NET
&gt;&gt;2268726g is thinking about the old js2017 js is pretty fucking rad
&gt;&gt;2269007&gt;2017 js is pretty fucking radno, it&#039;s not. it has some cool ideas (always has), but it&#039;s still just such a fucking mess.maybe the only good thing about javascript is that it&#039;s taught the programming world how to use closures.
Which one would be a better idea to buy now?I know Start is like ethereum 2.0 but the market cap seems a bit high.So which one? DCR or STRAT?
Neither. Buy Sia instead.
Strat
&gt;&gt;2268148how many bitcoins do wanklevi own?
The answer is you should be buying ubiq
&gt;Mooncoin is actually fucking mooningWell I&#039;ll be fucking damned.If anyone ever needed motivation to &quot;buy and hold,&quot; this is it.
Also fucking Bleutrade&gt;try to log in&gt;have to wait 10 minutes to get confirmation code just to log inWhat garbage, my god.
&gt;&gt;2264380just placed a sell order @0.000999if it ever hits i&#039;m banking 3.8million @current btc price.
&gt;&gt;2265167Good lad.
&gt;went from 1 sat to 3 satis this considered mooning now?thats like finding a penny on the side of the road yesterday, and today you find 2 pennies. does it make sense to start yelling to all your friends &quot;HOLY SHIT I DOUBLED MY WEALTH IN 24 HOURS!!:no you just look like a tard who doesnt understand money
it only went up 1sat, wtf are you talking about mooning, i checked and thought i&#039;d see like 12 sat
I actually FINALLY dumped my bags at 3sat..... wow, what a nightmare . Made a few hundred though.
&gt;&gt;2265196If you put $1000 in Mooncoin at 1 sat, You now have $3000 worth.It&#039;s that easy.
lmao, look at some of those sell orders...&gt;selling 8 million moon coins for .5 BTC each
Who the fuck spent 30k on moon coins?? Who are these people?
&gt;&gt;2266121rich bored guys or absolute madmen
No brakes for Mooncoin, 3 sat sell wall coming down quickly
mother fuckers still getting pumpedits over for no-mooncoiners
&gt;&gt;2264380We are going to the moon boys, buy in at 3 sats while you still can.
Lets gooo 10 sats here we come
People thought we were meming when we said this would be the next dgb/rdd...
Congrats on finally finding someone to hold your 2 sat bags!
WHEN WILL THIS BE ON BITTREXI AM NOT SENDING OVER MONEY TO AN EXCHANGE WITH A TYPO IN THE NAME
&gt;&gt;2267849u wot mate? Bleutrade doesn&#039;t have a typo
&gt;&gt;2264380Lol no way fag. Bitcoin is still above 2000$ and there&#039;s a bunch of shady shit going on with all the exchanges right now. Besides atm I really can&#039;t concentrate.
14000 mooncoin. Fucking no coiners kekek.Dun finna moon soon
Anybody that thinks mooncoin is going anywhere is insane. You anons are literally just handing each other your bags. Instead of better discussion, there&#039;s always a few shitty, desperate mooncoin shill threads. If a good coin had this much attention this often, it would be mooning hard (DGB).Mooncoin buyers: Have fun wishing for 2x gains when the rest of us are going to actually make money.
So, when is it actually being added to ccex?
&gt;bought at 4 satsplease moon
MOON MISSION IMMINENTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2268538Huh? How? Why? It&#039;s been at either 2 or 3 for the past days. How could you possibly have bought at 4?
reminder that the supply of this coin is so insanely high that if it ticks up even a few sats shoots it right up to one of the highest market caps out there
&gt;&gt;2268818(excuse the shoddy sentence structure, you get the idea)
&gt;&gt;2268818It&#039;s smaller if you consider the frozen accounts, the big ones on explorer.
&gt;&gt;2268837&gt;frozen accountsTrue. Do remember that a lot of coins have been lost, especially early adopters.t. I had a few thousand a while back, as in, before Mt Gox, don&#039;t remember where the fuck I had them.
&gt;&gt;2268796how new are you?It peaked at 5sat briefly during intiital pump&gt;3sat sell wall is growinglooooool
&gt;&gt;2268362lol I mean come on. I dumped my moon at 3 sats in the intial pump, but to come into this thread and actually start shilling DGB is just pathetic. Everyone this is what it looks like when a noob has vested in one type of shitcoin, and thinks other shitcoins can&#039;t moon
weaponized....autism....autistic baghodlers are a scary thing
Best shitcoin to buy?
&gt;shitcoinsBuy XRP, GNT and ETH.t. definitely not a bagholder
&gt;&gt;2268945&gt;xrp and ethpick one anon, they don&#039;t move together
What coins do I buy to hold for a year or more? Besides BTC and ETH.
GNTICN
DGB, are you blind or something?
BTCXMRETHXRPGNTDGB
RDD; hold until at least Reddit launches, then you can use RDD on any social site to micro-tip in addition to likes and shares. Including cam sites.
*ReddID
XMRPIVXRDDDGBXBY
Just lmao if your aren&#039;t accumulating UBIQ right nao
&gt;&gt;2268899Bump with an addition.I&#039;m a poorfag so stuff like XMR which are stable and basically just stores of value right now are not worthy holds right now. I need 1-2 years of hold with 100x or more gains.
LTCmost undervalued non-shitcoin
We just passed the 90 billion marketcap for the 3rd time this month.Lets see if it holds now!
hearing rumours of 1 trillion next week
24h volume is surprisingly lowI remember 10 days ago when it was like 5 billions
&gt;&gt;2268880Is that a good thing?
&gt;&gt;2268969a rise on high volume would be better than a rise on low volume imo
&gt;&gt;2268969it means the whales are lowkey dumping everything they have
Whatever happened to Milocoin?
no potential for a coin named after a pedophile
Seriously the technology ideas are great, but the fuck do name or associate it with Milo in any way?I guess the best that can happen to this coin is that it would pump and dump, but with the 0.05 daily volume I don&#039;t see it happening.
&gt;wake up&gt;check exchange&gt;all shitcoins I was interested in mooned and I missed it&gt;tfw sleep cucks you out of gainsHow do I solve the sleep problem? Surely there must be a way to stay focused without needing to sleep in current year?
get on the ubermensch sleep schedule, that way you&#039;ll only miss 20 minutes of mooning at a time
what is an alarm?what is Bitcoin Checker?You fags really like to activate my almond sometimes...
&gt; mooned&gt; 20-50% increasesyou people are retarded. Mooning is...TO GO FURTHER BEYOND.&gt; t. stratis going up 11,000% LOLjust wait and buy the dip you stupid faggot. These gains are peanuts compared to what the potential is long term
cocaineyou&#039;re ready to play like big boys at wall-street
would it benefit /biz/ if we pooled all of our knowledge with an eternal general on the board?
Someone explain to me what and why is happening with all the exchanges right now. Seems like noone can get verified and a lot of problems are happening with transactions.
No it would benefit the dipshits who came here because of the election and other news. Let them sift through the memes for nuggets of truth. We earn our scars, they are the price of knowledge.
&gt;&gt;2267871Seconded
Buuump
Yes or someone should just write a short guide, tips and trick, etc. and make a proper sticky for this boardThat way we won&#039;t have those 50 newcomer threads every day
&gt;&gt;2267871ThisHaving things all on plate won&#039;t really help much people anyway, you got sticky post at /fit/ which basically covers all information, yet people still can&#039;t read it or understand
&gt;&gt;2268410&gt;ThisNo one reads a sticky
is there an irc channel where cryptonerds congregate?
Rather why not try to spread the word on other boards for a cheap pump and dump using rookies from like /v/ or some shit?
No more spoon feeding faggots .01 btc for advice only I&#039;m a crypto millionaire btw
How good is Factom? Why do plebbit traders say it&#039;s undervalued?
&gt;&gt;2267871yep fuck other peopleno sarcasm
&gt;&gt;2267837this whole board is a cryptocurrency general
&gt;&gt;2268717already being done on /r9k/
&gt;&gt;2268817with what coin
&gt;&gt;2268829all of them
&gt;&gt;2267871This FUCK YOU NEW COINERS!!
&gt;&gt;2268717Think bigger dude, let&#039;s spread this shit thorugh meme magic to reddit like it was done with r_TheDonald
HOW THE FUCK DO I GET SOME MAJOR MONEY IN BTC WITHOUT WAITING A WEEK FOR THIS PIECE OF SHIT TO VERIFY MY BANK ACCOUNT?LITERALLY EVERY DAY EVERY SHITCOIN IS GOING UP 50% I CAN&#039;T WAIT A FUCKING WEEKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
localbitcoins
&gt;&gt;2268952You would use a service like Coinjar to buy BTC; then use shapeshift.io to convert into smaller currencies. That is how you&#039;d do it without an exchange.
&gt;&gt;2268952Be grateful....you&#039;ll have an opportunity to buy the dip soon. I already sold everything yesterday
So.. I&#039;m quite heavy into Zcash.I could sell at a 10% loss... or hold in hope of rerise... I believed in the anononimity concept but Im reading mixed opinions. What are your thoughts?Basically a HALP N WUTDO /BIZ/ PL0X
&gt;&gt;2268868hold
&gt;&gt;2268882Could you provide some arguments?
&gt;&gt;2268868they are mining millions of coins a year for the next few years...
I&#039;m pretty high on narcotics but can&#039;t stop trading or thinking about it. help
Poorfag here. In order to diversify from BTC, I bought LTC and XMR a couple of months back but they are probably the most stable alts which is why the peanuts of LTC or XMR won&#039;t get me anywhere anyway.There is a chance that BTC with its name recognition can make x100 10 years down the road but these two could never do that. They seem to be like bonds for people with high portfoilo at this point.I&#039;m looking for long term hodl coins (at least 2 years) that would bring 100x. Do me a favour and don&#039;t shill your shitcoins here.
ETH, XPR
&gt;&gt;2268814I have some XRP but I just bought it because it was dipping hard. I&#039;d probably sell once it reaches to 20s. The fact that there are a hundred billion of these coins just pushes me away. And ETH is probably just too late for me to join now.
Just gonna bump this.
it HAS to dip sometime soon, right? RIGHT?
&gt;&gt;2268740if it doesn&#039;t the coin is kinda fuckedunless for some reason people are really that interested in minecraft mining
the second unofficial name which is only known to real /biz/ness men is: NerverDipCoin NDC
&gt;&gt;2268746&gt;he thinks the coin stops at minecraftwhat a daft cunt you are
&gt;&gt;2268781I posted that minecraft idea on /biz/ 2 weeks ago. Where&#039;s my million DGB?
&gt;&gt;2268781Sorry, you want me to list every game? Did it trigger you that I didn&#039;t? the sentiment was pretty clear, moron
&gt;&gt;2268849&gt;the coins applications stop at video gamesya you&#039;re a daft cunt m8
&gt;&gt;2268891yup cuz that isn&#039;t the main selling point or anythingfuck off to your digihole you faggotwhat kind of name is digibyte anyway, sounds gay as fuck
Which crypto has the best tech regardless of popularity and why?
Does stratis have even a whitepaper? What is this hype all about?
&gt;&gt;2267574yes, and i am currently reading it
From what i&#039;ve been told its just another memereum clone but just another programing language...
&gt;&gt;2267612don&#039;t underestimate the power of using another language.
&gt;&gt;2267640But ETH got all the jews already on board.
&gt;&gt;2268274I don&#039;t think people want to invest in jews &amp; banks exactly, It kinda ruins the freedom of blockchain
&gt;&gt;2267585perfect meme name STRATIS. That and it&#039;s a literal business that&#039;s making money behind it. also i think their customers are using their chain too, which means more moneys, so its pretty sweet.
Why wouldnt vitalik do ethereum in C if it was better? Do not forget that he is a genious, whereas the other guy is a nobody (at least for now)
&gt;&gt;2268288&gt;freedom of blockchainLmfao Stratis is based on C#/.NET and you&#039;re talking about freedom?
GET ON THE GOLOS GOLD HYPE TRAIN
Fucking golos, at least provide a brief shill for fucks sake
this is such a failed pump it&#039;s sickening.
Let&#039;s face facts, the world is changing.FODL is the futureFact 1) Up 60% today aloneFact 2) Don&#039;t get left behindFact 3) Passed the &quot;shitcoin range&quot;(0-150 satoshis) a long time ago and is well beyondFact 4) FODL is one letter away from HODLFact 5) Don&#039;t be a FUD, it&#039;s time to be rich.
&gt;&gt;2268862Fact 6) Listed on Poloniex and not some shitty sexchange like Nova or Bleu.
Already pumped retard.
&gt;&gt;2268876i posted about it several days ago when it hit 540 and dropped down to 440 for a while; it&#039;s not done you faggot
&gt;&gt;2268862It&#039;s FLDC you fucking mongOn bittrex anyway

&gt;&gt;2268352buy high sell low goy
Buy STR on Poloniex or its called XLM on Kraken
Put 2.5k in DGB and the rest in bitcoin. China will collapse soon the us economy wont be that far behind so get the fuck out of fiat money
Bump. I&#039;m also new. I just saved 1k and opened a brokerage account. How do I turn it into 10k?
&gt;&gt;2268381Put some pocket change in these and they&#039;re the only coins that got me decent profit. Sold partially during peak, now i&#039;m gonna wait for a dip and go in big.
I know my digibros are probably comfy and resting after a long 48 hours of steady digigains but take a look at NAV right now. Shes ready to blow. 52 btc buy order going through as i type this. Get in on the pump.

&gt;&gt;2268584because it will make a lot of money for you, high potential for growth, faster than most coinsez
&gt;&gt;2268584tfw watching some time ago this channelthanks for remind :)
new here, share your experiences with crypto-currency plsare all of the crypto-currencies just one big meme?do the people in charge buy one crypto currency then hype it up, then sell before it crashes?isn&#039;t cryptocurrency trading a 0 sum game?
&gt;&gt;2268671its zero sum, but money keeps coming in right now, the only ones losing are boomers in 10 years.for pump in dumps its those who buy at the top who lose, of course /biz/ is usually clever enough to not buy near the top.The only big wave of losses i can imagine is people who buy DGB right now
It&#039;s a pyramid scheme. You need a constant stream of suckers to get your money out, now think about why 90% of biz now are crypto threads. Makes sense doesn&#039;t it? They&#039;re just people who bought into a scam and are desperate to cash out. Don&#039;t fall for it, they&#039;re literally worthless. Only Bitcoin has any value at all and that is purely to buy drugs over the internet.
&gt;&gt;2268787not coping too well i see
&gt;&gt;2268787This. The only others that MIGHT have value long term are ETH, XRP, and XMR.
&gt;&gt;2268800I&#039;d tell you to kill yourself but coinfags already do that when they realize they&#039;ve been scammed
&gt;&gt;2268787This only describes 95% of all the coins (including Bitcoin) though. Ones like ETH will probably have a long-term future.
&gt;&gt;2268671biggest experience is believe in myselfI don&#039;t know if this can apply to every shit gobbler here, but if I think a coin is going to go up, even if it temporarily goes down, it probably will go up.dips and rises are meant to fuck with people and make the whales as much profit along the way
Don&#039;t miss out Lads, time to cuck /sp/wagerr.com/ico
&gt;&gt;2268833got 5k wgr myselfdo you think the betting thing will take off, or will it just turn into another slow pump followed by a sudden dump?
The king is back

WERE GOING BACK UP BABY
&gt;&gt;2268047ok, its too late xD
Smart money is selling DGB and buying XBY then after XBY moons, transferring back to DGB
A correction then, hopefully it&#039;ll stabilise in the 1800/1900s if not higher.
lol the whales know they can&#039;t keep suppressing the price for much longer, if they sell and it dips people will buy it instantly now.We moon boys
&gt;&gt;2268063why would the whales suppress the price
&gt;&gt;2268080Accumulation?
I&#039;M BACK IN THE GAMEDGB IS REFUELED AND READY FOR SATURN

&gt;&gt;2268499bought at ~800, sold at 1850Seems good, but still small profit (cause volume is very small)What the next ?(By the way, i&#039;m still holding the MOON bought at 1sat when it was firstly mentioned here - it had hit 4 sat earlier but i have not sold it)
These digis never cease to amaze me
OH NO ITS DIPPING!!! IT&#039;S OVER!!!! LOL. NEVER INVEST WHAT YOU ARE AFRAID YOU&#039;LL LOSE PEOPLE!!
Sold my DGB and bought SC instead. No ragrets.
&gt;it&#039;s not a P&amp;Dfucking K E K
&gt;&gt;2268686What kind of whale can pump the most traded coin on the market? None.
&gt;&gt;2268724Bill gates could lol
&gt;&gt;2268745Hello Nigger
&gt;&gt;2268724&gt;most traded coinAnd how do you think it&#039;s the most traded coin, idiot. Trading bots. I cannot believe how stupid you digifaggots are sometimes.
&gt;&gt;2268061Fuck off. You&#039;re not smart money.
Sup /biz/Are you reading any /biz/ literature? Are you sharing the knowledge that you achieved in both the book, your experience and your families experience with the 4chan community?You know, we make more money that way! ;)&gt;Here in my garage.
&gt;&gt;2268228Currently reading Art of the Deal. Bretty gud.
&gt;&gt;2268258Any highlights Senpai? Dr Phil is his book &quot;Life Code&quot; Recommended by Tai Lopez had a chapter written on negotiation. I was looking for it just now, couldn&#039;t find it.Sometimes on my days off I&#039;ll take a bit adderoll and whip out a book.... Not often, just occasionally. Don&#039;t want to become addicted!
&gt;bought 4.3 BTC of DGB at 1980 SATt-this better work out long term
Bye bye gains 100 sats next Sunday.
&gt;&gt;2268444dude what the fuck. I fully belieb in DGB going up at whatever range, but this is dumb if you don&#039;t have like 20 extra btc after this.
&gt;&gt;2268444Don&#039;t worry, seriously...
Should&#039;ve bought sia instead.Don&#039;t worry, there&#039;s still time before we rocket off like DGB.
Don&#039;t sell low like a chump even if it means having to wait for a week. You bought at an ATH
&gt;&gt;2268444You better sell now or you will lose even more
don&#039;t sell. Shark are waiting for you to sell.They sold it to you at 1980 and hope to buy it from you at 1700. Don&#039;t get fucked unless you like it.
Idiots here are too dumb to realize that dgb has a big ass presentation infront of big ass companies. This alone makes it currently the most interesting coin out there. Whether its a memecoin or not, doesnt matter. They have a huge chance to go bigJust hold lad. Youll be glad you did
&gt;&gt;2268444&gt;&gt;2268444Don&#039;t get tricked into &quot;cutting your losses&quot; by selling low. I fucked up with XRP like that. It&#039;ll be around 2-3k around CITI event.
&gt;&gt;2268512sauce on the presentation?
&gt;&gt;2268503nosomeone who bought at 200 sold it to him at 2000 because they know that whales are dumping it all now.Now that they dumped it all, they will move to another coin, but a few anons will keep buying and keeping the price up for a little bit, but in the end it will go back down without the whales pushing.
&gt;&gt;2268444Thanks for buying my bags.
&gt;&gt;2268444Don&#039;t worry man. It&#039;ll dip a tiny bit, but merely being finalists for the Citibank contest has garnered a lot of attention and momentum for the coin. It&#039;ll be up be next Thursday, chill. If anything, be HAPPY you just put bitcoin down on Digi about a week before their presentation.
&gt;&gt;2268444dude you&#039;re gonna have some rough hands after all thisdont let the FUDers break you
&gt;&gt;2268444&gt;tfw finally understanding how the whales work
&gt;&gt;2268444&gt;buying @ ath&gt;not waiting for the dipconsidered kys?but well, damage is done.only way to prevent further damage now is HODL strong! Iron Hands!i guess dgb will dip during the next days and go up again even more, since on 09.06. is some major event for this coin.
&gt;&gt;2268567aware me on what FUD stands for please.&gt;&gt;2268543We need to start seriously discussing wtf we are doing come June 9th. Is that the day we sell out and see where the market goes? Or do we HODL and expect somehow it&#039;ll go up when it doesn&#039;t win?Because let&#039;s be real, no fucking bank is giving a prize to a crypto that destroys their entire business model.
&gt;&gt;2268586buy the rumous sell the news
oh shit you fucked up OP.DGB is actually dipping at the moment and the Citibank conference on June 9th will only mention DGB as a footnote mention.As for minecraft, they are only using DGB on one Minecraft server, not the entire game. So really less than 1% of Minecraft players will even know what DGB is.
&gt;&gt;2268602VOX 2.0
&gt;&gt;2268578How much btc gain you got out of that? I have been thinking about doing that, but one wrong timing and you are out losing all you gained.Besides folks, it&#039;s not a big deal, I have 40 more BTC. I just calculated this raise wrong.
XRP dipping and ready to launch. Don&#039;t say /biz/ didn&#039;t warn you.
&gt;stallman postingmy nigga
confirmed. it has a textbook weezer logo signaling the entry point.
&gt;&gt;2267021Looking to enter at 11500, entry is vital because I use x10 leverage, most of the time if you hit the sweet spot you make a lot of money. I longed XRP from 12k to 20k with x10 before and netted just over 20 btc, it all just comes down to finding the perfect bottom.Regarding the short term I see a potential cup and handle formation yet to play out, don&#039;t see any large spikes right now but defiantly looking to see this drop a few more satoshi.
&gt;&gt;2267098&gt;Looking to enter at 11500That&#039;s the mark.
&gt;&gt;2267098see you at 11500 bra, lets make some cash
Some insight if you&#039;re interested, followed this guy on Twitter, guy barely has any followers but he&#039;s gold.
This might be it my friends.
&gt;&gt;2267150whats his handle?
&gt;&gt;2267150Agreed. He always has the best timing too.
Pretty confident 11.5 will hold nicely, get those longs ready boys.
&gt;&gt;2267150&gt;could be looking at ATHZoom out. It will break through the $0.5 barrier like tissue paper.
bail or not?
&gt;&gt;2267150&gt;This guy&gt;Doesn&#039;t give nameIs there something in this pic that I am not seeing it?
&gt;&gt;2267150whats his name?
&gt;&gt;2267243&gt;&gt;2267248@wolfofbitmex
this is it, go
long or short at this point? what do you guys think?
&gt;&gt;2267311I only short from a ath, I have no balls to short the chance of support breaking on a bottom.
I&#039;m in at 11420. It&#039;s time for launch.
&gt;&gt;2267344What exchange you on? Bitmex is holding up at 11719 right now,
&gt;&gt;2267344in at same price on polo
&gt;&gt;226735611479 on Bittrex rn. Already dropped to 11400. It&#039;s looking sketch but I&#039;m hopeful.
&gt;&gt;2267356I grabbed it at the very last Bittrex bottom. It dipped and I decided it was time to jump in.
&gt;trading with marginfuck this is stressful
&lt;11400 now. Not looking great.
&gt;&gt;2267377Same here bro, going long x10 as soon as i can get the right entry, upside on XRP is huge so the gains that are possible are mindboggling.What was your entry?Patience. Patience. Patience. never let your emotion overrule your logic.
&gt;&gt;226739711420 on polo.Looks like its been dropping for 6 hours.
&gt;&gt;226739711000 might be where this goes. Hopefully no lower.
&gt;&gt;2267377&gt;&gt;2267397gonna drink some whisky to calm my heart rate at this point.
what caused the dying off from that peak a few days ago? and why is it still dying
its fighting back
&gt;&gt;2267428My honest guess is DGB going parabolic.
&gt;tfw bought ripple 9 months ago at 1ksats but sold for a measly 30% gains
Hold on, boys. It&#039;s a bumpy ride.
tfw in @ 11875 averageevery single time I go long it crashes down harder and when I go short it explodes from a peak like I&#039;ve never seen before
and again, fighting back
I have no fucking clue at this point guys.
&gt;&gt;2267534hold on, we&#039;re almost out of this thing
&gt;&gt;2267534You should of waited to see if it broke support or not, even if it didn&#039;t and bounced off you&#039;d have more confirmation of a long going in your favor.
There is a lot of sell pressure. Still hopeful
&gt;BIDS 287.875 BTC&gt;ASKS 748529.332 BTCHOW
This might play out for a while guys, let DGB have the spotlight for now, soon it will be XRP&#039;s turn to wreck havoc.
needs to just double already so i can let go of this tacky corporate bag
&gt;&gt;2267557Yeah, I should be more patient, zoom out more, and mitigate my risks
Well guys. Maybe we&#039;re out of the woods. Too soon to tell. A guy who has been very successful at this (literally made a mil) told me that all of these signs were bogus and that June 5 is the day XRP goes up for the new ath. He won&#039;t tell me why but maybe I should just listen to him.
that was fucking stressful, time for some profitim not 100% sold on margin trading yet guys, even at only 2.5x leverage
&gt;&gt;2267065That&#039;s winger, not weezer. Slightly different.
when are we selling marginbros?
&gt;&gt;2267168Who is he?
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!
We have lifdoff
in at 11420, out at 11705, ggwp fellas
&gt;&gt;2267021ripple is really tedious, I don&#039;t really see the future in this coin. I&#039;m only holding 1k so when the banks pump in in the future I got that nice $$ profit
&gt;&gt;2267265&gt;&gt;2267150&gt;&gt;2267168@wolfofbitmex doesnt exist anymore... hmmm
really buy this?i have 0.5 btc, i&#039;d like a nice boost on an insured moon
&gt;&gt;2268210Buy dgb then.Itll only go up this week. Idiots are too dumb to understand that having a presentation infront of huge fucking companies will boost the coin to another galaxy. Memecoin or not.I never felt this good holding something
&gt;&gt;2268237that&#039;s the news, that&#039;s when you&#039;re supposed to sellvox did the exact same thing, unbeatable, reaching new highsthen the conference happened, and it crashed forever
&gt;&gt;2268240Same with LTC after Segwit desut. bagholder who bought the news
&gt;&gt;2267098&gt;&gt;2267150&gt;&gt;2267177&gt;&gt;2267265&gt;&gt;2267341&gt;&gt;2267356&gt;&gt;2267397&gt;&gt;2267557&gt;&gt;2267581gigashill detected, @wolfofbitmex doesnt exist anymore
&gt;&gt;2268302https://twitter.com/WolfOfCryptosit&#039;s this guy i think?
&gt;&gt;2268311so u just gave the wrong name then
&gt;&gt;2268321maybe he changed it
&gt;&gt;2267150that line is all the bagholders stuck with XRP
you got shilled by a shill account... check the charts
&gt;&gt;2268108Has changed handle to @wolfofcrypto
&gt;&gt;2268302&gt;&gt;2268311&gt;&gt;2268321&gt;&gt;2268328it was there before, display name was &#039;Black Skinhead&#039;
&gt;&gt;2268397lmao, what a fucking gypsy shill.i still made money tho
How would a potential Bitcoin split work? Do you get double the coins? Do you need to choose one? What happens if your coins are in a exchange while it happens?Can anyone that was around during the ETH split chime in with how that went, please?.
&gt;&gt;2266558Good question ... I d-don&#039;t know
Look at what happened to ETH. One fork will become dominant while the other hangs out. The split in value will depend on how unified the community is in choosing a successor fork.When ETH split, generally exchanges provided users with a balance of both coins that emerged, but that takes time as the exchanges themselves have to do the back end work to set that up.
&gt;&gt;2266558Yes you would get coins on both chains. If the exchange has your coins they don&#039;t necessarily owe you the new coins, but like with ETH-ETC, they probably will give them to you. I had ETH on Polo at the time. I got ETC 1:1 for every ETH but NOT ETH THAT WAS LENT OUT.The coins won&#039;t both have the same USD value as before, they would settle at some point where the combined market caps would equal the pre-split caps, and then move from there.
&gt;&gt;2268081You must get the fuck out of every exchange that isn&#039;t listing both legacy and BIP148 coins by august 1st or you are risking to lose all of your money if BIP148 wins.Remember that legacy (jihadcoin) doesn&#039;t have segwit, and the chain will be dead if BIP148 gets 51% hashrate. Meanwhile BIP148 has sewit and is safe from reorganization (aka it can never be killed)Just dump jihaincoins for segwitcoins.
&gt;&gt;2267890ETH-ETC was a hardfork because vitalik buterin acted like a central bankerThis is a softfork. If BIP148 wins, the legacy chain DIES and then there&#039;s only 1 coin again.This is why the more support BIP148 gets the more dangerous it is to stay on legacy coin. It&#039;s a snowball effect.Everyone left on legacy chain is under the mercy of Jihan Wu and his ASICBOOST exploit + no segwit.We NEED to kill that chinese autist, so support UASF.
Long term hodls aside,Does TA work for predicting moon missions in the short term (&lt;24h), or knowing when to dump?I&#039;ve been trying stochastics, macd, meme triangles, moving averages, parabolic sar... and they only seem useful in hindsight.Trying to analyze order books hasn&#039;t been very reliable either.Now I&#039;m holding bags of shit with both hands and barely keeping up with BTC.Spoon feed a poor fag a little pls.

Cool I just dropped 500 on it when it was 100 sats because I was bored.... Jesus no matter what I&#039;m fine if it crashes or moons. 10k. Thank you Lord.
&gt;&gt;2268631How do you move $10k into USD in a day?
&gt;&gt;2268609How much memecoins do you have?
&gt;he sells it all, causes a massive dump&gt;people all buy the dump and its back on top 30 mins laterPls do that. I need more for lambos.
&gt;&gt;2268609Time = moneypress it now fggt
&gt;&gt;2268647Thanks for the idea anon
&gt;&gt;2268609Yes I&#039;m sure you but around $100,000 into some random shitcoin on the offchance it would fly up about 3 years from now.
&gt;&gt;2268636Why would you want to? Just hold it in btc wallet or use a BitPay card. Cashing out isn&#039;t worth the hassle.
this is the best game of my life
&gt;&gt;2268589It&#039;s a good feel indeed
Is this normal?
&gt;&gt;2267037No, but on DGB, it is.
I have that strange feeling today also...
&gt;&gt;2267061&gt;No SimFucking why?
Senpai.. How Am I doing? Started with 0.014 btc
&gt;&gt;2267099On an operational tour with the army. Not allowed SIM cards in where we are, supposed to be using a VPN also, but meh.
&gt;&gt;2267109When? You sir are inspiring.
&gt;&gt;2267165Bought my first 20cad worth in eth back in October and used some of my gains to buy ripple and via in March. In May I converted some of my ripple and all of my via into DGB back when it was 111sats. Had I known DGB would&#039;ve increased THIS much I would&#039;ve bought way more and touched 1btc. It&#039;s hard not to make mistakes once and a while but you get used to being patient.
No. Watch whatever position is exploding very carefully, look out for short squeezes and other such scams related to whatever instrument you are using.
&gt;&gt;2267037&gt;tfw have to recharge phone like five times a day despite having a flagship battery saver because I cant put my phone down as I have to keep checking dem gainzThis is how instasluts must feel like but with likes instead
Fucking MOVE!!! piece of shit coin
&gt;&gt;2268018ive grown to hate this coin. trading half my stash for ark right now
&gt;&gt;2268018&gt;tfw RLC is mooning but GNT has barely movedthis is the work of the (((bankers))) I&#039;m sure
&gt;&gt;2268303I just did the same. Stayed in GNT with a bit, but mostly went to Ark with it as well.
&gt;&gt;2268018That picture is my absolute favorite out of all the ones I&#039;ve seen on 4chan. It&#039;s been years and years since I first saw it, but every time it pops up I giggle uncontrollably. That is all.
So hot right now
&gt;&gt;2267075Yeah, no. Try DGB.
&gt;&gt;2267075&gt;&gt;2267567I hate it when they raise together, it never gives me a chance to 10x10=100x my gains.I always have to pick one slutcoin and stick with her. Juggling with them is almost impossible.
&gt;&gt;2267075&gt;&gt;2267567Wrong. SC is the one to watch for.
Wait for a few days my friend, this post will be so underrated.
&gt;&gt;2268668Yeah, it&#039;s going to rocket to the stars
Are you even running a full node of the coin(s) you&#039;re holding? How do you expect the platform to succeed if you&#039;re just shamelessly profiting off the computing power of others?You do realize if nobody runs nodes your coins are useless.&gt;But anon DGB is gonna hit 1$! No 10!Not if you&#039;re not running a node and/or mining blocks.

&gt;&gt;2268696?
Hi /biz/ I was wondering if there was a coin that wasn&#039;t cisnormative and ideally serves social justice principles, veganism, and 3rd-wave radfem values.I am usually against capitalism, but you can&#039;t deny that altcoins are taking off like a rocket.Any suggestions for a VirtueCoin or something like that? Instead of &quot;mining&quot; which is a highly problematic word, perhaps you can back the currency by virtues? Proof of Woke instead of Proof of Work?
BAIT
1/10 for making me reply
&gt;&gt;2267876yes, I read the Rogan thread too. Now go back to /pol/.
Those people dont have enough money to make their own economy.
&gt;&gt;2267876my god i would LOVE a coin like this to exist because it would be the absolute perfect way to make these stupid fucks poor as all hell as i take everything they have. Dipshits like this would definitely have no idea how to trade and would make for the easiest prey out there
This could be exploitable. I&#039;m unsure of how feasible it would be to make. You would need to have users select various identity options when making a wallet. A black trans muslim would have the highest value and straight white male the lowest. Low oppression value users would pay a fee everytime they do a transfer say 10%, while the black trans muslim would be refunded 80% of payment xe makes.The question is, can the network be programmed to handle redistributing money to the &quot;oppressed&quot; users? If so are SJW dumb enough for it to work without any enforcement mechanisms? If not what could be done to scare at least a portion to follow the rules? Only allow 1 send and receive address per wallet? Could a persons name, identity claims and small profile photo be attached to the wallet and stored in the block chain? Normies will usually fill in any requested details truthfully. If their name and picture is associated with a wallet they are less likely to use a fake identity or gender.
Anons all of these people are already poor and on top of that many of them are suffering from a variety of mental illnesses. Don&#039;t let your greed make you weak faggots, you are already going to have to live with being rich from doing nothing, don&#039;t make it any harder for yourselves.
Bean is the one punch man of cryptocurrencies.
&gt;&gt;2268443I honestly think it can beat litecoin as bitcoins 2nd.It&#039;s fast, you can make tons sprouting, and their coming out with point of sale machines.I could see japs getting into this, they like beansprouts and also the one punch bean angle.
ill presume that means its seasonal trash and the best way around it is to pump and dump, right?
&gt;&gt;2268551This looks like a cool mini atm, could totally see these popping all over asian markets. Japan is now having shops accept tons of altcoins.And if it passes us regulation why not have these cool atms in convenience stores? It would be better than waiting 7+days from coinbase to get in if you were starting.It can work.

&gt;&gt;2267490KYS FUD
or you could just buy the dip and stop having to hate yourself, whatever works for you
&gt;&gt;2267490This coin will be at 5k usd by the end of the week

&gt;&gt;2267527Don&#039;t lie. There is no such thing. There&#039;s shilling and then there&#039;s lying. Don&#039;t be that guy.
&gt;&gt;2267541I&#039;m not lying do you even own DGB?
Just woke up but I may still be dreaming. Do I really see DGB at 1850? Wew...
&gt;&gt;2267490Everyone following /biz/ for more than 3 days knows that DGB fudding is useless.Get over it.You sold after the first little pump, stupid little pajeet that you are.
not looking good
&gt;&gt;2267568I made my profits, but I&#039;m keeping it real. This is non sense, there are no fundamentals. I am saving my money for Sonm (And Sia right now)
&gt;&gt;2267594Yeah I sold enjoy my bags fags hahaha can&#039;t believe you guys bought my bill gates bullshit.
&gt;&gt;2267594Dont worry about these pussy drops, by next week we&#039;ll be onto greater heights
&gt;&gt;2267608Oh shit you think so? Bought back in just incase.
&gt;&gt;2267594
&gt;&gt;2267605moron for lying, moron for selling. this coin will leave you in the dust.
&gt;&gt;2267657Never sold this coin is the future everyone knows it. I have it speculated at around 10k sats by the end of the month bill gates endorsement secures this.
&gt;&gt;2267673
&gt;wake up&gt;see I&#039;ve made $2.3k on an initial $1kIt feels good
&gt;&gt;2267648&gt;&gt;2267684FUCK, is the dump coming?

sold again cya suckers lol how gullible are you idiots?
&gt;&gt;2267527&gt;&gt;2267673I&#039;ve heard that Steve Jobs will endorse DigiByte, it this true? If it is... HOLLY SHIT I HAVE TO BUY!
Le Minecraft server maymaycoin. It&#039;s truly remarkable what qualifies as a pump and dump.
&gt;&gt;2267762Everyone coming up with the &quot;le minecraft&quot; shit shows that he has not invested 1 minute waht DGB actually can and is there for.Ssssssshut the fuck up with Minecraft.
&gt;&gt;2267805lol what is this other than a bitcoin clone with additional methods of pow?
&gt;&gt;2267508pls stop shilling; there are new coiners who get hurt by all the hyperbole. In all seriousness though, DGB/ETH parity by the end of the week.
&gt;&gt;2267805Enlighten us, we&#039;re listening.&gt;&gt;2267827This 1000 times
&gt;&gt;2267603Obvious fud tactics&gt;I bought and made profits but it&#039;s shitNewb thinks &quot;even its supporters don&#039;t believe in it&quot;.

&gt;&gt;2267979Lol she wont be going that low.
Who else here absolutely HYPED for Donald Trump&#039;s DGB presentation?
&gt;&gt;2267490s
DGB phases:&gt;moon&gt;drop to new support&gt;accumulation&gt;repeatSame as most coins, only we&#039;re not waiting a month or two but days lol.
&gt;&gt;2267996&gt;mfw nigel farage as guest speaker
&gt;&gt;2267490But guys you didn&#039;t even use the fractal chaos bonds/bollinger bands combo to determine to new ATH factoring in the possibility of a whale double-backed crossover manipulation scheme involving segwit currencies on the cryptomarket&gt;you can trust me because i used some long words
&gt;&gt;2268015I miss that fudder, where was he today?
it just tested 2000sats and you fudfags are celebrating a correction.you are going to make this same thread when it dips at 3000? topfucking kek
oh shit bought back in
&gt;&gt;2267996Oh this is the first time I&#039;m hearing about this! Just looked up it seems he wants this to replace the USD!
W E A KHANDS
&gt;&gt;2268036&gt;replace the USD!SELL SELL SELL, IT&#039;S GONNA BE WORTH SHIT
fud cucks. make a new thread quick!!
&gt;&gt;2268009Fiat was a mistake - Nigel Farage
&gt;&gt;2267835but that&#039;s how you make money you idiot, but lying to others so they buy high and sell lowwithout them, it&#039;s impossible to make money
&gt;&gt;2268278Implying /biz/ has any say on market direction, maybe on shit coins with low market caps.
Parabolic SAR indicates the downtrend has begun. Anyone hodling after this point is a madman.
&gt;&gt;2268015&gt;no meme triangleAbsolute bullshit.
Digibyte takes flight today.
&gt;&gt;2268359&gt;&gt;2268015you only need to look at the MACDblack should by on red, it&#039;s due to another dip according to MACD
&gt;&gt;2268008This. The problem is, these dipshit&#039;s don&#039;t understand that natural market growth is the only way to make this coin work. It&#039;s been cheap for too long without a market influencing platform DURING the time a lot of people knew you could get rich quick on crypto. People have been slowly stockpiling this coin over the years. Some people have a LOT and they&#039;re waiting for the right price to dump their bags. I can&#039;t wait to see artificial buy pressure put up by whales get cracked open hard by a major holder who&#039;s ready to exit. Anyone saying &quot;BUY DGB BUY DGB THE PLATFORM THE PLATFORM!!!11!!1!&quot; doesn&#039;t understand that FAST growth = FAST drops.99% babby&#039;s first crypto, all jumping on the hype train and circlejerking shills left and right. Shills victimize people, and it&#039;s a horrible thing to do. This coin will be stuck in pump and dump mode forever barring any REAL market influencing platform. Protip: it will never happen for DGB and no matter how many anime memes you spam out, and no matter how much buy pressure whales put up.. you&#039;re all only compounding the problem 10 fold. These people just don&#039;t understand how markets work.
&gt;&gt;2268293dgb was a shit coin with low market cap. i bought in at 122
&gt;&gt;2268434Right but now it has a market cap of 350million+ so making FUD posts on /biz/ every day is not exactly impacting anything.
&gt;&gt;2268442then who are all the retards like me buying it, if not people who read /biz/? I literally bought it after i saw it on this board.
&gt;&gt;2268451Maybe you should read the chain of replies because I have no fucking idea what you&#039;re trying to say to me in relation to my posts.
bought at ~800, sold at 1850Seems good, but still small profit (cause volume is very small)What the next ?(By the way, i&#039;m still holding the MOON bought at 1sat when it was firstly mentioned here - it had hit 4 sat earlier but i have not sold it)
&gt;&gt;2268463Are you trying to FUD my coins?
&gt;&gt;2268522You&#039;re actually stupid and don&#039;t know how to read. I&#039;m basically saying the FUDders are retarded for trying to FUD all day because ultimately at this point nothing /biz/ does will impact DGB anymore since the market cap is so high. So they are just FUDing to fuck people out of gains because they are salty which is really pathetic.
&gt;&gt;2268563stop fudding DGB
&gt;&gt;2268659Sorry, please buy.
DGB will fall to 800 sats after the presentation.Loads will panic sell, whales will accumulate untill it hits 1200 and starts &quot;recovering&quot;. Then they&#039;ll dump untill it falls to 100 sats where smart /biz/ got in.I hope it doesn&#039;t though DGBchan is cute
&gt;&gt;2268698DGB gets more FUD thrown at it than any other coin. look at the chart to see just how valuable their opinions have been so far. you really want to be another one to add to the screenshot pile? why don&#039;t you do yourself a favor this one time and just buy in.
I noticed that right around the time the spring semester ended there was a surge in activity here and on some of the sub dollar coins. My guess is that a bunch of college students and maybe some autistic neets from hs caught wind of shit and decided to try their hand. When is the next break from college and school? I want to see if I can track that shit.
When it hits you like a ton of bricks: despite the sick crypto gainz you still are not happy
nigga crypto gains are one of the only positives in my life, but thats better than nothing
&gt;&gt;2265045Up to $185,000 now. Actually I&#039;m pretty fucking happy.
&gt;&gt;2265045Find a therapist who accepts btc
&gt;&gt;2265067wait until you meet the tax man.
&gt;&gt;2265045well...you gotta cash a bit out and use that money to get what you really want duh? also, super cliche / normie tier but happiness also comes from positive relationships with other people .
&gt;&gt;2265045Smoke a splif take a walk.
Money won&#039;t change you.See a therapist.
&gt;&gt;2265045What would make you happy now?If you can&#039;t be happy, what could you do now to bring you up to neutral?
&gt;&gt;2265117Because for the first time ever I am making money, but I have no friends, no gf, no family who cares, no hobbies I enjoy .
&gt;&gt;2265122Money wont make you happy but it does open alot of doors for you.
&gt;&gt;2265045Buy a motorcycle you fucking cuck
&gt;&gt;2265122I was called a shill in another thread for posting this link, but I swear that this guy&#039;s content helped me out, and I wish I knew this stuff 20 years ago.http://revolutionarylifestyledesign.com/change-reality-changing-questions/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRF6Xi1xUCUHe has tons of free content, and you really don&#039;t have to buy shit. It&#039;s just good solid advice on life.This would have saved me a lot of heartache had I known this when I was younger.
&gt;&gt;2265170Thanks bro, watching now
&gt;&gt;2265045Crypto is ruining my fucking life, the gains are fucking depressing. Some days i forget to eat anything at all, i drink by myself to go to sleep instead of for fun, i havn&#039;t jerked off in weeks, i check blockfolio when my phone buzzes and forget to read the messages from my friends, stress is through the fucking roof, i&#039;m in a perpetual fucking daze, i&#039;m neglecting my people, my business, my home.I&#039;ve been living in constant fuckign fear for months that i am the normie and today will be the day i get the ass fucking from a huge dick lifer whale, I&#039;m being broken, i&#039;m starting to hope for the ass fucking so it can all be over before I fucking kill myself.
&gt;&gt;2265234&gt;friends

&gt;&gt;2265045i made 16k in the last week and a half.im planning to quit my shitty job and go to the Philippines to whoremonger all day for a month. if that doesnt make me happy ill get one of them pregnant and try being a dad
&gt;&gt;2265312try being a dad to the little guy, his names BEANCOIN! he&#039;ll whoemonger you all day for a month to the MOOON!!!
&gt;&gt;2265338only an idiot would be swayed by your shilling bitbean is one of the shittiest shitcoins.youre probably some broke kid hoping for a miracle
&gt;&gt;2265122Try feeling grateful for fucks sake. In an alternate universe you&#039;re a nocoiner. Pretend you have no friends, no gf, no family who cares, and no hobbies, and you&#039;re a nocoiner. But then you magically change timelines to where you are now. Look upon your gains as if you&#039;re seeing them for the first time.
&gt;&gt;2265234You are over invested friend
&gt;&gt;2265411I just wanted to make a small bet in case the mooning actually happened, i never actually at all considered there would be an agonizing period of space travel involved, i thought i was playing the lottery, i thought the numbers would come up like normal and it would be quick and painless, what is happening is the fucking guy pulling the numbers out is rubbing each one on his balls and pretending to let me see them then hiding it back up his ass and fucking laughing at me.
read &#039;&#039;Buddhism Plain and Simple&#039;&#039; a fellow anon recommended it a while ago and after reading it, now it&#039;s my turn to do the same
Stop making shit threads like this. /biz/ isn&#039;t /r9k/ or /v/
&gt;&gt;2265045youre supposed to withdrawl a few hundred and spend it on asian spa full services. then go back grinding charts because you playing the best mmo of your life.
&gt;&gt;2265045You may find pleasure in doing good thing&#039;s with the money and making the world a better place. Certainly, that can be rewarding. And i don&#039;t mean give it away to these people.
&gt;&gt;2265234get a job and cash out
&gt;&gt;2265045Give me money and i&#039;ll please you
&gt;&gt;2265045I know that feeling.I am a millionaire. All accomplished within a year due to crypto. And yet, I feel something.I don&#039;t want to have sex. I don&#039;t want a relationship. I have no desire to see the world. My family is proud of me but they half consider it expected, especially my father than made his first million at 30.Is there anything that can overcome this annoying nihilism? I just want to be happy.
&gt;&gt;2266314&gt;And yet, I feel something.I feel nothing*Fuck me.
&gt;&gt;2265078&gt;he doesnt hire hitmen using his BTC on the deepweb
&gt;&gt;2266314Got a normal job for a month as waiter, just for the kicks. cry and realize. Live is good
&gt;&gt;2266329I don&#039;t even feel like working anymore.It&#039;s just so boring.
OP, i&#039;ll give you a very important and sound advice so that you stop having this turbo faggot defeatist attitude.Literally every dumb hedonist shit you do and own is ephemeral and won&#039;t give you any fulfillment. It may give you temporary pleasure and instant gratification, but trust me, it will never fill the void within you.If you want to seek true pleasure, true fulfillment, you will need to seek more everlasting things, things besides woman, fapping, friends, lambos, playing vidya, traveling, drugs or whatever. Like for example improving yourself, becoming a better person, acquiring knowledge, learning to know yourself and to love yourself. These are things that will go to the grave with you, they will give you a sense of purpose and importance and no one can&#039;t take that from you. What you have within yourself is the only thing that truly matters, the rest is just transient shit that won&#039;t matter anymore in a few moments.So, money just represents freedom. It&#039;s freedom for you to do whatever you want without having any worries or without having to do anything you don&#039;t wanna do. What you do with this freedom is up to you.So here&#039;s my advice: Start to read more, get knowledge. Work out. Learn a new language or a instrument. Try to understand the things that surround you. If you have money, maybe try to build some kind of business related to something you believe in or like, or think will pay off. Be good with other people. And always remember that no one will love you if you don&#039;t love yourself.
But crypto buys drugs so how can you be unhappy? Fuck it, who am I kidding? I&#039;m addicted to heroin and fentanyl now because of spending crypto gainz on the darknet. At least I can afford it though, so there&#039;s an upside
&gt;&gt;2266348At work right now . Can&#039;t motivate myself I just want to read about crypto.
&gt;&gt;2265188&gt;&gt;2265298You&#039;re welcome guys. I hope you guys live happier lives from here on out.
&gt;&gt;2265170Thank you for positing this. Keep the positivity flowing
&gt;&gt;2266380Improving the self is worthless without a goal and when you don&#039;t desire anything. Work on yourself to be confident.... for what?What if I don&#039;t believe or seek to do good for other people because I don&#039;t care for others?What if I don&#039;t want anything regarding hedonism yet also find no value in altruism?I don&#039;t want to read books, I&#039;m only mildly interested in going back to uni just for the kicks and nothing else matters.What can I do if I have the freedom to do anything yet desire nothing?&gt;&gt;2266396Seeing money go up and down is honestly the only joy I feel left and I don&#039;t even care about the money I make.
&gt;&gt;2266380Good shit anon. This is a high like any other for people to use as an escape
&gt;&gt;2265160lmao!!! i totally thought about this too
&gt;&gt;2266380&gt;&gt;2266389i would just get hookers. hookers and make music or play counterstrike while on perscription meds.fuck it, i want on this new video game called crypto trading.
&gt;&gt;2265234you sound stressed out my friend, let me take some of your burden from you, share the load ;pbtc - 1DCkNkphBe3WeNDS3HpKA173oU2Hghfhpn
Done playing dota for the thrill of +/- 25 mmr. Now its all about the thrill of coin gains
i&#039;m a boring and depressed person and will likely be the same even when I reach LamboLand.Its just that by then I wouldn&#039;t have to work and pretend to be happy among the easily spooked normies.
&gt;&gt;2265312&gt;im planning to quit my shitty job and go to the Philippines to whoremonger all day for a month. if that doesnt make me happy ill get one of them pregnant and try being a dadget the fuck off this board.
&gt;&gt;2265809BUY AND HOLD
&gt;&gt;2266414Did you even read what I said? Here&#039;s the thing: Improving yourself IS the goal and it&#039;s the only goal that will actually leave you fulfilled at the end of the day. Girls that you fuck, money you own, video games you play, companies you build, drugs you use, all these things will go away as easily as they came to you. The only thing that will ALWAYS stay with you is what it is within yourself.&gt; Work on yourself to be confident.... for what?It&#039;s not to be confident, confidence is something that comes naturally after doing this things. You don&#039;t do this to became confident, you do it to improve yourself and to build inner life in you.&gt;What if I don&#039;t believe or seek to do good for other people because I don&#039;t care for others?You may not care. But take my advice since you seem sad and don&#039;t have much to lose anyway: Doing good for other people will actually do wonders for you, but you will never be able to be good with others if you aren&#039;t good with yourself. This may seem like generic motivational talk, but believe me, it&#039;s true. And anyway, don&#039;t take the advice at face value, you don&#039;t need to do exactly what I said. You just need to do anything to improve yourself as a person and to then, look in the mirror and be proud of what you are.&gt;I don&#039;t want to read booksNo one is interested in anything until they actually try. There has to be something you have an interest in, It can be anything, start from there, you will develop the pleasure of reading and adquiring knowloge as time goes on.&gt;What can I do if I have the freedom to do anything yet desire nothing?You have to force your way. The things I mentioned, they may seem like shit you don&#039;t wanna bother with right now, but if you actually start any of them, things may kick off, or they may not. What do you have to lose anyway?I once was in a similar situation to yours, which came after years of hedonistic lifestyle. The only thing that actually made me help is what I&#039;m telling you.
&gt;&gt;2266549I see. I will take your words to heart then and hopefully in a year or two, I&#039;ll be happier.
&gt;&gt;2266570cheers mate. I hope you do well. Good things will come to you when you start to be good with yourself.
&gt;&gt;2265108Therapy is useless. But the true solution is in your ID
&gt;&gt;2266548I will hodl until I the day I turn up to that lambo dealership looking like a distressed fucking wild dog and drive one off the floor.

&gt;tfw sold all my ETH for DGB and STRAT
Seems like a good move
&gt;&gt;2267325Fair enough. ETH is my safe hedge though. I don&#039;t hold BTC at all.So still high on the risk-scale but not as high as you.
Buy high sell low right?I&#039;ll wait for the dipstfw bought dgb 106 sold 580
ETH is for HODLing not shorting you dumb NEET.Ditch the DGB and put it all in STRAT though so you&#039;ll make SOME gains at least.
&gt;&gt;2267372fucking off with your jew illuminati coineth and xrp will bring you profit as long as the banks &amp; ceos keep pumping them, talk about pumping...If they don&#039;t take off sooner or later banks will invest in new, better shit
&gt;&gt;2267325BUY BACK DGB NIGGER
I dont touch my ether, they are all in cold storagei do hold a bit of dgb aswell, but i only see it as a way to get more ether
Are we on laggards or late majority phase?
&gt;&gt;2268193Not sure but by the looks of it everything is going to come crashing down real soon.
&gt;&gt;2268193We&#039;ve just entered Early Majority IMO.
&gt;&gt;2268193The very very start of early majority
&gt;&gt;2268193I would be surprised if even 1% of my country traded bitcoin.I would say we are still in the Innovators phase
until recently it was just a bunch of autists and junkies using bitcoin to get drugs, I&#039;d say we&#039;re probably somewhere in the first quartile as there&#039;s plenty of new tech and some use for public emerging. Somewhere in &#039;early adopters&#039; is my guess.
&gt;&gt;2268275there have been alternative investors in bitcoin for some time now
I don&#039;t know a single person IRL that trades cryptos.I study comp sci and maybe half the students have even heard of btc.
&gt;&gt;2268200&gt;early majority&gt;literally nobody outside internet forums knows what bitcoin iswe are still early adopters
&gt;&gt;2268225That&#039;s exactly what a laggard would say
&gt;&gt;2268193You dont spend much time off the internet do you? Theres no way in hell any more than 2-5% of the US pop is into crypto. Its still all people who were already heavily into tech that are in crypto right now - and not even the majority of tech people are into it.
&gt;&gt;2268353A significant number of people may never get into crypto though. 50% of the population doesn&#039;t buy tampons, doesn&#039;t mean that market isn&#039;t saturated
&gt;&gt;2268193Is it safe to get in now? Should I get in now?DGB and XBY already pumped. I have RDD and XVG left. But I need to find more.
&gt;&gt;2268363You dont think crypto is going to eventually seep into everyday life? Everyone can use crypto. Tampons are a bad example.
&gt;&gt;2268363&gt;banks are corrupt&gt;governments are corrupt&gt;crypto is a solution for major economic issues and some of the brightest minds in the world are working on it&gt;people r never gonna use it lol
&gt;&gt;2268383Eventually, maybe, but we could be a long way away from that. I&#039;m not saying there isn&#039;t a lot of room for growth, but expecting the entire 50+ population to suddenly go crypto is wishful thinking. This will take a generation.
&gt;&gt;2268383People without moneyPeople without interest in tech beyond snapchatIt is debatable.
&gt;&gt;2268299I&#039;d say they were the innovators/early stage of early adopters maybe. There&#039;s no timeframe specified and the curve doesn&#039;t have to fit exactly.But you might be right, if you&#039;d consider each major spike and correction as a beginning for new bunch of investors it could sort of make sense. By comparing trading volumes just before gox crash to the most recent one we&#039;ve got around 2x increase, which could indicate we should still be in early adopters phase. I only had a look at the spikes though, it&#039;d be better to take an average and still it&#039;s just my autistic theory.
&gt;&gt;2268386The implications even for retail businesses are huge. If you sell expensive items most people will pay with credit card because most banks don&#039;t allow large amounts to be withdrawn via normal ATM cards. You are basically forced to hand over between 1% to 3% to master card or amex on every sale. When profit margins on expensive items are only 10% or less those fees become a big issue.
&gt;&gt;2268193Late majority most likely.&gt;&gt;2268198This, the normies are investing, so crash soon. Expect 80% correction.
&gt;&gt;2268407both of those groups are being actively targeted by multiple projects right now.&gt;humaniq&gt;reddcoincrypto will enter people&#039;s lives without their seeking it out once it passes a certain point.
Yeah keep telling yourselves it&#039;s still early
IMO it&#039;s early adopters/early majority at most&gt;tfw you got into crypto a month ago as an early adopter before the hype truly took off&gt;tfw newcoiners cucked
&gt;&gt;2268363Tampons... Saturated
&gt;&gt;2268482&gt;institutional&gt;still not even 100 billion market cap on all of cryptoloving every laugh
&gt;&gt;2268482This. I hate these copefucks so much. &quot;Hurr, durr, we are early genius investors guys!!&quot;no, fucker, if this is on Bloomberg regularly, you are late majority. Deal with it.You know who were the early adopters? Those who bought Bitcoin sub 100$ and Ethereum sub 10$. Everyone else is a dumb laggard normie. Go cope somewhere else bitch
&gt;&gt;2268193early adopters, there&#039;s 40k people logged on exchanges, it&#039;s fucking nothing.we are not in any kind of majority.
&gt;&gt;2268500A year from now you&#039;ll see this post about STRAT, Waves, and Blocknet.Two years from now you&#039;ll see this about XRP, DGB, and ARK.3 years who knows? But you&#039;ll STILL see these fud posts.
&gt;&gt;2268193still early adopters
&gt;&gt;2268500BTC was on Bloomberg regularly circa 2013 as well
&gt;&gt;2268198Yep, this second pump looks manipulated af.This crash will have no survivors. The smart ones are already in fiat.
&gt;&gt;22684192x as in fiat or coins?
&gt;&gt;2268500Well I guess crypto is over then. No more money to be made since Bloomberg writes about it.I guess everyone in your neighborhood has some bitcoin and ethereum holdings now then? Do you even outside?
&gt;&gt;2268561fiat, I didn&#039;t take account for the supply at the time
&gt;&gt;2268200&gt;&gt;2268225You think 15% of the population deals with crypto?
&gt;&gt;2268500i bought eth at 10 each just a few months ago. you dont go from early adopters to laggards in a couple of monthslook at the total market cap of cryptos then consider that it will be an international phenomenon and will probably grow for many years. we are still early.
&gt;&gt;2268554It has at least another day to go imo. Tonight&#039;s CN cycle will indicate whether we&#039;ve peaked or not, but I expect to see $2650 during USA today
I just got in yesterday and am up 50 percent. I think there is a lot of room to run at least point shitcoins. I might not be able to afford a lambo getting in at this time, but maybe a Tesla.Of course I realize this could all come crashing down tommorow, but so could the stock market, society, anything.
&gt;&gt;2268623&gt;&gt;2268554Fucking hell, I&#039;ve been waiting for a dip to get in, but all of my top 10 picks keep pumping by 20-60% every day, and it&#039;s been this way since last week. Is this ever going to stop? Fuck
&gt;&gt;2268632Yeah there are no guarantees even in just holding fiat.
&gt;&gt;2268632&gt;I just got in yesterday and am up 50 percent.&gt;Of course I realize this could all come crashing down tommorow&gt;I might not be able to afford a lambo getting in at this time, but maybe a Tesla.You&#039;re getting a 2001 Ford Taurus with that mindset. If you can&#039;t recognize a bull market when all the bulls are charging to $3k after a +/-1000USD price swing, you&#039;ve got no hope.&gt;&gt;2268657Keep your eye on the crypto charts. The sell-offs should begin just short of the last ATH.
Is it safe to get in now? Or are we still in a bubble ready to pop? I sold all my BTC at 2200$
&gt;&gt;2268657dont wait for dips when coins are surging. this isnt the stock market.
&gt;&gt;2268193early, early adopters
&gt;&gt;2268682&gt;I sold all my BTCit&#039;s too late for you, jelly hands.
&gt;&gt;2268583100% of the population is never going to deal with crypto. Never, ever.Though I think we&#039;re not near early majority yet.
POSW has been quietly recovering.Why is no one talking about it?
because it&#039;s still the ultimate shitcoin, literally for african childreninvest in a coin that isn&#039;t a complete joke, like Iconomi
I think the DEV are changing their approach after the crash. Not saying go ahead and buy a bunch but if you&#039;ve been holding the coins, keep holding.
because its a coin that doesn&#039;t do anything at all, the only thing it has going for it, is that its tied to some no-name backwater crypto exchange with barely any trafic at allyour coin&#039;s success is dependant on poswallet.com&#039;s successgo shill the exchange, not the coin, if you want it to increase
&gt;&gt;2266330Bought at .10 cents a piece so it&#039;s nice to break even. I guess I&#039;ll holder over the summer see where it goes.
&gt;&gt;2266296Are you me? That&#039;s literally what I did when I cut my losses with this shitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2266288There are multiple threads everyday on this shitcoin. We don&#039;t need anymore.
&gt;&gt;2266288you don&#039;t talk about posw here in /biz/same for stratis, waves, steem, zcash
&gt;&gt;2266511&gt;cut my lossesaka bought high and sold low, good job.
&gt;&gt;2266756thanks anon for reminding me about steemwill look good in my portfolio
Whales are accumulating so it&#039;s good to keep the FUD going for a while until july masternodes and ETH going PoS make it a $10 coin.
&gt;&gt;2268316but eth isn&#039;t going full PoSdid any of you niggers even read the Casper proposal
&gt;&gt;2266992&gt;buying steemIf anons here put the Energy they had posting here, to posting on steemit, they&#039;d have money to invest crypto in. Its basically like leddit + tumblr and you get paid for upvotes
&gt;&gt;2268316I hope the dev won&#039;t give our shit to those monkeys in Africa
&gt;&gt;2268603did he say that in the slack or is there an ann or something about that?
&gt;&gt;2268603&gt;Blue colored coinDigibytes confirmed
&gt;&gt;2268337&gt;but eth isn&#039;t going full PoSYes it is dumbass.
sold all mine at 9kgonna buy back in because this price is sweet and stable so theres good potential
&gt;&gt;2266288how do you stake these coins? where is the wallet?
&gt;&gt;2266340yeah posw is just a shitcoin so dump it while it&#039;s on ath
&gt;tfw you keep missing all those boats and don&#039;t buy when the coin is flatDon&#039;t make the same mistake and buy POSW while that 2 cent peak still looks like a big deal. It will look flat once it goes +$1STRAT, WAVES, DGB, XBY... you name it. All those are already too late to invest at if you want to get rich.
&gt;&gt;2268338Ponzicoin
&gt;&gt;2268355This is how you cope?
&gt;&gt;2268338Show me your buys anon, how much bags are you holding to still shill piece of shit wallet in June?
&gt;&gt;2268338If they introduced a much simpler interface, like Bittrex, sorted their shit out re. staking, and ETH really does go POS, then the coin will got to $10.But I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath with the retard devs. I&#039;m hoping they&#039;ll surprise us with POSWallet 2.0 though

What are you going to do about this you useless fucking cunts? You ruined my life. I feel no different than from when I was a neet weaboo fuck like you all. Bloody shitfucks.
did you buy a wave runner yet?
&gt;repostingFuck off
&gt;&gt;2265644You forgot to become a Christian, faggot. Your fault.
&gt;&gt;2265644/biz/ didnt exist 3 years ago let alone 7 but nice larping
&gt;&gt;2265644You did well.Congratulation, son.Only shit people think it was luck.
&gt;&gt;2265650daniel pls
&gt;&gt;2265665I started college and had doubts about my future. I used to come here back then and ask and you all said making money is number one key. Fuck you!
Well since you have the resources, what WILL make you happy, anon?Money is NOT everything. It cannot buy you happiness, but it should be able to buy you freedom and choices. What are your hobbies? Passions? Want to travel, learn a skill, write? You can do it with money.Figure out what you want. Hint: material things usually aren&#039;t it.
&gt;&gt;2265644lol you&#039;re retardedIf you focus entirely on money without realizing that money is simply a means to an end then you are a foollook into gross domestic happiness in bhutan, look into finding yourselfs c r u b
&gt;&gt;2265644So then can I have your money?
&gt;&gt;2265678Well I don&#039;t know what to tell you making money is number one key.Maybe your aren&#039;t human so it don&#039;t work for you, go home to your home planet maybe you find &quot;happiness&quot; there subhuman lol
&gt;&gt;2265644Why did you go back to accounting? Maybe that&#039;s the problem. Stop doing accounting.
&gt;&gt;2265644pic of porsche
&gt;&gt;2265644Who said this? Other businessmen?You&#039;re not aware of all the saying, &quot;Money doesn&#039;t buy happiness&quot;You&#039;re not aware of all the ancient Greek philosophers who said this thousands of years ago as well? You&#039;re not awareSorry OP you&#039;ve been fooled by consumer capitalism, by the machine that our society is. You&#039;ve turned yourself into a cogThis isn&#039;t just hippy nonsense, it&#039;s literally the truth.The good part is one you realize this you can exit the machine at any time. Earn some money and retire early and start living life the right way. Want to know how?I&#039;ll get called a cuck for saying this but it&#039;s the truth:-Donate to worthwhile causes to help people. Starving children in Africa, it&#039;s not a meme there are literally children starving and you can donate and help them-Political activism - get this moron climate change denier out of office, help campaign against him-Learning - learn things, read books, literature-Experiences - travel around the world and help people everywhere you go. Talk to random old grandpas in tea shopsThat being said, I&#039;m in your same position but I&#039;m also a turbo autist so maybe ignore me. But I&#039;m right and you know it.
&gt;&gt;2265718you&#039;re alright, anon.
&gt;&gt;2265644Assuming you aren&#039;t leaping it must be a 5 year old Boxster top kek
&gt;&gt;2265668not daniel but look. buy a fucking pinball machine tell me how sad you are
&gt;&gt;2265718you get called a cuck because theres people with enough money to;- feed all the starving kids not in africa but the entire world (oprah gave a car to everybody in her audience the same price wouldve bought a few planes full of fucking rice)-what type of climate change is he denying? either way the planet will do fine. with or without us. just look at mercury.
&gt;&gt;2265644&gt;blow your money on an overpriced vehicle&gt;expect permanent happinessWhy not travel and experience life with that money? No one cares what your vehicle looks like while you drive to taco bell.
&gt;&gt;2265718Hello David Brock
&gt;&gt;2265644/biz/ didn&#039;t exist 7 years ago faggot. nice try homo
&gt;&gt;2265735&gt;Take home 150,000&gt;Live in dad&#039;s basementTry again, nigger. Porsche 911. Basic package but still.
&gt;&gt;2265718nice post sir
&gt;&gt;2265718&gt;-Learning - learn things, read books, literatureThis is why you never hear actual rich people complain. They soak themselves into books, their bodies and helping those around them. People who are rich and cry &quot;money doesn&#039;t buy happiness&quot; are selfish cunts. Poor people who repeat such are wanna be greedy faggots.Now stop being a greedy Jew OP and start being a giving greedy Jew. Not talking about giving drug addicts money, but I&#039;m talking about giving actual people assistance.Please for the love of god lobby the government towards good. That shit is out of hand and needs some lobbying for the better of man-kind - ffs.
&gt;&gt;2265644&gt;You fuckers said money was everything. I believed you.Problem is you don&#039;t have enough money. $230,000 is not enough.You need more money to be happy.Porsche is shit, you need a lambo and crypto coins.If you are not happy, remember, you need MORE money. Go work HARDER.
&gt;&gt;2266149&gt;If you are not happy, remember, you need MORE money. Go work HARDER.topkek
Enjoy life anon. With money you can buy what&#039;s the most important resource in the world: time.Go travel, rock climbing, buy and use an expensive bike, try nice restaurant, go the the opera, do whateve the fuck you want.You are free, almost. Keep growing that money untill is almost passive and you can enjoy life 100% without worrying.
&gt;&gt;2265718Agreed with helping other people but focus on helping your community and country. Sending money to Africa is a lost cause and you don&#039;t have to be a /pol/tard to know that.In the immortal words of one Snoop Doggy Dogg:&quot;It ain&#039;t fun if the homies can&#039;t have none.&quot;
&gt;&gt;2266370&gt;In the immortal words of one Snoop Doggy Dogg:&gt;&quot;It ain&#039;t fun if the homies can&#039;t have none.&quot;ThisAnon know what the funnest shit ever is? Take your bros out for a drink and let them have the good shit. Yeah they&#039;re using you for free drinks, who cares? It&#039;s a laughFirst thing on my list then is how the fuck do I get some bros...But before that how the fuck do I leave the house without panickingHaha jk.
&gt;&gt;2265644I grew up eating out of dumpsters. Stop being a sad cunt. I&#039;d kill to be in your shoes.

&gt;&gt;2266556&gt;Motherfucking kill yourself you shithead marxist.You have a really warped view of reality. Not everyone who cares about other people is a marxist. I am surely not.
&gt;&gt;2265718This wasn&#039;t a bad post until you started to go full POSW
&gt;&gt;2265644You should be proud of yourself.
&gt;&gt;2265644Just imagine how much more unhappy you&#039;d be if you didn&#039;t have money.

&gt;&gt;2265718&gt;Starving children in AfricaMY FAVORITE MEME
&gt;&gt;2265718&gt;I&#039;m a turbo autistThis explains the rest of your post.
There&#039;s this false notion that humans are meant to he happy. If that were the case we&#039;d have never left the caves or colonized the earth.Happiness is just the momentary joy you feel when you accomplish a goal. Happiness is not a long term state of being.I highly recommend you read this Schopenhauer essay. It has everything you need to know to lead a good life.https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/wisdom/introduction.html

&gt;&gt;2265644Should&#039;ve gotten a woman while studying.
&gt;&gt;2265644Give me your money if you hate it so much.
Try volunteering at your local homeless shelter or food bank. Actually helping and giving money to these types of charities really does fill the emptiness in your heart.
Do you faggots even realise that helping all those poor children on Africa is just going to lead to even MORE starving children in Africa? Africa is hugely overpopulated right now and women there are STILL churning out 5-7 children each. Do you think the African population can just keep growing exponentially? Idiots. But, hey, let&#039;s just keep giving and giving in order to stroke our own egos and &quot;feel good&quot;
&gt; 200k a yearI thought you said you&#039;re rich anon? No wonder you&#039;re unhappy with your poorfag self
Find a purpose OPHelp your community
&gt;&gt;2265686&gt;&gt;2265644&gt;this OPMoney in itself won&#039;t make you happy, but you need at least some of it to be happy, and the more you have the more potential your life has. It&#039;s kind of like a prerequisite of happiness, but it won&#039;t give it to you in itself.
&gt;&gt;2265644everything above the money you need to retire is meaningless.
&gt;&gt;2267745Exactly. OP is actually poor, 200k$ is nothing. Kill yourself OP, you are a loser!
It is all luckone bear market and your shitty pizza chain will evaporatebut that doesn&#039;t matter, money is everything, nothing has changedyou just don&#039;t understand what happiness isthat&#039;s ok, most people don&#039;t

Any thoughts on this?Let&#039;s say I wanted to invest $20,000 in one of them, which one would it be?
XBY will, within a few days
&gt;&gt;2267735XVGNormie fb currency of cool hackerman currency. The choice is easy.
XVG is actually not that bad. If XMR dev pulls another stunt I could see XVG gaining popularity.
&gt;&gt;2267989Does XMR run on a tor network as well. What are the privacy and anonymity difference between XVG and XMR and even Zcash for that matter. And aside from what op said, what is the reality that they will hit even .01?
&gt;&gt;2267989&gt;pulls another stuntPlease explain further. I have a substantial holding in XMR..... s-should I sell??
Xvg over rdd. I already doubled my investment on it
ok crypto early adopterslets be realhow many of you have actually used BTC or LTC or whatever to purchase somethingwhen you want to buy something do you actually use an online bitcoin shop instead of amazon?
reporting
&gt;&gt;2268227Used BTC many times, games, ebooks, physical stores such as CEX on the UK. Also sold old games/hardware for BTC
I would have if I had like 100 BTC or so, but having only 0.4, I really have to save it until it&#039;s worth something more
I guess I should chime in too since i made the threadI have used BTC only twice as an actual currency, and both times on Steamonce I tried to pay for something on Dell.com with BTC and the coins were withdrawn from my wallet but the transaction was never completed and I had to go through a whole runaround with their support to get a refund (a check came in the mail)
&gt;&gt;2268280I have used BTC more often to send money to friends than to buy things at online stores
Do you guys believe that using BTC as a currency to buy things will help crypto adoption in the long run?should I be buying everything from bitcoin shops instead of amazon from now on?
&gt;&gt;2268227Used DGB to buy a steam card once... i regret not just holding it and waiting
&gt;&gt;2268280if transaction is not confirmed by the network, you can still cancel it.If it was confirmed, then it went to the deposit address.no 2 ways around it
&gt;&gt;2268336actually a good way to help adoption is by people who have thousands to do this. If a few people have a lot, then nobody uses it, and it dies.Dogecoin was so successful back in the day because we were giving away dogecoins all day, I gave at least to 100 people 1000 DOGE each
&gt;&gt;2268370No the bitcoin transaction went onto the blockchain just fineIt was Dell&#039;s shitty checkout website that was fucking up and not registering that i had paid
friend paid for his VPN with bitcoin
&gt;&gt;2268227&gt;how many of you have actually used BTC or LTC or whatever to purchase somethingdo drugs count
&gt;tfw a friend bought mdma with btc and it killed him&gt;his mother went on a huge anti bitcoin crusade for a while after it happened&gt;a few media outlets reported on iti wasnt really close friends with the dude but fuck it was brutal
&gt;&gt;2268385I see
&gt;&gt;2268392this
I used 250 bitcoins to buy pot once
&gt;&gt;2268409you must be drowning in POT then
&gt;&gt;2268409Gary?
Bought LedgerBought VISABought TrezorBought VPN
I bought my Nano wallet with Litecoin recently using Coinpayments.com. It was fun, and I&#039;m excited that a lot of japanese retailers are gona start accepting BTC.
&gt;&gt;2268392ThisBought some DMT with bitcoin a while back. That&#039;s about it though.. if the infrastructure was there I would be using it often though and I believe the infrastructure is on its way
Used it alot to order goods or foods, most is in cold storage though
I&#039;ve bought porn I couldn&#039;t find for free with btc
&gt;&gt;2268336no anon, bitcoin will be worth way more if it never has any utility at all.

Why haven&#039;t you invested in RLT yet?&gt;working product and active users of service&gt;get dividends for holding&gt;bittrex confirmed: https://smartplay.tech/news/the-access-to-the-game-website-has-been-restricred-to-us-residents&gt;volume is increasingANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1826686.0Grab it on Livecoin before Bittrex: https://www.livecoin.net/en/trade/index?currencyPair=RLT%2FBTCYeah, I do want the price increase as I&#039;m holding but nothing I&#039;ve said is a lie and it is a decent investment.Up to you.
Seems promising. Will throw 0.3btc at it
&gt;&gt;2264930I actually bought OP
Volume has been increasingly heading up. I popped a bit in.
Will moon by atleast 3x next week
wow this is going to be huge
&gt;&gt;2264930Im in, I see the potential for moon
holding just over 1000 RLT, i can&#039;t believe i was able to finally get into something early, this shit could very very easily skyrocket
&gt;&gt;2265726pretty hyped about this coin, no one is talking about it though and /biz/ will get pissed off for missing it as usual, its still dirt cheap
&gt;&gt;2265958agreed, with marketing and bittrex it is easily a 4x coin
for /biz/ bros browsing:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1826686.0The hype starts June 5th, Prices are still hovering just over ICO price, don&#039;t miss another gold rush
&gt;&gt;2266032Not to mention the Bittrex. God damn, finally i got in early
holding 100 of those. Hope it moon when it goes on bittrex
how long does livecoin take to confirm ETH deposit? taking forever
EDG master racefuck the RLT plebs
can&#039;t even track on blockfolio
&gt;&gt;2266358Usually no more than 20mins.&gt;&gt;2266381Let&#039;s begin, retard:&gt;EDG has no working product that brings in cash, RLT Ddoes.&gt;EDG will be edgeless meaning that they will have less money for marketing and promotions and it&#039;s all the gamblers care about, house edge also helps staying solvent. RLT has 2.47% edge. RLT runs on smart contracts so it is fully transparent.&gt;Holding EDG lets you be in a lottery for a share of profits, so in other words holding EDG might not do you any good, also you can&#039;t gamble with EDG. RLT pays all token holders dividends on daily basis, so you have a steady cash flow, RLT also lets you gamble with ETH and RLT, meaning that demand and volume for RLT will be increased by gamblers.Also RLT is releasing their full roulette version in two days. EDG might or might not release it in 6 months
&gt;&gt;2266405Blockfolio confirmed that they&#039;re adding livecoin very soon
&gt;&gt;2266428i&#039;ve already bought in, just annoying
&gt;&gt;2266449yeah, it&#039;s because livecoin is relatively new. But someone in MNE thread has reached out to blockfolio devs and they confirmed that livecoin is being integrated to Blockfolio.Also seems that RLT started to moon
&gt;&gt;2266456probably going to throw enough in for the safe 1K before this moons too hard
Already holdingCan confirm op is correct
Where do you setup 2FA on this website? I honestly can&#039;t find it.
&gt;&gt;2266661Sorry, I missed the &quot;Security&quot; tab. 0.2% is actually nice, I&#039;ll throw a couple of btc to invest on some other shitcoins there.
bought the dip, now hold over 6k RLT
I&#039;m inTo the moon
You fuckers are missing out on the blitz to the Moon. This shit is the first side chain on stratus get in!
&gt;bitb moons&gt;wat&gt;read their whitepaper&gt;they actually have decent tech&gt;it&#039;s actually a coin that can be used in the future&gt;instead, I listened to fuds saying how their coins are shit and devs are pajeets and not to be trustedwhyI could&#039;ve bought a million of them last month
&gt;&gt;2268465I did buy a million of them last month for 200 dollarsnow worth 2000 dollars ;^)
Nice, going to buy 1 million as well! Just to be sure
Just graduated college (finance major), offered a full time position @ 36k yr plus benefits. Can still live for free with parents and they supply food/comcast/etc in a very high COL city. Whats next /biz/? should I kill myself? should I jump for joy? should I take it and apply to other jobs while in it? Someone give me a plan.
OP here, want to add that I have no debt whatsoever and ~10k total in investments
&gt;&gt;2265917Would it be a good stepping stone? If so, work there. If not, don&#039;t.Do you have to sign anything promising you&#039;ll work there a year, or repay training if you quit etc.? If not, I&#039;d take it.Wait two years before applying to jobs. If it&#039;s really hell on earth, wait one year.One of the good things is in two years, if a lowball offer comes in, you can just say no and keep getting paid. Right now saying no gets you $0.
&gt;&gt;2265917Tell them you just graduated, and that you don&#039;t want more, you NEED more.then unzips dickthat&#039;s how it works in the movies - er.. i mean ive never had a job so not much ican say
OP, you have a good start. Start there, then in about a year see what the job market looks like. No student loans? Nice.
Take that job and since you live for free with parents just invest every single bit of free money you have. With good investments you could end up retiring in your 30&#039;s.
&gt;&gt;2267520this.also, always easier to find a job if you already have a job.
Invest and save. Move out when you find a woman you want to live with. I&#039;d advise getting a masters and getting your job to pay for it.
Invest in Sia
Sell now before its too late.Don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.
&gt;&gt;2267754&quot;Return to normal&quot; is a lie
&gt;&gt;2267754That chart doesn&#039;t fucking fit.Look, the &quot;return to normal&quot; should be lower.Although...
Everything is fine.
i wont be scared of beartrap
&gt;&gt;2267754go away with your memegraph. not happening.

you friccin moron
&gt;&gt;2267948Same. How the fuck did that shitcoin reach 100 sats...
&gt;&gt;2268174Psst, BTC in a bubble = everything in a bubble
&gt;&gt;2268181but muh DGB
&gt;&gt;2268189DGB was obviously a very smart buy for people getting it yesterday or earlier. Time to sell now though.
&gt;&gt;2268174Most likely pnd
&gt;suddenly own 2k worth of bitbeanslol
&gt;&gt;2268194I know. I&#039;m just memeing. I don&#039;t gamble on shitcoins.
&gt;&gt;2268194bought at ~800, sold at 1850Seems good, but still small profit (cause volume is very small)What the next ?(By the way, i&#039;m still holding the MOON bought at 1sat when it was firstly mentioned here - it had hit 4 sat earlier but i have not sold it)
&gt;&gt;2267948stay poor nobeaners

Post yfw this coin will soon be the next DGB. I will fucking laugh at all of you hating on my little Mooncoin buddy, as soon as he grows up and will buy me a Lambo, because I trusted him
shill
&gt;&gt;2268367I really am not a shill. But I&#039;d love to see the butthurt when it will be actually worth something
I fucking hope the community rallies and goes full shill on this coin. Hype is a real variable in price and if people just blindly hype it eventually something will happen.
&gt;follow twitter traders&gt;every call they make has been mostly right&gt;feeling serious FOMO now&gt;twitter goes crazy saying XRP and ETC reversal incoming&gt;graphs and everything&gt;looks legit&gt;invest heavily in both&gt;they are still plummeting to this dayIts like the universe is personally mocking me
recommend me some twitter traders
&gt;&gt;2267320How can I? I can unrecommend cryptoyoda that nigger shilled ETC and said there will be a massive moon mission, but it fell below the support line now i&#039;m holding HEAVY bags.
links who do you follow ?
&gt;&gt;2267320Just get the idiots with the most followers. Then look for when they&#039;re hyping some low volume shitcoin.Likely their followers would be enough to start some kind of moon mission.Don&#039;t trust those twittertards when it comes to popular coins with a lot of volume. They don&#039;t have enough reach to move the markets there.&gt;but but muh fundamentals and signalsget lost. there&#039;s no such thing with coins. it&#039;s all a gamble. even btc.
&gt;&gt;2267347&gt;that nigger shilled ETCETC is a scam. cryptoyoda is a pumper for pushing it.
&gt; start discussion how he follow people who make profit&gt; cry like fag&gt; doesn&#039;t provide info who he follows.
&gt;&gt;2267299How is XRP &quot;plummeting&quot;? If you bought in at the absolute top, then yes, you might be temporarily in the red, but the longterm growth potential is huge. Learn some patience.What has plummeted, is the quality of this board. A lot of scum from low quality boards like /pol/ and /r9k/ has poured over during this crypto boom.
&gt;&gt;2267382Well I don&#039;t even know where to begin looking for &quot;the guy with the most followers&quot;, I don&#039;t use the webstie very oftengive me some names

&gt;&gt;2268415low volume tho
Can someone inform me about waves? is it worth buying now and what is so good about it?
Direct competitor to ETH. Expect this to hit at least $40 in it&#039;s lifetime. It probably won&#039;t ever beat ETH but it will be a good 2nd choice.
&gt;&gt;2267143Why would someone go for the waves network instead of Ethereum then?
&gt;&gt;2267123A distributed exchange integrated into the wallet. That shit is revolutionary. It will effectively replace poloniex, bittrex, etc
&gt;&gt;2267123Waves is one of the 5 coins you should buy and HOLD!
&gt;&gt;2267123Now&#039;s your chance to buy the dip, a whale just cashed out
What are the other 5 coins?
Waves is not fit to be a top 10 coin if volume is so low that a small whale can crash the price so much. Look at Digibyte on Poloniex to see what real volume is.
&gt;&gt;2267221Try out their client. It&#039;s pretty intuitive for normal people. Accessibility is their goal, and it shows.
&gt;&gt;2267352&gt;one of 5&gt;what are the other 5?
Try their chrome wallet appIt&#039;s really sleek.
&gt;&gt;2267479stratis &gt; dgb &gt; waves &gt; siacoin &gt; verge
&gt;&gt;2267338What dip? From 6 to what it is now?Bought some of these when they were $1,50. Should I wait to cash out, how likely are these to absolutely plummet in value?
&gt;&gt;2267535no chance unless there&#039;s another huge market correction but we just had one 1 week agonow everything is mooning can&#039;t go wrong
waves is making me lots of profit, constantly rising and it wont stopmight hit 100$ by the end of the summer. Great technology, Im already using the Waves decentralized Exchange
&gt;&gt;2267479BTCETHWAVDGBand your personal beloved coinThese are for HOLDING! not daytrading!
&gt;wanted to buy waves&gt;send the exchange an hour ago&gt;changelly still cucking me and it&#039;s pendinghope it doesn&#039;t moon until ti goes through
Worth it to buy now? I fucking know guys who bought 40000 of these at 0.20.
&gt;&gt;2267634I would say yes.Waves will be 10$ this year.You just have to hold, that is the thing.You can lend you Waves inside the wallet to miners and get a part of the miner reward btw.
is it over lads?
I want to get in but those walls are scaring me. Should I still go in biz? I trusted you guys with DGB and it paid off.
&gt;&gt;2267797Someone needed to cash out fast. Dumb idea to cash out with such low volume.
Waves is nice
remember when this shit was shilled all last year?
&gt;&gt;2267307And the other four? My guys is sys xvg gnt and digi
Waves isn&#039;t going much higher unless it gets on Poloniex or some other major exchange. Without the heavy volume of a major exchange it is too easy for a small whale to tank the price.
&gt;&gt;2268182You have been saying this since it was a fucking dollar.
WAVES is now the only top 20 crypto not on Polo. It&#039;s gotten this far without Polo, what happens when they add it?It would create a big dump sink, but it may absorb the dump as well.
&gt;&gt;2267634I bought 14K at that price....constantly thinking &quot;REEEE WHEN SHOULD I SELL!?&quot;
&gt;&gt;2267990Yeah retarded right? I mean if I would try and cash out I would do it slowly. Sell walls of 2K or smth.
ITT: We discuss why we are HODL&#039;ing
Believe more gainz on the way!
&gt;When nocoiners tell me DGB is finished now
&gt;&gt;2267836Because we&#039;re brain dead retards holding a coin worth less than 250 sats that started as a pump and dump on 4chan then incredibly vague news released by the devs tricked people into thinking there was going to be minecraft integration and were now sitting on 10x gains for no fucking reasons and we hold a monopoly?
&gt;&gt;22679394D nocoiner shilling.DGB is primed for take off faggot.
&gt;&gt;2267956I&#039;ve been in since 172 sats. Don&#039;t pretend this is anything else all we have to do is not sell and it can never crash.

&gt;paying taxes for every altcoin transactionThis is a meme, right? RIGHT?
&gt;&gt;2267729Are you American? If so, not a meme.
&gt;&gt;2267734OP status: cucked
Every transaction made with bitcoin is taxable but you can also subtract losses. The easy way to do it is just calculate your total profit from the year and then calculate it from that amount according to your tax rate. So if you made 10k and your rate was 10% you would owe 1k. It&#039;s not that difficult.
&gt;&gt;2267758It&#039;s only that easy if you completely cash out before the end of every tax year.
&gt;&gt;2267729The IRS wants in on the crypto action. What better way to make money off memecoins than to drain all the traders.
&gt;&gt;2267766It doesn&#039;t matter if you &quot;cash out&quot; or not. Your tax is supposed to be calculated by the amount of capital gains you make during that year.
&gt;&gt;2267766Actually I take it back, it&#039;s not that easy even still. Taxes compound depending on how many exchanges it took to make that profit.
who dat slut
&gt;&gt;2267729I am not paying shit.
&gt;&gt;2267779Bullshit
&gt;&gt;2267784monroe
&gt;&gt;2267729The advice in these threads is so shit.Read THIShttps://money.stackexchange.com/questions/74789/do-altcoin-trades-count-as-like-kind-exchanges-deferred-capital-gains-tax&quot;So therefore by the IRS&#039; own guidance, you are trading property for property. Which in some cases is privy to like-kind treatment where capital gains tax events are no longer created upon liquidation into another like property until settled in a national currency.&quot;
&gt;&gt;2267778&gt;Hi there we have calculated that you have $200,000 worth of bitbeans therefore you owe us $30,000. Thanks! - IRSwut? How can something be considered capital gains if I haven&#039;t actually made any actual USD gains yet?!
&gt;&gt;2267807&gt;why should i have to pay taxesBecause it has value in USD. Call the IRS and ask them.
&gt;&gt;2267792Buy $100 BTCWait for it to reach $300 ($200 profit, taxed 15%)Exchange back to fiat (taxed 15%)$200 profit becomes $144. OrBuy $100 BTCExchange that to MEMECOINValue in MEMECOIN triples to $300 ($200 profit, taxed 15%)Exchange back to BTC (taxed 15%)Exchange back to fiat (taxed 15%)So your $200 profit is now $120.
It&#039;s simply imposible to report all altcoin trades. Consider that cryptsy, mintpal, and an endless sea of other exchanges disappeared and so did all the data. I can&#039;t give the IRS the data if it doesn&#039;t exist.
&gt;&gt;2267803I want this to be true so much.
&gt;&gt;2267817Technically most alt coins don&#039;t have value in USD because you can&#039;t trade them directly into USD.
&gt;&gt;2267839They have value in bitcoin and bitcoin has value in USD.&gt;&gt;2267819Not true. If you were a trader and making hundreds of trades a day you wouldn&#039;t even make any money. You only owe your tax rate on your capital gains at the end of the year.
The only exception is if you are holding long term.http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp
I live with my parents I dont know fucking anything about tax whatsoever, is the government going to steal my money?
&gt;&gt;2267873&gt;World of Warcraft gold also has value in USD. The IRS needs to sue Blizzard and all players for not declaring capital gains on their Auction House profits.&gt;Players questing has value in gold which has value in USD. Players have to declare capital gains on gold gained out of every quest to the IRS.
&gt;&gt;2267929That&#039;s pretty funny actually, I knew a guy who became a millionaire by goldselling in world of warcraftShows that the tax system is kinda retarded
&gt; not making the difference between a trade and a transaction.&gt; between a literal exchange of two objects and a fluctuation in monetary value that happens your bank account&gt; not realising that if TRADES were taxable high frequency trading,trading in penny stocks and other perfectly legal things in wall street would not existMY GOD you guys need to learn English
&gt;&gt;2267778I&#039;m a nocoiner but that&#039;s wrongcapital gains must be realized or they aren&#039;t declaredhow exactly do you think something becomes long term capital gains from short
&gt;&gt;2267873&gt;They have value in bitcoin and bitcoin has value in USD.Not how it works.If any of you people can actually provide a source on this, that would be great.According to everything I&#039;ve ever seen on the IRS taxation on cryptocurrency, altcoin transactions cannot be taxed unless it&#039;s something like ETH or LTC.Quit posting this meme unless you can back it up.
I see a lot of talk about taxes on here lately. I honestly don&#039;t know the answer for sure but, I don&#039;t see how the IRS could ever know what you made if you didn&#039;t cash out. And you don&#039;t pay taxes on an asset if it appreciates in value. I own a business that grows in value each year. If my business is worth 100k one year and 200k the next I&#039;m not taxed on the 100k increase. Don&#039;t see why holding a coin that goes up in value would be any different.I also work with metals. If I buy 100k worth of aluminum at the start of the year for $1 a lb. And the value of aluminum goes up to 1.50 a lb, I don&#039;t pay taxes on the 50k I gained unless I sell it for the increased price.
&gt;&gt;2267984&gt;I don&#039;t see how the IRS could ever know what you made if you didn&#039;t cash outThe moment you exchange USD for BTC through an exchange your trail starts. The IRS can see your public btc address and track to what altcoin exchange you are sending your btc and then request your entire trade history from that exchange.&gt;If my business is worth 100k one year and 200kWhat people here are arguing is that the IRS wants to tax not only coin to fiat trades but also coin to coin trades which is retarded and they can&#039;t actually enforce imo
Can we all just agree not to cash out and form a crypto economy and never pay taxes again.
&gt;&gt;2268083Yeah but if I never cash out I can&#039;t really use the money for shit I want to buy

I would say this what it feels like to pay for a girls college so she can start her own business and dump your ass for chad with no second notice.But usually, you can choose to forget about the girl. Instead, I will be hodling coin for eternity. Fuck you Digibytes and Digibyte chan. I hope a new coin comes along that i can trade all my DGB for.You are all idiots. I did not sell my DGB, i am holding over 2 million here.
&gt;&gt;2267114aren&#039;t we all?you must have considered selling something aswell when it dipped to almost half its worth
I am sorry biz. I guess i am just jealous of success. I will try to remain calm. How an embarrassing of meHope you grow big and strong Digibytes*takes deep breath*
&gt;&gt;2267519I&#039;m with you. I shilled DGB and made plenty of people invest into it only to sell it like a retard for mere 500 sats and not buying again because of saltiness. Anyway; Join SIA. It&#039;s the new meme.
you guys realize that launching a new coin these days is probably the best shot you&#039;ll ever have at getting rich right?so, any ideas for the next dogecoin-type coin?
4Coin
&gt;&gt;2267782Idk brah, doge, ltc, milo, trump, etc are all just stores of value with no application.Seems like you&#039;d have to make something with a little more substance at this stage.
&gt;&gt;2267786What if &quot;mining&quot; was shitposting on 4chan in the wallet?
Someone is going to make a shit ton of money launching BANE coin.
&gt;&gt;2267801&gt;doge, ltc, milo, trump, etc are all just stores of value with no application.sounds like you just described any other crypto also. anyway that&#039;s good enough. also doge recently hit ATH in $
&gt;&gt;2267830&gt;everytime it crashes&gt;they expect one of us in the wreckage brother&gt;everytime it pumps&gt;the fire rises
why dont we start a discord and come up with a plan to create a crypto?we can market it as a coin created by anonymousthe idea is strength in numbers so the good ideas/talent floats to the topwe could all become millionaires by the end of 2017
&gt;&gt;2267830transactions will not be called &#039;transactions&#039;, rather 4u&#039;s
&gt;&gt;2267860kek I like it. /tv/ can be duped into buying it while everyone else dumps.
&gt;&gt;2267867i&#039;m in. someone create a discord while i figure out what the hell discord is and how to use it
&gt;&gt;2267860But baneposting is getting a little old. We need new memes.
&gt;&gt;2267918Somebody get this hot head out of here!
&gt;&gt;2267867&gt;created by AnonymousAll the anarchist druggies and wannabe hackers would jump on board, then normies would because of the street cred. As long as it actually maintained anonymity in its transactions it would take off.Wish I knew the first thing about creating coins.
eth token for cloud AI
HashcoinYoung people spend half their income on weed.A currency for dispensaries and online pot shops, you can also cash out your hashcoins for real hashcoins that you can smoke. This will fight inflation.Banks could also be dispensaries.What do you think? Existing potcoins suck.
&gt;&gt;2268001yeah i agree. with a non-retarded name and some &quot;marketing&quot; and a bit of luck i could see it kinda take off.also i&#039;m sure i could figure out how to do create a coin. all we need is a clone, nothing innovative. the existing ones are open-source
&gt;&gt;2268033nah, not innovative enough
&gt;&gt;2268001C# programmer here with 10 yrs expRead Satoshi&#039;s papersCan make 4coin next stratis if do hard enoughWho&#039;s aboard the gravy train?
&gt;&gt;2268065but what would the coin do?
&gt;&gt;2268006&gt;&gt;2268039On to something....I think&#039;ve got it.Recaptcha is big and fucking sucks, and now we are creating our own doom by training AI cars. First try never works even if it&#039;s right, so i always try to mess up the second one and it works.How bout a recaptcha that uses an authenticator to automatically auth posts, You use some computing power to auth that gets used towards blocks/ mining.
&gt;&gt;2268065there&#039;s already something called 4coin. any other suggestions?
i have the next 50 million dollar market cap coin idea, but i couldnt code my way out of a paper bag. gonna try and find a dev on bitcointalk this summer though, easy fucking cash and its a really simple idea too.
&gt;&gt;2268078I will call this coin....DIO COIN
&gt;&gt;2268076Make money.What do you mean
&gt;&gt;2268120what&#039;s the value proposition
Buy Sia instead, its going to skyrocket like DGB soonPlus its not a memecoin, it actually has a real use case and Amazon has teamed up with them for using Enterprise servers
&gt;&gt;2268087Some suggestionsSlappyfrappsHucklechucksRewendweiners....Traskintors..........Samerath...................Kopoli........................SharpCoin..........but mostly hucklechucksI said I&#039;m a programmer not a name makerNext question please
&gt;&gt;2268132lel gonna need source on that
&gt;&gt;2268131Place names of altcoins on dartboardThrow dartsEmulate model with most hits, but c#Seems to be the answer
&gt;&gt;2268138&gt;I said I&#039;m a programmer not a name makerlol i can i believe that
&gt;&gt;2268179NEXT QUESTION PLEASE
&gt;&gt;2268087Sperg coin
refugee coin
&gt;&gt;2268196yeah which coin do we clone?
&gt;&gt;2268132I like this meme. Buying SIA right now.
TrapCoin, Code: TRAP, Symbol:
&gt;&gt;2268208Being serious,All the hype on stratis is warranted, and it could possibly be done better.So, suggest a way to do it better
SONICOINHEDGEHOG FUNDS?GOFAST BUX?
&gt;&gt;2268132Great meme. Just put 400 in
&gt;&gt;2268220yeah but not easy though. do we really need innovation?&gt;&gt;2268201&gt;&gt;2268205&gt;&gt;2268222i was gonna suggest lambocoin as a joke but it turns out it fucking exists
germination of an idea:why don&#039;t we combine our favourite things of making money with making money?step 1: create anon&#039;s dropship network offering really nice things at what seem to be cheap prices but actually massive mark ups from cheap chinese shit.step 2: market the shit out of dropship network to normies.step 3: introduce drop coin which allows you to buy things from dropship network FOR LESS THAN WHAT THEY COST IN USD.normies think they&#039;re getting a bargain but they&#039;re actually buying these coins off us at way more than we paid for them, then spending those coins on our dropship network to buy products which we make a massive profit from. We strike it rich in 2 different avenues.Who&#039;s with me?
&gt;&gt;2267782Start developing a promising ICO when Stratis launches the ICO functionality. With the .net framework and c# they are sucking up heavily to Microsoft. From a programmers standpoint this looks more interesting than ether.
I have %100 of money in cryptoNeed better allocationSuggestions (gold/stocks/etc)?
I&#039;ll start&gt;$SC&gt;$XVG
&gt;$SCFor sure
Golem is going to fucking CRASH... EVERYTHING.the memery is too strong with this one.
&gt;der colemGood thing i sold
&gt;&gt;2268185I really like the website this could definitely gain traction. The idea is there I just don&#039;t want to buy any though :)
who mirin?
Minereum to Bittrex when
&gt;Kek I&#039;m not lowering so come and grab me teeheeeThis fucking slut coin. I&#039;m sick with a horrible cold, I have exams to learn on, it&#039;s 90 degrees outside and this bitch is trying to make me play pat a cake with her.Bitcoin a slut, a sluuuuttt. I&#039;m going to make buttcoin pay for the dinner and the entire apartment I&#039;ll fuck her in. And you know what else? She&#039;s going on top and doing all the work for me.
This is what happens when you don&#039;t buy the dip.
Accurate. Good thing I&#039;m holdin&#039; her
&gt;&gt;2267865Yeah it&#039;s up $200 and it&#039;s not going down again. Better buy now goy.
Seriously though, is it still good to buy in? Kinda nervous after I&#039;ve fucked up one of my BTC investments.
&gt;&gt;2268206Probably not desu. It&#039;s not stable at this price and it looks likely to crash again soon.
&gt;&gt;2268215Yeah, I thought so... although the order book shows (at least on Kraken) that there is quite a bit more demand than supply.
&gt;&gt;2268118Your goat is next, Ahmed.
How do I get into&gt;CryptocurrencyI live in NY, and can&#039;t seem to find any good exchanges where I can have meme coins. Poloniex denied me outright. Fucking bitliscence crap.Please show me the way /biz/ I have a ton of funds from day trading penny stocks to invest into this
&gt;&gt;2267800NY also, bittrex
Buy Bitcoins at a premium from localbitcoins. Not much else is available to you if you&#039;re in NY, from what I hear.Once you have your BTC, start trading.

&gt;Sells when it isnt even mooning properly yetYes you did.
&gt;&gt;2266899120% gains sound fine to me. It&#039;s probably going to dip with all the big wallet holders selling before mooning again.
you can always buy back in for more right now
&gt;&gt;2266913&gt;&gt;2266908I was planning to rebuywhats a good aim to target?1200 sat? less?

&gt;doing wrongYou just made +100% 24h gains, not bad for a beginner ;)
&gt;&gt;2268037Everything is manual.You have to change the qty yourself, but for keeping track of what you are holding, its good.
&gt;&gt;2268037you use blockfolio instead of pen and paper.
Yeah, the day chart is fucking retarded. My total value is 23$, but in day chart it says $4.
Stop daytrading.

Bitcoin is not at an ath, yet my portfolio is
&gt;&gt;2265959this isn&#039;t good advice at all

Technical Analysis is great.Whenever you encounter someone who uses it unironically, you immediately know to ignore their advice.
&gt;&gt;2267769Right. Merely memelines are legit
&gt;thinking the fundamentals matter
yeah, that&#039;s probably why algos rarely make moneywait...
&gt;&gt;2267840High frequency/algo trading is not based on TA at all. It&#039;s usually 1. substantially more complicated than that and 2. taking into an account a massive amount of variables in a statistical sense (where things are trading relative to their average daily range, relative to other securities, relative to other correlated securities, whether or not those correlations have momentarily broken down, etc etc etc etc).A standard algo trade would be regression to the mean in different parts of the treasury yield curve as it reacts to news and reprices itself, things like that.
&gt;&gt;2267852all those thing you mentioned fall under technical analysis, dipshitmost big players on Forex and future markets operate with a mix of stochastic analysis, price action and, of course, news.
&gt;&gt;2267769Took me years to figure this out.
This video has made me withdraw all my profits made with ETH and put them into STRATIShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Byfn_k2qUAnd BTW I always hated Vitalik, fuck that cunt.
&gt;&gt;2266743I was going to invest in stratis last week but I couldnt be bothered with the hassle of buying bitcion in the uk. kill me
&gt;&gt;2266761Just buy some senpai
&gt;&gt;2266743&gt;And BTW I always hated Vitalik, fuck that cunt.^weaselGoing to buy some, next week. Looks good anon.

Will it be too late to buy after the 10th?I want to hold my DGB until, then sell for Stratis.
&gt;&gt;2267498In the same boat brother, waking up and seeing the 400 bucks put in dgb turn into 7k is amazing
&gt;&gt;2266743&gt;dramatic music for emotional manipulationCTRL+W
Hey anon,How is my crypto portfolio? I am planning to stop investing once I hit $10K USD, should be done by the end of June. Which other coins should I purchase? Thanks!
