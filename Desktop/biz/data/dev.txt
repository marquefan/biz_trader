Reminder you will die from stress before you hit 30 if you continue this crypto trading shit.
Stress? I don&#039;t give a fuck, more than double what I put into XBY in a day. Why the fuck would I stress?
&gt;&gt;2260559That&#039;s why I buy and hold
&gt;&gt;2260559You&#039;re not wrong but it&#039;s mostly because of arguing with my wife.I&#039;m 22 and my hair is literally turning silvery-grey. My wife notices it, I see it every time in the mirror, it&#039;s like my father&#039;s hair when he turned 55.
&gt;&gt;2260559Just because I watch the market for 20 hours a day doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m gonna die. Right guys?
&gt;&gt;2260584Don&#039;t get married at 22 then you fucking idiot.
&gt;&gt;2260559Crypto &quot;trading&quot; is for anxiety ridden ADHD goyim.The true meditative masters of earthly wealth know that patience is all you need for success in life.Buy, hold, and profit.I check my gains once in a while but if you think we are all out here trying to ride peaks and valleys then you are very wrong.
&gt;&gt;2260559&gt;tfw turning 30 this year and in this situation
&gt;&gt;2260559No because I am not sissy faggot like you

&gt;&gt;2260584&gt;22 and marriedholy shit
&gt;&gt;2260559I find trading relaxing.I like to meditate while I wait for trading opportunities.
&gt;&gt;2260601&gt;Crypto &quot;trading&quot; is for anxiety ridden ADHD goyim.i&#039;ve finally found my niche.
&gt;&gt;2260622bitch must suck his dick daily.Cant see why else he would be married.

i luv you OP
Actual no joke.
&gt;&gt;2260591&gt;BlitzCashToo expensive now
&gt;&gt;2260591So, buy Blitzcash?
&gt;&gt;2260659Reeee that&#039;s what I said about BLOCK I&#039;m getting in this shit FUCK OP for not posting this yesterday
Who here wants some DOGE? First 20 people to post a picture of your doge with a &quot;sup /biz/?&quot; sign each get 100 DOGE. If your doggo is a shibu innu, you get 300 DOGE. Wow. Much opportunity.
It&#039;s me. I&#039;ve been thinking about the BAT situation. The way I see it, there are two ways this can go. Lets do some simple math...Half of this now ~180M market cap is owned by 4 guys and they can&#039;t dump anywhere - market cap is effectively cut in half to ~80M with ~190 random guys holding it.effectively each guy on that half we could say is holding about $500,000. This would be incredibly hard to dump anywhere, even for just one of them. That&#039;s what, 200 BTC not accounting for the price lowering from dumping, still a huge volume from ONE of these shit heads.This leads to a scenario where the price right now is the actual price from the whales locking it out and the original ICO prices and market cap calculations and predictions are in effect totally nullified and buying right now would not mean very much. The problem with this is that the market cap would, you could say, be ~160M at ICO, a terrible start, 10x needs a 1.6 BILLION DOLLAR market cap. 100x on 160M in the current crypto market, consider that a pipe dream... so that is a flaw to this possible scenario.But, this also means that if a single one of these 200 guys decides to cash out, most likely on a popular exchange where it would have the users and volume to be able to dump 200+ BTC, the price is tanking to probably just about ICO, maybe 2x. This is the other scenario.What do my anons think of this? I&#039;ve been following BAT and making threads on it for months now and I want opinions on what I&#039;m saying here from other smartanons. This is what I think the landscape is.no shitposters, retards asking easily googled questions etc etc.. you will be hidden. definitely not here to play daddy and spoonfeed you noobie information.
Ok, let&#039;s face it... ETH is a shitty coin which only promises of future uses. Lot&#039;s of companies are investing in this meme but yet no one has been able to find a use for it.The only thing ETH has shown potential for is to create ICO&#039;s which is the dot com bubble 2.0My advice is, press S to spit on grave and get off the failing coin now that you still can.You&#039;ve been vitalik&#039;d.
&gt;&gt;2260262I agree OP. I too wish to keep the price down until my next paycheck clears.
&gt;&gt;2260262&gt;nobody has been able to find a use for it&gt;new companies forming on it literally every month&gt;It&#039;s used for trading almost as much as bitcoin, which is shitETH should have a far, far higher marke cap than BTC. Fuck off with your idiotic shit.
Where is the serious analysis?
feels bretty gud that nocoiners are starting to get salty over ETH as well
&gt;&gt;2260270Oh yeah, you can use it for &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;SMART CONTRACTS&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; which is the new name for PROGRAMMING.Inside a vending machine you have a smart contract, you enter a dime and you get a coke. WOW! A smart contract... yet nobody has thought something that cannot be done with an oracle database in a cheapper way than with this ether/gas/blablablah shitty thing. Be real... price is OVERVALUATED.
ETH is due for a correction, wait for that before spurting doom and gloom for maximum impact.
&gt;&gt;2260289Oh and i forgot:S
&gt;&gt;2260301&gt;ETH is due for a correctionevery time
&gt;&gt;2260289ETH is still worth thousands of times more than Bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2260289&gt;the code running on a coke machine is also running on the coins that come out for changehahayou&#039;re not very bright are you
&gt;&gt;2260270&gt;has a huge attack surface due to Turing completeness&gt;companies will be using their own private blockchains
&gt;&gt;2260262You call that post a &quot;serious analysis on ETH fundamentals?&quot;Bahahahaha. 3/10 only because I lold.
Eth has won the blockchain game. Pack your little shitcoin bags up and get the fuck out
&gt;he thinks current gen cryptos are the future&gt;he thinks ETH won&#039;t moon&gt;he thinks big companies take this shit seriously
&gt;&gt;2260262Damn man, it feels great to be balls deep in pre-pump ETH. You must be either a coping shitcoiner or, even worse, a filthy nocoiner.
no companies are investing in ethereum, that would be fucking insane. theyre all experimenting with smart contracts of which ethereum is the largest platform of. none are going to use the public chain to run code on, and none are going to invest heavily in ethereum just to pay for the privilege to run their contracts on the public chain with all of its availability and stability issues.ico&#039;s are just altcoins within an altcoin, more pump and dump potential and at the end of the day thanks to exchanges theyre treated as their own coin as no end user ever sees them on the ethereum blockchain, just as a balance in their exchange.&gt;&gt;2260312just because something is more complicated that something else doesn&#039;t make it worth that many times more. by that logic there are coins that are worth 10x whatever ethereum is worth.
&gt;&gt;2260359&gt;wont moon&gt;&gt;2260398&gt;pre-pumppoe&#039;s law at its finest.
I don&#039;t trust ETH since the DAO hack &amp; fork.Turing completeness means we&#039;ll eventually see another hack, imo. Not a good store of value.
&gt;&gt;2260402&gt;none are going to use the public chain to run code onhttps://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorumYou do realize that public blockchains are what makes crypto so secure and immutable?
&gt;&gt;2260289&gt;nobody has thought something that cannot be done with an oracle database in a cheapper way than with this ether/gas/blablablah shitty thing.Decentralized drug market is the only application
&gt;&gt;2260420&gt;we&#039;ll eventually see anotherTHIS.
&gt;&gt;2260262http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-smart-contract-exchange-14-million/Eth is just going to experience hack after hack. Security problem after security problem.
&gt;&gt;2260433or anything else where you want to keep identities secret, i.e. just about everythingwhy should someone know that I bought a coke from a coke machine or why should the FDIC be able to see my intra-institutional transactions?
&gt;&gt;2260442&gt;&gt;2260420because the first hack totally destroyed it, right?You fork and move on.Next time I would probably not reverse the transactions but to be fair the delay was built into the contract for that very purpose.
&gt;&gt;2260454&gt;why should someone know that I bought a coke from a coke machineWhy does it matter?&gt;why should the FDIC be able to see my intra-institutional transactions?Why would you use ETH instead of btc or monero?
&gt;&gt;2260426&gt;secure and immutabledidn&#039;t work out for ethereum though, and another exchange fucked up and threw away 14 million in ether yesterday too. public blockchains are useful for passing value around in a decentralized way, most of the &quot;apps&quot; built on ethereum either move tokens around or require outside information or interaction, or worse promises from another centralized company that needs to be upheld. theres few decentralized applications being built that arent just another abstraction layer around value tokens.the smaller &quot;startup&quot; companies will develop things for the public chain, but thats just so they can get ico money on the promise that whatever theyre building will make money for ico holders, accumulating eth they need to dump in the process.
&gt;&gt;2260462&gt;Haha it&#039;s OK if we get hacked! it will inevitably recoverMaybe that shit slid when Eth was still a baby but why do you think people would let them get away with it again?
You put the MO in FOMO anon. Get back to that there cash register at Sbarro&#039;s and quit the sage
&gt;&gt;2260462It absolutely tanked the price for months.Imagine right now if news got out that Bitcoin got hacked, all the normies invested will lose their shit and the price would absolutely plummet.That&#039;s what will most likely happen to ETH at some point.You&#039;ve got to ask youself if the potential gains outweight the risks.
&gt;&gt;2260402Bitcoin is shit. It has no redeeming qualities. ETH isn&#039;t. Not more complicated, just better. What&#039;s complicated is why any moron would choose to dump money into BTC at all when ETH is just a step away now.
&gt;&gt;2260321desu, the huge attack surface worries me, but eventually someone was going to come up with this idea.At least the Ethereum devs seem serious and committed.
&gt;&gt;2260466&gt;Why does it matter?Because the whole world doesn&#039;t need to see what I&#039;m buying. I know that&#039;s the shitty world we live in right now but it doesn&#039;t have to be that way. We can start with Coca-cola but we can extrapolate to all sorts of shit, like pink dildos and expensive dinners with my mistress.&gt;Why would you use ETH instead of btc or monero?see&gt;&gt;2260426&gt;&gt;2260467&gt;another exchange fucked up and threw away 14 million in ether yesterday toohas nothing to do with the ethereum technologythat exchange literally fucked up on every security level&gt;public facing root&gt;password authentication&gt;no white or blacklisting IP rangesMy shitposting laptop is better secured than that exchange was.&gt;&gt;2260467&gt;the smaller &quot;startup&quot; companies will develop things for the public chainSilicon valley is doing just fine and it&#039;s like 98% shitty startups. It&#039;s held together by the Fortune 500 companies, just like Ethereum alliance.&gt;&gt;2260481&gt;hackedIt wasn&#039;t hacked. It was fair game and everyone holding ETC believed as much. Regardless, going forward it&#039;s best to fix and fork.&gt;&gt;2260481&gt;why should I have to install windows updates? why isn&#039;t windows secure now and forever? windows will never succeed with this model.&gt;&gt;2260516yeah it tanked because there was a hard fork. That only matters if you are trying to get rich off investing in ether. It doesn&#039;t affect the underlying technology at all though if the price goes down.
&gt;&gt;2260525It&#039;s hard for people with autism to understand what gives Bitcoin it&#039;s value.In your mind &quot;Faster! Better tech! More features!&quot; should equal more value, like when you&#039;re shopping for a smartphone.But what is giving Bitcoin it&#039;s $2500 price tag isn&#039;t cutting edge tech, it&#039;s tried and tested tech.Bitcoin has been around and strong for almost a decade and experienced no security problems, it&#039;s starting to feel like something that&#039;s somewhat safe and reliable, that&#039;s why normies are really starting to warm up to it.
&gt;&gt;2260567in the end I think both will succeedBitcoin as a sort of a pseudo-gold standard for wealth storage and a ledger for second-layer payment mechanisms and ethereum for widespread blockchain technology adoption
&gt;&gt;2260525bitcoin isn&#039;t &quot;shit&quot;, and if thats your investment DD then you&#039;ve got a long way to go in this space. doing more without a reason to do so isn&#039;t useful, this is how software like windows ended up in the mess it&#039;s in. piling bugfixes or consensus exceptions for bailouts on top of an already poor performing vm isn&#039;t going to make this platform very stable in the future, unless it barely changes. complete rewrites are already off the table, thats what a competing ethereum &quot;2.0&quot; currency would be for.and again, there&#039;s yet to be anything built on ethereum that&#039;s truly decentralized whilst also being more useful being on a blockchain like ethereum that isn&#039;t just an abstraction or layer above transfering value. and you can do this without the useless tokens, they&#039;re just there to make the creators of the tokens rich, that&#039;s all.&gt;&gt;2260547it has everything to do with the technology when there&#039;s a much larger attack surface and an order of magnitude more way to fuck up when using it.the &quot;startups&quot; with their ico pump and dumps are whats causing this huge alt/eth bubble. the ethereum alliance is nothing more than a bunch of teams within companies exploring the smart contract space. if you think that means theyre going to be dumping money into ether tokens or moving their core infrastructure to an unstable public blockchain you&#039;re sorely mistaken.
&gt;&gt;2260567&gt;Bitcoin has been around and strong for almost a decadeFeel old yet?
&gt;&gt;2260262sell all your ETH now!it&#039;s only going to dump in Junescreencap this
Re: security, I heard they&#039;re working on higher level languages that compile to solidity, and also something about correctness verification. These problems are not intractable.
&gt;&gt;2260616&gt;and you can do this without the useless tokenshow do you incentives nodes then?
&gt;&gt;2260612the bigger picture is bitcoin has a whole load of technical issues that stem from one issue: adoption. no other alt is going to be able to sidestep these issues when they come up against them, at some point youre going to have to make the decision to store some transaction off the blockchain or you&#039;re going to end up with a system thats impossible to run in a decentralized manner.and all of this doesnt even matter because right now the alt bubble is warping the perceived value of each of these blockchain projects, because people assume price = worth when it&#039;s all down to moonchasers and speculators with a few snake oil salesmen trying to lure them over to their corner.

I made some bad investments... i need help.I have someone at Lehman brothers $250,000 of my grand parents life insurance policy back before the economy tanked and the stock i bought in coca cola and isnt turning a profit... i only have $5 grand in return from my initial investment back in 2009.What do I do?
&gt;&gt;2260075Wow. That about sums up the thread. OP just work with this guy. He&#039;s right.
&gt;&gt;2260075can vouch for this guy, do what he says
&gt;&gt;2260053Cash out your 255k.Let this be a lesson to put your money in broad low coast index funds.If you had just bought an S&amp;P500 ETF with that money in 2009 you wouldve turned 250k into over 750k right now.If you want to be safe put 70% in VOO (vanguard s&amp;p 500 etf) and 30% in BND (aggregate bond).this combo has done about 15% per year or more for the last 8 years, and is incredibly diversified with over 500 companies (stocks), and thousands of coprorate and govt bonds
&gt;&gt;2260185You sound like a union scab. I dont beleive you
&gt;&gt;2260185You could&#039;ve even put 20k - 50k into crypto just for fun
&gt; get into finance department in one of the biggest petrochemistry companies&gt; have to do absolutely nothing. Maybe work 20% of the time&gt; hate my job with a passionwhat do? I hate it but pay is extremely good and additional experience looks very good on resume. I&#039;ve only been here for 4 months

&gt;&gt;2260460this:&gt;&gt;2260465i should study for exams and all i did today was 12h shitposting and coin daytrading.im in since one week and made already 3,5k out of 3k at the beginning.next week 5k confirmed.
&gt;&gt;2260392Similar boat here. The company I worked at got bought. I avoided the layoffs at my company, but 70% of my responce abilities have been shifted to other department. I don&#039;t think anyone has noticed I have nothing to do 70% of each day. Bored out of my mind just staring at my phone prentendimg to be busy...... what do?
&gt;&gt;2260497&gt;&gt;2260465&gt;&gt;2260521I don&#039;t know how to do it and frankly I don&#039;t want to. I&#039;m shit with technology tbqh
&gt;&gt;2260534&gt;I don&#039;t think anyone has noticed I have nothing to do[Pajeet anus twitch intensifies]
&gt;&gt;2260545Are you 70? WTF....
&gt;&gt;2260534You either need to be more active in your company looking for work (not passively waiting for assignments to come to you but asking around for what needs help) or look for a new job now. I&#039;m sure they notice and the second profits slip you&#039;ll be fired.

&gt;&gt;2258816dont day trade
Selling this shitcoin now, thanks for the gainsEven if it continues to go up some, I don&#039;t care. If we&#039;re all completely honest, this is not the coin of the future, just another generic pets.com of the blockchain boom to be consigned to the history books
&gt;&gt;2258934Agreed. Some great marketing behind though. Shills are really pumping it around here.
&gt;&gt;2258934I hope you get enough money to buy a gun and kys when this goes up to 10000 sat
&gt;&gt;2258934enjoy the gainsbuy back in when it dips
&gt;&gt;2258560The same @300@600@900@1200Next crash @1500, amirite?
It already dipped under 1200 before.Chances are it&#039;ll normalize around 1100 and then spike back up.
&gt;&gt;2258934Even if it literally sits at 1000 sats forever, I will still have made 100x on it by the end of the year when bitcoin is at $10,000. It&#039;s impossible to lose.
&gt;&gt;2258988&gt;It&#039;s impossible to loseBut why would it sit at 1000 sats forever? Chances are it&#039;s going to zero at some point - the question is whether there is still room to make gains between then and now. There&#039;s a good chance it will continue to pump but there&#039;s nothing special about this coin - no backing, no unique features, no innovative technology. It&#039;s just another generic shitcoin, just like pets.com was another generic website in the dot com boom.Whether or not DGB hits 2000 sats or 3000 or whatever before zero, who knows? There is money to be made on speculation but as far as I&#039;m concerned digibyte has already pumped.I&#039;m prepared to be wrong, but for me this is not a long term hold. I&#039;m taking my gains now while I can
&gt;&gt;2259031This is terrible fudding.No backing yet you ignore the whales that have hundreds of thousands in this coin as we speak.Why would they let it crash without profiting as much as they possibly could?If it was to go to zero than it would already have done that.
&gt;&gt;2259031&gt;Chances are it&#039;s going to zeroPlease show me an example of this ever having in crypto.
&gt;&gt;2259059*happening
&gt;&gt;2259059Not the guy but it has happened before, but lol there&#039;s just as much chance of this happening to sia, steem, etc, waves, and others at this point.Fudders still exist surprisingly.
&gt;&gt;2259047I&#039;m really not FUDding. In fact, I still hold half my DGBBut the fact that there are a bunch of whales with big holdings in DGB is not evidence that it&#039;s a good investment. When I said backing I meant like how ETH has the enterprise alliance, or how Ripple has big banks behind it.You may well be right that there are still gains to be made. When I say it&#039;s going to zero I mean over the course of a decade or so - and this is true of probably 90% of cryptos. Blockchainis definitely the future. But just as people investing in pets.com were correct that the internet was the future, they were wrong in thinking that this meant pets.com was going to be a part of this future. Only a few survived - Amazon, Google, Paypal etc. - and I don&#039;t think digibyte is going to be one of these survivors.I&#039;m still willing to speculate on shitcoins with no future though, but DGB is too hot for me right now&gt;&gt;2259059You&#039;re joking right?

What an awesome day
&gt;&gt;2259542YaaaaaaaawnTry again when it&#039;s Stratis levels
&gt;&gt;2258560LOL no.This is going to a dollar my friend.
&gt;&gt;2259312&gt;but just tried to find it, and came across this web page&gt;http://www.digibyte.co/about-digibyte&gt;for fucks sake please tell me this isn&#039;t the real websiteThis. The &quot;do your research&quot; meme led me to look into digibyte a while ago and it was pretty apparent right away that it was a joke and all the rumors of adoption and promise were either made up or highly exaggerated.Of course, it&#039;s only mooned since then, several times, which is just more proof that doing research doesnt mean shit, since people only buy a crypto because they think other people are buying the same crypto.also, idea for mods: consider making &quot;SELL SELL SELL&quot; a bannable term.
&gt;&gt;2259673Aaaaah someone got burned and is mad.Don&#039;t bring us down just because you fucked up.
&gt;&gt;2259723i only made money from dgb, but ill never put a lot into it because it&#039;s a scam, and of course it&#039;ll be worth shit eventually. hopefully youll have something left by then.
&gt;&gt;2258934This guy gets it. Smart money knows when to enter AND exit.
&gt;&gt;2259738What part of DGB is a scam
I ain&#039;t selling shit. I&#039;m holding and getting my daily 50% gains
&gt;&gt;2259770The part where it&#039;s completely dependant on videogames autists
&gt;&gt;2259673&gt;this???you&#039;re seriously thising some retard bitching about the webpage instead of the buisness model and future developement plan?are you fucking serious?do you think bit coin got big because of a flashy webpage?jesus christ just leave it&#039;s too sad to read your stupidity
&gt;&gt;2259770The part where it serves no practical purpose. It is pure meme
eat shit faggots serious gains incoming
&gt;&gt;2259779This comment proofs, that you have no idea regarding DGB.4chan is only spitting GAMING GAMING.Gaming is far away from the core purpose of DGB.
&gt;&gt;2259797nah dude that&#039;s clearly gonna end in losses my meme triangles told meget out while you can SELL SELL SELL
&gt;&gt;2258934&gt;&gt;2259761Wow, what a couple of tards. Contrary to your autistic belief, DGB is one of the only coins that will survive into the future.1) It&#039;s a usable currency2) It has a target and viable market3) It&#039;s marketed well and has strong leadership4) IT&#039;S A USABLE CURRENCY, PEOPLE DON&#039;T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT GOLEM SUPER COMPUTERS, THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUY STUFFThings like BAT, GNT, SC, etc are all interesting ideas, but they are literally pipe dreams and not applicable to this decade or the next. Their founders fundamentally do not understand the tech sector and commercial sectors that would even be remotely interested in their coin tech...Think about it, military, film production, VFX, video games... are these people going to use Golem&#039;s shitty public network for their computing? No, they all make enough to do everything in house and they like it that way.And you, are you really doing anything your macbook pro or alienware pc can&#039;t fucking handle? Shit like GNT and BAT will inevitably failThe only coins that matter right now are-BTC, ETH, DGB, XRP, and Bancor (which will kill waves and strat instantly)These 5 coins are irreplaceable and all have dominated their niche.Fucking idiots.
&gt;&gt;2259797https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhG9zWUGbs
&gt;&gt;2259828&gt;implying the worth of the coin is strictly bindet to the buyers price&gt;implying people can&#039;t sell for lessyeah i don&#039;t know if you understand how this whole thing works buddy
&gt;&gt;2258560The same threads were posted when it was at 900 sat and dropped to 400-500. We&#039;re at over 1000 sat now. Don&#039;t listen to these damn FUDs.
&gt;&gt;2259851I&#039;m implying that this is being pumped by some discord group somewhere, which you are probably a part of, by buying very small amounts of DGB multiple times to give the appearance of organic growth. The group that&#039;s part of this is going to pull their buy orders when they want to crash the coin and it&#039;s going to fly creaming through the floor of their intial buy price where they&#039;ll vacuum up all the cheap coins that become available.
&gt;&gt;2259813&gt;&quot;look mamy im spamming my pasta again&quot;
&gt;&gt;2259828&gt;&gt;2259877&gt;discord grouplolCome on newfag, are those the sorts of people putting millions into this coin?
&gt;&gt;2259877could you repeat that?i couldn&#039;t hear you over my serious gains
&gt;&gt;2259779&gt;Esport is fucking huge and will continue to grow.&gt;Tournament cash pools are in the millions, increasing every year and every day more people become competitive gamers to hit it big.You are an idiot, lol
&gt;&gt;2259921eSports are huge... ESPN broadcasts them during big competition. So, hes not an idiot.
Sure is, I bought it and it is already 11.71% up.
&gt;&gt;2259673Yeah, one day I decided to check things out, the coin is a jokeConstant issues with payout, constant issues with the wallet, virtually no chance of winning the Citibank cutest, the minecraft thing has already been delayed since October and I doubt will be working when they say. They also couldn&#039;t even find advertisers for their site, which is what led to the pay out problem, if they can&#039;t even get some advertisers I can&#039;t imagine how they&#039;re going to get big companies and stuff on board. And lastly the big and generous assumption that it will catch on in the &quot;gamer&quot; market.&gt;&quot;For those complaining about the site please note we paid out millions of DigiBytes in 2016 and early 2017 to gamers. This was all out of our own pocket to help spread the word about DigiByte. This is obviously not a sustainable model for anyone, especially at current prices. The site was completely free. We initially planned on having advertisers foot the bill for the DGB paid out but we were not able to bring any advertisers on board in time.&quot;So organized and professionalBut the crypto market doesn&#039;t run on facts or critical thinking so all of that is kinda moot, and it&#039;s so long as there continues to be hype and speculation, it will continue to rise. But when the hype dies and the speculations don&#039;t come to pass, there&#039;ll be nothing to keep it afloat.
&gt;&gt;2259895&gt;&gt;2259909
&gt;&gt;2259957I bought 25k at 650 sats and another 18k at exactly 1125 sats.Did I get trolled?
&gt;&gt;2259975If you hold, no. If you&#039;re a day trader, you&#039;re in for a roller coaster ride.
&gt;&gt;2259957Wow dude you sure showed me with that image you keep posting
&gt;&gt;2259934&gt; Constant issues with payoutDid you follow it why or are you just repeating shit on 4chan?&gt; no chance of winning the Citibank cutestThey don&#039;t have to win.Promoting and networking is more than enough.Deals are made later. Out of 1200 they got at least into the finals.&gt;delayed since OctoberRelease is 10 of JuneAlso, the minecraft thing is a COMMUNITY PROJECT BY SOME DUDES WHO ARE NOT OFFICIAL DEVS!Stop posting from a new proxy everytime.
&gt;&gt;2259988Nigga, I&#039;m trying to inform other anons about the nature of these events. Traditionally, you don&#039;t eat your own, but there are a shit ton of shill groups that are preying on fellow /biz/nessmen and it&#039;s unacceptable. If an anon is going to buy above this point with their measly $100 or eurp or whatever, they will be subject to these whales trying to shake them out. Strong Hands is a good meme, but it needs to be backed up with information, which is what I&#039;m providing. Call me a FUD&#039;er, but I don&#039;t want other anons losing money.
&gt;&gt;2260018I&#039;m in support of that then.You just need to specify more instead of post a picture.I&#039;m not shilling for DGB, I put in a couple hundred when it was very low and I&#039;ve held up to here.It&#039;s going places if you hold long term. I&#039;ve never sold at a loss and look and where I am now.
&gt;&gt;2259957yeah dude im totally getting trolled once i dump my bags on the tardsim such a retard to take advantage of the situation
&gt;&gt;2260035You do you. I&#039;m going to do my best to make sure that people don&#039;t panic buy or sell. I&#039;ve made my case on several dips and crests, so I&#039;m trying to help other anons out.
&gt;&gt;2260051if they still don&#039;t understand what a pump and dump is than they have to lose all theire money to understand the situationyou can&#039;t babysit &#039;em theire whole life in fear they might do something wrongliterly my first 4 days on the trade and made about 80% in returnsfuck them if they don&#039;t understand it
the people fudding only talk about how mine-camf is a scam.it&#039;s almost like they sold way early and now carry sad bags of salt and refuse to research further.pecans are popping over here.
&gt;&gt;2259957let the records show that dgb originally got posted here when it was just under 100 sats, most biz regulars would have bought in at under 250 sats, and we are up so GOD DAMN MUCH at this point that your FUD over a 10% dip means less than nothing. a 50% dip would mean less than nothing. we will be here until death or $1+.
&gt;&gt;2259059TacocoinMugatucoinFlappycoinLitecoindarkDogecoindarkShibecointhere are TONS of cryptos that have gone to 0, those are a few that popped to mind without researching
&gt;&gt;2259377People have literally been talking that shit for months now.LTC is going nowhere.
&gt;&gt;2259059Coinmarketcap historical dataPick 2013 and see how many coins you know
&gt;&gt;22602271 small correction. it was under 50sats
&gt;&gt;2260018Thanks, bro. By any chance were you the dude who wrote the guide? I had a good time reading that.
&gt;&gt;2260253You&#039;re arguing with people who didn&#039;t know anything other than bitcoin existed until a couple of months ago, and had probably never even opened /biz/ till then either.People are completely ignorant to the history of altcoins on here.
Is Ripple a good long term investment to put my earnings into or should I just shift them into BTC/ETH?Making decent money off DGB.
&gt;&gt;2259928Read again, goy
you should have sold all DGB by nowit will go down now slowly but steadydon&#039;t let the small increases worrie youyou won&#039;t miss shit just stay calm and wait for the dip to unfoldprobably 1220ish area
&gt;&gt;2258816Don&#039;t do that, I used to try that a lot and although it pays off sometimes, it&#039;s really a gamble and will fail many times, not to mention making you extremely stressed.
&gt;&gt;2260464nah bro. We are going to $1.
Moon just managed to get added on c-cex exchange!https://c-cex.com/?id=vote&amp;coin=moon &lt;&lt;PROOFMooncoin just activated Segwit&quot;Edit: the Mooncoin developer barrysty1e reported that he completed Segwit implementation.Now working on a difficulty readjustment algo.&quot;Mooncoin is about to launch, next stop. The moon.Hate if you want to hate but don&#039;t say you were not warned. Just like Digibyte you were warned.
&gt;&gt;2256920
&gt;&gt;2256930Yeah. Go ahead and bitch about it.New developer, new community, new goals. It&#039;s cheap enough so get in while its good.
A couple dollars won&#039;t hurt. Meh
&gt;&gt;2256939are you that mooncoin bagholder that was jelly he didnt sell them for dgb?
&gt;&gt;2257017&gt;tfw when I&#039;ve got 1sat moonbags AND 110sat DGB bagsAre you salty because you&#039;re slow?
MOONMEN ASSEMBLE
BUY NOW BUY NOW BUY NOWHoly shit, as soon as it gets listed the demand will skyrocket. Expect it to reach atleast 15 sats in a day. Plus it&#039;ll be on bittrex soon.
&gt;&gt;2256920Oh what the fuck is this?I got into it for the lulz, but will it now really rise?
&gt;&gt;2257196I think so. I got in just in case. Seems like theyvare really working to get it going damn.Never would&#039;ve thought it would get listed.
&gt;&gt;2257370The listing was bought. But nevertheless, I don&#039;t give a fuck about 1 sat. No matter if it a pure shilling, as long as my portfolio&#039;s worth increases, I am happy
I sold off 100 million at 1sat a couple hours ago because I was getting impatient and listening to too many naysayers. But its true I did want to pull some out and put it on XBY which was good before it broke 1000. I hope what OP says is true about a real launch -- with that in mind I just took down my sell walls on Bleu. Fire this ship up.
&gt;&gt;2257395Bought or not. At least it showd then some people are interested. It could&#039;ve been juat one person but hmm seems unlikely.Its not like you would receive anything back from voting.
&gt;&gt;2257526&gt;Its not like you would receive anything back from voting.Isn&#039;t the whole point just to raise the price of your bags?
&gt;&gt;2257490Fool. Mooncoin is going to 400 SATs. I&#039;ve been telling everyone this for weeks but you faggots are full of fear.
&gt;&gt;2257532Well, I meant directly?It could go either way. I wouldn&#039;t put up almost 2 bitcoins to hope the price of this goes up myself alone. Inwould AID a group of people to achieve this tho. So it probably means theres interest out there from the community.
&gt;&gt;2256920NO NO NONO MOON KEK COIN, NO BLAST OFF, NOTHIS ISN&#039;T GOING TO THE MOON, THE ROCKETS HAVE HAD ENGINE FAILURESTAYING HERE ON EARTH
&gt;&gt;2256920lmao we did it reddit
Here is their Dev talking about segwit process just now-https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1733963.1320
&gt;&gt;2257624Its not like I didnt keep a few hundred mil more, relax clown and keep it positive please and thank you.
&gt;&gt;2257739Share the wealth...
&gt;&gt;2256920which one of you bagholders payed 2500usd to get this thing listed?
Someone just bought 2btc worth on nova
&gt;&gt;2258373Damn 2.5btc.Going to need mlre than that for that massive sellwall tho.
&gt;&gt;2256920Why is this coin shilled so hard, what&#039;s so special about it?
&gt;&gt;2258751Many users on here have been scammed investing in this shitcoin at 2 Satoshi+.Now they sit on a shitcoin and can only sell low.
&gt;&gt;2258807Brah, I bought in at 1sat. I&#039;m shilling this shit for potential 5x-10x.Already sold my risk at 3sat.I pity any fool that buys in at more than 2sat tho. That&#039;s dumb as fuck.
&gt;&gt;2258837Then you are trying to scam people to buy your shitcoin bag. Nobody but starter holders will gain money from this.
&gt;&gt;2258852You *can* technically set a buy at 1sat. It would take a full week or more to fill, but I don&#039;t see the coin taking off too much before then.Anyone that&#039;s buying at 2sat right now, or in the past week, has made a mistake. It doesn&#039;t take a genius to figure out the coin is quite stagnant at the moment. I genuinely believe the coin will actually move beyond the 1-2sat ditch its in right now. But even if I believe that, I know its a very stupid idea to go buying at 2sat.I&#039;m interested to see how much volume it picks up on C-CEX though. My thoughts might change.
&gt;&gt;2258929How is it a very stupid idea to buy at 2sat?I just bought 4K at 2sat...unless the coin becomes delisted it&#039;s not gonna go any lower than 2sat (sell side).So that said, read your first sentence...you can do exactly that but then from the sell side.Set a sell at 2 sat which would take a full week or more to fill and you&#039;ve only lost the buy/sell fee.I am not at all trying to shill this coin but it is not at all a very stupid idea to buy now, this is actually a perfect opportunity.If it takes off you make a boatload of money because you bought at the absolute low, if it doesn&#039;t you place a sell at 2sat and wait.I mean...am I missing smth here?
&gt;&gt;2259302Also, the reason why I bought at 2 and not 1, is because there is literally no selling volume, so good luck having your buy order filled at 1.
&gt;&gt;2259302You&#039;re missing the fact that this coin can be traded for other alts, it&#039;s not btc exclusive.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mooncoin/#marketsIt&#039;s extremely risky and you&#039;re really only relying on newbies purchasing this who have no knowledge of crypto.
&gt;&gt;2256920Are buy orders above 2 sats yet? xDAbsolute shitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2259302because there is no liquidity idiot, how are you going to sell at 2 sats? you lost half your money just like that
&gt;&gt;2259360There is enough sell side liquidity. Go to Bleutrade. Also, the volume will obviously increase when it&#039;s added on c-cex.
i will put 500$ in moon, what&#039;s the worst that can happen.Best that can happen is limitless.This shit will go to 10000 sats easy when all the plebs arrive in crypto land buying anything that&#039;s cheap.
&gt;&gt;2259352Well thats not true. If they plan on doing everything they said they would I could see some regulars buying some for cheap atm.
This is the definition of a trash-coinLook at the fucking website, the Twitter, the Devs (blackmail drama)t. Quadrupled money during initial pump
Stratis ICO&gt;NiggercoinXBY&gt;No white paper, scamcoinDGB&gt;Minecraft scamcoinRDD&gt;Reddit normie scamcoinGNT&gt;Jewish scamcoinYou see a pattern here? Theres absolutely no reason why MOON wouldn&#039;t actually moon. New devs, new exchange and more volume equals guaranteed gains.I really believe we will see MOON atleast hovering around 100sat in few months. Thats why I bought 1btc worth at 1sat.
&gt;&gt;2259955This is the most retarded statement I&#039;ve ever seen on biz. Literally no one believes that shit. Tell discord I said hi.
&gt;&gt;2256920Just bought 5mil more at 2sat. I figure there is nowhere for it to go but up! the walls are shifting, this coin will moon
&gt;&gt;2259955Hahaha holy fuck it&#039;s an ACTUAL retard.Are you missing some chromosomes?
&gt;&gt;2260131No no, they have extra chromosomes anon.
Where to buy coins?I&#039;ve got 0.001BTC
I am a NEET in my early 20s and this is my savings account and checking account. I have no loans or debts. What should I do? I barely have expenses per month. I probably spend only around 200 dollars a year on average. How can I move out with this money also? Rent in my area is not too high for a nice apartment and jy parents said they would pay me allowance if I went to school or got a job, but I could easily lie to them.
&gt;&gt;2259487What do you mean how can you move out?You&#039;ve got a ton of money, go rent a place. Hell, buy a place if you want.
&gt;&gt;2259487you have 154k and u never worked or go to school, make sens,and your parent gonna pay you to go to school or to get a job, make sensbased on your story you are an human and oxygen waste, you should stay on your basement until your parents die.
crypto?
&gt;&gt;2259508this
&gt;but I could easily lie to them.You are a piece of shit. How are you 20 and still this fucking gay? Your parents probably fucking hate you, how did they even allow you to become the way you are?Work with you parents. Go to fucking school or get a job and attempt to do something with your life. Holy fuck.
Get a casual job or go to school, and put the 150k into MOON (or, more seriously... STRATIS)
&gt;&gt;2259548My parents are both retired. I am not capable of going to school, and I probably couldn&#039;t get a job either.
&gt;&gt;2259594Why the fuck aren&#039;t you capable of going to school and why can&#039;t you get a job? Even retarded people get jobs.
&gt;&gt;2259594&gt;2259594Why the fuck not?
Invest in a business idea. I will share 35+ business ideas on ideas500k.com
&gt;&gt;2259487Don&#039;t get a fucking allowance from your parents. Get a decent cheap 1 bedroom apartment, get a part time job (movie theater is God-tier), get your parents to pay for college tuition/trade school, and invest a good chunk of your savings (maybe 50k in good crypto longs, 50k more in a decent stock portfolio). You still have over 60k. You&#039;ll be fine. Buy a reliable econobox if you have no car.Also, how the hell do you have this much cash this young?
&gt;&gt;2259487&gt;I probably spend only around 200 dollars a year on averageyeah i call absolute bullshit on thisyou&#039;re telling me with all your spare NEET time you don&#039;t splurge on some bullshit autistic hobby like board games or video games?do you not even know how to cook?
Ive seen this photo with different story on multiple boards
&gt;&gt;2259487Use your money to start a business.
&gt;&gt;2259706saw it last time on r9k, claiming he was a NEET with rich parents
&gt;&gt;2259630&gt;&gt;2259639I only have a 110 IQ and many mental problems. The only job I could get maybe would be minimum wage but I wouldn&#039;t even need the money and I doubt I could go there everyday. I want to stay a NEET forever.
&gt;&gt;2259665I have rich parents. It&#039;s just money they put into my account over time.
&gt;&gt;2259671The only thing I buy are video games.
&gt;&gt;2259487dude, what?
&gt;&gt;2260298IQ doesn&#039;t mean shit for living a normal life. 110 is above average anyway. Get yourself a good shrink and slowly gain some independence. A minimum wage job sucks, but it does help teach you to stick with stuff.If you don&#039;t mind, what sort of mental problems?
Look at all the nigger wagecucks in this thread mad because OP doesn&#039;t have to work.
&gt;&gt;2260306http://revolutionarylifestyledesign.com
&gt;&gt;2260298Oh fuck you. I&#039;ve got Autism, and some other shitty mental problems. Just admit you&#039;re a spoiled little trap boi with a cute little tight boy bussi.
OP is like a young me. I&#039;m almost 40 and never worked single day in my life. But I have like 1.5m $ from parents. They got about 5m total.
&gt;&gt;2260604lmao when biz goes full b
&gt;&gt;2260611And that&#039;s why you spend your days hanging out on a chinese cartoon board you faggot. Because you lie like this, and no one wants to be your friend.
&gt;&gt;2260632You jelly?
waiting for the big announcement next week! (8th June). Don&#039;t be a loser by letting this opportunity pass!Join me and a few other whales and let&#039;s skyrocket this shit to the moon!
&gt;&gt;2259534fuck yeah!
WE
I am new to this, but the team and idea does look promising so far!! What makes you think that it will go to the moon?
We have 2 GS analysts did an audit of some sort. They believe in team and the technology behind it. It seems to be something new. DESU, I dont give a fuck as long as it makes me a shitload of money
&gt;&gt;2259605everything moons.we&#039;re at the beginning of a giant bubble.so it doesn&#039;t really matter what you buy, as long u buy low and not some utter moronic shit.go to bittrex, buy any coin out of the top 100 when its red, resell when u gained 10-20% (or even more when u&#039;re confident enough), rinse and repeat every day.
&gt;&gt;2259627I have invested at 5k satoshis. Lambolaaaand here I come!!!!!
If that shit is not hitting 10k sat by tomorrow, I will buy you lend you mine for a weekend
WHALES join us right now or be poorfags forever!!!
&gt;&gt;2259637Just out of curiosity, as a newfag. Is there a &quot;Top 100&quot; styled list on Bittrex? Or what? How does one check.
&gt;&gt;2259534this coin is actually solid though. why the fuck would /biz/ want it?

&gt;Betting on african subhumans
(((Humaniq)))You can&#039;t give poor people a new way to bank, and potentially have them loose all there money to Whales and PnD investorsYou&#039;d need to back the coin to something, which guaranteed atleast a small amount of positive interest surely&gt;poor africans loosing tons of money to 1st world NEETsSome coins have no shame I guess, I&#039;m really finding it hard to see why an African couldn&#039;t choose whatever shitcoin he thought was best, as opposed to (((humaniq)))
What the fuck does this coin even do?
&gt;&gt;2260573tied to a banking app for third world. indians and africans use it to do basic banking. there are like 3 billion of these people.
&gt;&gt;2260610nice.so all the niggers and shitskins hand over their money to me, while their brothers come to europe and rape our countrys.
Sup you dirty coinwhores,Who&#039;s not stocking ARK and why?This shit will go mental within 3-6 months.
&gt;&gt;2256444I already did OP. I&#039;ve put in $200, where can this can take me?
Literally just bought in holy shit I might finally be making it.
&gt;&gt;2256458We will all make it. We are HODLing ups and downs to lamboland. While /biz/ is too busy cumming with shitcoins, we can reach another universe. Maybe be a top 10 coin, but what the fuck I am dreaming?
&gt;&gt;22564532-5k within the year. who knows after that.
&gt;&gt;2256490in all honesty this is a really fucking solid coin. It has literally all the ingredients for a top 10 coins. I believe in the devs too. They are as good as they get.
Bumping this coin /biz/ is not even thinking about.
&gt;&gt;2256579lolwutdon&#039;t get me wrong, I love ARK but their devs are not &quot;as good as they get&quot;
&gt;&gt;2256579didn&#039;t read the whole paper but it sounds promissingyou care to tell me what the price so far is?i guess i can get it on yobit or polo?on my way to the hospital can&#039;t really look it up right now
&gt;&gt;2257227you can get it on bittrex atm. Price is ~$0.3 - 125M coins.
&gt;&gt;2256444I already am OP. ARK will be the next coin to moon.
everyone on this board who hasnt a stack of Ark should off himself immediately
Fuck it feels good buying in at the bottom of a launch.
&gt;&gt;2257305First real train I actually take
ENGINES ARE RUNNING!Board the ARK!
&gt;&gt;2256444dropped 1/4 dgb for this , even tough dgb will probably moon, this will moon more.
&gt;&gt;2256444Does anyone know a decent exchange u can buy btc with credit card. I did transfer and its taken AGES. Im in Aus, I want to get in on this
Let&#039;s go, I am ready to get two Lambos with this.
Just picked .7 btc of this for a long hodlWitness me
&gt;&gt;2256444Why should it rise, everyone her is just shilling it, without giving any reasons
I think red is a great color for a Lambo
&gt;&gt;2257637read the whitepaper.ark.iosmartbridging, DPoS, smart cards, list goes on..
&gt;&gt;2257505you smart fuck.Enjoy the gains. See you in a year in your lambo
&gt;&gt;2257657But it looks like a bunch of hobo coders.Is this the libertarian coin?How will they make the cards actually work without visa/mastercard.
&gt;&gt;2257669&gt;hobo coders.laughed my ass off from that one, thanks m8.Nah they are actually really smart guys, especially the lead dev francous something..
&gt;&gt;2256444
&gt;&gt;2257966People don&#039;t need crypto currency to &quot;do&quot; thingsTalk about a real meme market
&gt;&gt;2257966wtf is happening?
&gt;&gt;2257966
&gt;&gt;2257966just holding rn
Newfags being scared, unbelievable.
&gt;&gt;2258117Oh got, have we been shilled?
&gt;&gt;2258149Just havin a giggle m8 im hodling Ark 4 life
&gt;&gt;2258166nah, it&#039;s a good coin.Just hold, don&#039;t act weak handed
&gt;&gt;2256444Stop shilling it you retard.I&#039;m still accumulating.
&gt;&gt;2257966just sell-offs... HOLD.Better yet, download the wallet and stake your coins to get more coins daily.
&gt;&gt;2258174smells like shill
&gt;&gt;2258186&gt;&gt;2258190that gave me a DGB flashback.You can still buy when it doubled
&gt;&gt;2258203Why is the shit falling like a rock then ?
&gt;&gt;2258235&gt;Falling like a rock&gt;still up 10%
&gt;&gt;2258235&gt;falling like a rock&gt;was up 20%+&gt;still 10% upwhat are you talking about?
&gt;&gt;2258258Anon is clearly just a weakhanded newfag.This coin needs no shilling, just hodl.
What does this coin do exactly?
&gt;&gt;2258272scam people
&gt;&gt;2258272&gt;&gt;2258285read the whitepaperhttps://ark.io/
&gt;&gt;2258272Nevermind. Seems like a solid project. I&#039;m in.
&gt;tfw bought this shit before it started getting mass shilled on bizthe &quot;less than 3 threads&quot; rule should be in the damn sticky
This coin seems very legit and it has huge room to grow. ALL IN DUDES
&gt;&gt;2256502USD? HOLY SHIT!
buy the dip RIGHT NOW
&gt;&gt;2258317&gt;&gt;2259030Does not compute.
How to stake coins?I&#039;ve downloaded the wallet and got my ARK into it.
&gt;&gt;2259254It&#039;ll happen just by them being in there.Also I just bought 550 ARK. a-am I gonna make it? I sold ANT for this shit..
Can someone explain to me what this is supposed to do?
&gt;&gt;2256444Bought 687 with the BTC I had left from selling other coins. Hopefuly we&#039;ll reach $1+ soon
&gt;&gt;2256444currently holding 100, waiting for the dips to accumulate more
&gt;&gt;2259456https://ark.io/whitepaper
wake me up when its higher than it was last time /biz/ shilled this
&gt;&gt;2259913&gt;wake me up when its pumping so I can panic buy on FOMO then panic sell on the dipsure thing
ARK and STRAT 4 lyfe
&gt;&gt;2257657I don&#039;t know what those words mean
&gt;&gt;2259938sell low, buy high
I&#039;m always suspicious of anything /biz/ recommends but this actually looks solid.
&gt;&gt;2260047Felt the same way famila. Got 600 transferring from bitrex into my wallet now, anyone know what rewards I can expect from delegates?
Gonna buy $2000 worth. Dumb?
&gt;&gt;2260238i just went all in with 1k, i will hold until my money at least triples
&gt;&gt;2256444&gt;go mentalbrit detected
&gt;&gt;2260265Don&#039;t do that, I did it with ETH. When a coin is actually offering something new selling for 3 fold only to see it at 2,000 fold a year later is soul crushing.
&gt;&gt;2260276ok, i will hold until it 2000 folds. Thanks anon
&gt;&gt;2260303Just a heads up based on personal experience, now if I think a coin has potential I&#039;ll sell half @ double or a 3rd @ triple ect.Pic all too related.
Just bought 2400. I set up the wallet and did delegate voting. How does the reward system work for POS in ARK? Anyone have any experience there?
&gt;&gt;2256444How I get ARK?
&gt;&gt;2256579this sounds lies not convincing
&gt;&gt;2260337You can buy it on Bittrex
&gt;&gt;2260327good tactics, i will try to avoid checking in on this too often and drop more fiat into other coins in the meantime
Where is the wallet file for the ark client ?
How do you protect your shitcoins? Is it safe to just leave them in a wallet on bittrex or do you guys have your own wallets for safety?New to this and paranoid of getting hacked and want to know of any safety measures that aren&#039;t too cumbersome for trading.
bumping for interest, i have the same question.
&gt;&gt;2260492Being hacked isn&#039;t really the issue. It&#039;s the exchange getting hacked, going bankrupt and permanently freezing withdrawals. Like how people can&#039;t take money out in greece. That being said, I&#039;m super salty that normies are getting into this who have real money and I&#039;ll just sit here poor while you retarded faggots watch your investments grow. Good luck I guess.
&gt;&gt;2260492each shit coins has its own wallet, some share wallets. need to figure out for each coin (google). Still waiting for the perfect AOI application but..If you plan on trading them within a week keep em on the exchange, if not put em in a wallet.
Long term hold, I keep them on Exodus, Jaxx, and Breadwallet but for trading it&#039;s best to keep them on the exchange. The risk will always exist if you&#039;re trading.
&gt;&gt;2260541Stop being poor. A ton of poor people on this board took out loans and maxed credit because the risk was worth it (and paid off for most). If you aren&#039;t willing to take a fucking risk stay poor.
&gt;&gt;2260492I printed out all my coins on some pieces of paper, cut them out with a pair of scissors, and now I store them in my actual physical leather walletThis is the safests way to do it, if you aren&#039;t doing it like this you are just asking to get hacked
&gt;&gt;2260577What if you lose your wallet?
&gt;&gt;2260560&gt;&gt;2260541You don&#039;t even need to take risks. Be more frugal, work more hours. A lot of shilling goes on but people have made 10x their money on things like DGB recently and you could start with next to nothing.Follow /biz/ and learn to separate shills from people with some insight (rare and hard to spot) and $50 could be $500 next week. This is a best case scenario, of course, but it&#039;s well within the realms of possibility and gives you know excuse to be sitting all salty and gay.
All coins on Poloniex went up in relation to BTC this month.That makes BTC the absolute worst fucking investment on Poloniex to have held for this month, and that&#039;s with Buttcoin staying in a big bubble.I&#039;m just gonna say it straight. Bitcoin is fucking shit. Dump it for literally fucking ANYTHING else (on Poloniex) and you&#039;d have way better returns. If you don&#039;t believe me, look at the &quot;one month&quot; charts on Polo for altcoins in relation to BTC.
Reminder that if you invest in BTC at all instead of altcoins you are 100% normie-tier garbage.
And yet when BTC falls every coin shits its pants instead of mooning fueled by refugees.Really makes you think.
you haven&#039;t accounted for lending gains. I had some loans locked in at 0.5% interest per day for over a month.

&gt;&gt;2258736watching it since you mentioned it. you think it&#039;s about to pop?
Posting with chart. ALK is taking off. 6% in one month. This isn&#039;t a penny stock so poorfags fuck off.&gt;&gt;2258712hodl
&gt;&gt;2258746I don&#039;t think so. There is a bit of support at 1.If it breaks at 1.18-1.23 (it&#039;s at ~1.15 right now) then it&#039;ll have momentum, and it might just reach that 1.25
&gt;&gt;2258760tell me why ALK is better than HA
&gt;&gt;2258760&gt;&gt;2258753&gt;who the fuck flies this airline thoughThey&#039;re opening new ports, they have positive word of mouth (how I heard of them), and their competitors have been getting taken down like alk is hiring a damned assassin. United, jetblue, british airways, all massive PR failure. And ALK is already due to climb out of its Q1 slump.
&gt;&gt;2258673Lol

are there any news for monero? anything to be expected soon? holding for 2 weeks already with a small loss and i really need that cash to invest in something that grows faster but dont want to sell at loss
&gt;&gt;2256961Sub-addresses (generate new addresses without having to create additional wallets) are being merged into the main branch and should be out with the new release in a month or so..
&gt;&gt;2256961&gt;*teaches you a lesson*
ZenCash hits Bittrex soon. Its better than XMR/ZEC/ZCL/BCN/XBB
&gt;&gt;2257006its not better
&gt;&gt;2257018yeah it is. XMR plans on encrypted messaging for the future. Zen already has that plus data storageAnd XMR is just a mixer. Zen actually has end to end encryption
&gt;&gt;2257057Also, Zen has domain fronting which prevents uncle sam from cucking the outlaws
&gt;&gt;2257057End to end encryption of what? To where?
&gt;&gt;2257074?Transactions, messages, data publishing, using the zerocash protocol. Also DAO governance which no other anon coin has
&gt;&gt;2257057&gt;just a mixerZEN has the same downsides of Zcash when it comes to private transactions. At least Zcash has a good team.Don&#039;t get me wrong I do like Zencash. They don&#039;t seem to have a very good idea about how they&#039;re going to do the governance though.
&gt;&gt;2257082That&#039;s retarded though. Blockchains are public to everybody. You broadcast your transactions so they can be propogated to everyone on the network. Anyone with a block exploit can see your transactions. Everyone with a full node had a copy of your transactions. End to end encryption is basically pointless.Broadcasting transactions over I2P as planned with Monero is another matter because in that case no one can know the originating ip for the transaction.And for that other shit you don&#039;t need a blockchain.

Holding monero gives me peace in my heart.
&gt;&gt;2257848same
&gt;&gt;2256961XMR will moon once the whales are finished accumulating. They&#039;re buying up cheap coins every dip then loaning them out to shorters (for almost free) to make sure the price stays down.
&gt;&gt;2256961Monero is the average earner of cryptos. Its like buying a bond at this point.Just hodl
got in at 387, breakeven coming, ftw!
&gt;&gt;2257826&gt;that feel when almost double growth from the recent dip and almost 10x growth over the past monthMooncucks will deny this, though, they&#039;re stuck with their stale poop for good
&gt;&gt;2257826I got in at 307/3011. I was too salty to buy into DGB after selling my bags for so cheap. 1k sats this month for sure.
right... I have serious DGB salt bags ... give me some SC happiness coin gods
&gt;&gt;2258158i fucked up with a stop order of 80k DGB @720 sats when i knew it was going to the moon but this was when DGB was near 1000sats and i believed it wouldn&#039;t tank that low. i was wrong and almost killed myself for it.i&#039;m not in SC for 70k coins. I believe SC will get me financial freedom like DGB would have. i no longer have stop losses for coins i believe in.
&gt;&gt;2257826got in at 360 and out at 392, enjoy trying to break that 400 sell wall
&gt;&gt;2258221the one getting eaten right the fuck up atm? lol
&gt;&gt;2257826Got in at 305 yeterdayfeels good man
r8
&gt;&gt;2258495What was the profit in dollars/euros ?
Am I too late?
&gt;&gt;2258895like 5$
&gt;&gt;2258917Weak handed or Day Trader ?
&gt;&gt;2258914nah we&#039;re going 10x on this at least
&gt;&gt;2258914It was around 400-450 sats before poloniex issues started to appear. It&#039;s ATH was somewhere around 500+. Long story short; it&#039;s going to be at least above 1k sats this month. I don&#039;t know about 10k sats though, that seems way too high. 3-6k sats is my bet.
I hope I&#039;m not too late for this shit.
&gt;&gt;2259301Welp. 27 BTC wall at 400 sats got eaten like little bitch.
&gt;&gt;2259379its was removed.......
Finally sold my bags. Gonna catch the dip at the upper 300&#039;s
&gt;tfw free at last from this shit coin
&gt;&gt;2259379Nope. Look at buy orders.
&gt;&gt;2259429&gt;&gt;2259443&gt;3 weeks laterWahhh /biz/ why didn&#039;t you tell me to hold!!!!
&gt;&gt;2259479&gt;&gt;2259426I bought some of that wall so I doubt it.
Bought like 4k at 205 :( Wish I bought more.
just bought at 390 and im not even concernedthis will hit 800 soon
&gt;&gt;2259533I&#039;m actually a bit concerned not with SIA though. It has only risen like 100 sats in last 2 days so it&#039;s safe to assume it won&#039;t dip too hard. This friday is way too crazy, even the shitiest of alts are exploding in green. Huge correction is coming. I hope last saturday bloodbath won&#039;t happen tommorow again...
&gt;mfw finally able to sell this shitcoinThanks for holding my bags, faggots.
&gt;&gt;2259443&gt;&gt;2259632=&gt;&gt;2259429
IT HIT A PENNY
&gt;&gt;2259702oh BABY
&gt;&gt;2259702Not the first time its hit a penny.
sold at 399
TO THE MOON
10k sats, if this thing hits 10k sats ill go buy scotch and do fuck all today, hmmm, im already doing fuck all. well, ill add scotch to it!
&gt;&gt;226020110k sats would be equivalent of DGB hitting 1$. That&#039;s huge. Don&#039;t get my hopes up.
1.6 mil hodlThis baby is goin to $0.20
&gt;&gt;2260244Got in at 150 sat btw
&gt;&gt;2260290420 bab woo
&gt;&gt;2260290Are you that guy who had 700btc+ worth of SIA? and posted it here?
Ah did not consider market cap... no scotch
&gt;&gt;2260309&gt;1.6 mil hodlah nvm. There was that one guy here with ~700btc of SIA at poloniex here. I hope he won&#039;t dump on us, lol.
&gt;&gt;2260309No, that would be me.I got in at ~ 30 sat.
&gt;&gt;2260309no, that would be me. what would you like to know?
&gt;&gt;2257826Hodling strong since 150, then doubled down at 240, then went in again at 380. All the idiots that are selling are obviously not looking at the volume and the crazy walls that have been set. Someone is accumulating.
&gt;&gt;2260370someone, indeed.
&gt;&gt;2260336&gt;&gt;2260365I don&#039;t know which one of you mofos is the real one, but I envy you so much. You are pretty much millionaire at this moment. All you have to do is just slowly putting 1btc sell orders. I&#039;m shaking with excitement thinking about my 0.3 btc gains from my 250k coins. I can&#039;t imagine what you are even thinking atm. Fuck. I&#039;m impressed.
&gt;&gt;2257826does it run on ethereum?
&gt;&gt;2260447just sit back, hang on, and enjoy the ride.
&gt;&gt;2260447It&#039;s a weird feeling because I held onto this coin for over a year, saw it rise up to 178 last summer then crash. And now it&#039;s back up and I&#039;m basically a millionaire. I still remember when 1btc could buy you a couple million sia.The only thing I&#039;m thinking is just a dry &#039;&#039;yaaaaaaaaay I&#039;m rich&#039;&#039;. But still, I&#039;m happy and it&#039;s likely sia will reach even higher gains by the end of the year,
&gt;&gt;2260486Are you the fuck with 88 million sia?If so grats, Im jelly as fuck
&gt;&gt;2260523nvm didnt read the thread.
&gt;&gt;2260523Yep, that&#039;s me.
&gt;&gt;2260486&gt;&gt;2260550Impressive. My ultimate goal in crypto was basically what you have just achieved. SIA will be huge for sure so your BTC stash might become even crazier. I&#039;ll be just happy with my 10x gains. Not going to sell it until it&#039;s at least 3-6k. What will you do with you money though? are you going straight for fiat or just invest into other coins?. Shit. You might become some cryptoking.
&gt;&gt;2260550are you going to talk to a finance professional about how to start cashing out?I would immediately max out my IRA, FSA, and HSA at the very least. If you quit your job for a year you won&#039;t have to pay anything in capital gains.
&gt;&gt;2260550also, thoughts on swarm?
Op from xby moon thread at just under teo centsXby is set to double today.Hodl anons

&gt;&gt;2257689is she going to explode when it reaches 1$?also at this point, those breasts are considered mutations and is not sexually attractive unless you are a subhuman degenerate
Not gonna lie, former DGB holder here. This is painful watching it moon but in all seriousness we cant let this coin get to 1 dollar.
&gt;&gt;2257723By the looks of it - it will happen by the time we reach $.10
&gt;&gt;2257729we can nigger
&gt;&gt;2257729Holy shit that&#039;s a Dead Sea level of saltiness

So memes really can become dreams.
&gt;&gt;2257804Sia BTFO
&gt;&gt;2257833Also. This is the anon that will get a tattoo of dgb-tan if it hits $.50-1
&gt;&gt;2257483Can anybody tell me in a few sentences what makes Digibyte unique?Went on website and bitcointalk but it feels like all Altcoinswebsites are the same.So please tell me why I should drop some coin into DGB.
&gt;&gt;2257850Short answer or long answer?
&gt;&gt;2257862Sell it to me like I own ETH.
&gt;&gt;22574831337
&gt;&gt;2257881What makes DGB good compared to other coins but not unique&gt;segwit&gt;large coin cap (21billion) means small transfer fees&gt;not pre-mined (so many new coins are pre-mined so worth mentioning)What makes it unique/nearly unique&gt;fastest coin on the market&gt;5 mining algos with ability to change (devs have said they are looking into other non-PoW algos that could be integrated) in order to reach a larger mining audience&gt;this alongside the game integration and the initial DGBGaming events means it&#039;s massive decentralised (not as many huge holders, lots of smaller holders/wider audience compared to market cap) because there are a lot of spread out miners and holders and whales can&#039;t have the fun with it that they have with other coins&gt;3 years of solid consistent development from the same experienced team that hasn&#039;t changed&gt;dynamic block time scaling every 2 years it gets twice as fast&gt;looking at Visa-tier transaction times by 2025Make your own choices but these idiotic FUDers saying DGB has nothing going for it, well they are ill-informed or lying.
tfw I soldI lost all my greed and wanted to be safeMy heart can&#039;t take this man
&gt;&gt;2257483I really want to buy in but I have the sinking feeling it&#039;s going to normalize back to 1000 any minute now, probably right after I buy.
&gt;&gt;2257915Learn from that. Be a motherfucker like Belfort, else you&#039;ll always lose
&gt;&gt;2257926A mate of mine bought at 600 , he felt bad cause it went down a lot, even as far as like 480 at one point. He&#039;s over doubled his money now.
&gt;&gt;2257910Fair points.I wish you luck.Already made $2.7MM from other coins.I&#039;m still mad that DGB today rose more than STRAT. Tfw. &quot;only&quot; +33% compared to DGB&#039;s +68%I didn&#039;t buy DGB because I knew knowing about it when I first saw it here and it was already at 112 sats. But then again I didn&#039;t buy any of the /biz/ pumps even though they all seemed to have worked out very well for most people. (DGB, MOON, RDD, Xtrabytes, WINGS etc. etc.)
&gt;&gt;2257968Moon is probably the shitcoin to end all shitcoins and nothing will ever happen there again
&gt;&gt;2257968True but I&#039;m telling you, this isn&#039;t a /biz/ pump. It&#039;s got a huge market cap now and massive potential. Long holding this shit.
How am I suppose to sleep tonight if I need to be staring at this chart the entire time?
&gt;&gt;2257968&gt;Already made $2.7MM from other coins.HOWall i want from life is to be a comfy crypto millionaire. if legit, give us your wisdom.
&gt;&gt;2257986You don&#039;t.I&#039;ve done it before.Also I bought back in after seeing the next sell wall. Already hit 1400 and back into a dip again. Feels good.
&gt;&gt;2257994The worst thing about these alt coins is that setting stop losses aren&#039;t even a good idea most of the time since whales can do controlled dumps to take some profit pretty easily, I&#039;ll probably just set a price alarm and get woken up after 2 hours of sleep.
&gt;&gt;2257986&gt;&gt;2257994After the moon from ~300 to 970 I didn&#039;t sleep for 2 days. My boyfriend put me to bed in the end and I slept for 14 hours. Was a fantastic fucking thing seeing my money go up like that. We just moved in together and want to buy a house so this is helping a lot on building a deposit.
&gt;&gt;2258028Faggot.Good for you, though. May your gains continue.
&gt;&gt;2258020&gt;he still thinks DGB is whale controlledIt isn&#039;t. They can do a lot but not huge dumps like on the real shitcoins that run on whaleoil. Look at it&#039;s market cap compared to the P&amp;D&#039;s.
&gt;&gt;2258028&gt;&gt;&gt;/lgbt/
&gt;&gt;2257989&gt;Be at /g/ /b/ in 2009&gt;See tons of lol BTC threads&gt;Don&#039;t buy into any of this shit&gt;Think it will go nowhere&gt;Observe all pumps in 2011&gt;Observe BTC in 2013 going to 80 and 250&gt;Summer holidays&gt;See LTC launch&gt;It might become the next BTC&gt;How the fuck can I put money into this&gt;TFW all sites sketchy as fuck and don&#039;t work with my bank account&gt;Try get money into BTC-e and finally give up because it looks like a scam&gt;LTC goes from $0.01 to 4 bucks&gt;Meh whatever&gt;Autum 2013&gt;Can&#039;t take it any longer&gt;BTC @$600&gt;BUY into LTC @$10&gt;Sell on the way down ~$30&gt;Went into Doge&gt;Get into the Altcoin scene&gt;Build moderately traded Portfolio&gt;Most coins go nowhere some to shit others to GoldThe secret is to stay always updated and informed. Those who were just buying and holding the coins of 2013 didn&#039;t have many gains.
&gt;&gt;2258028You probably don&#039;t want to normie blog like that, remember where you are posting.&gt;&gt;2258037The market cap is getting bigger for it to be harder for them, but for the last few weeks there&#039;s definitely been a few whales cashing out slowly, they set smallish walls and move them slowly down to cash out, obviously this is when volume slows down again. I have 70% of my portfolio in DGB so I&#039;ve been keeping a very close eye on it.
&gt;&gt;2257689I&#039;m not sure which one is hotter.
&gt;&gt;2258055&gt;You probably don&#039;t want to normie blog like that, remember where you are posting.Why don&#039;t I want to do that in a couple hours this thread will be gone and you&#039;ll never see this ID again.

&gt;&gt;2257723&gt;tfw that&#039;s my fetish
&gt;&gt;2257910Dgb is premined boyo
&gt;&gt;2258053so how much are your crypto gains?
&gt;&gt;2258100Not 100%, not even close to 100%
&gt;&gt;2258112Not sure how much but I know a pretty decent chunk is premined.I just sold off some of my position. I&#039;ve literally tripled my money and still have like 50k coins in. Playing with the houses money after they payed me like a grand. It&#039;s a good feel.
what site should I use to buy DGB? coinbank only hosts 3 btcsor is it too late? i have $1000 to drop
buy this dip. we attack 1500 next.
&gt;&gt;2258100.5% premine for giveaways and early adopters. Nice try boyo.
&gt;&gt;2258145Where can you margin trade DGB?
oh manThe sell walls are being createdIRON HANDS REPORT IN
I&#039;m errect.
IRON DICKS REPORT IN AS WELL

&gt;&gt;2258241WHO CARES IF IT&#039;S VERTICAL OR CURVED. HODL YOUR FUCKING COINS. IRON HANDS!

1500 SATS SELL WALL INCOMINGGUYS I DON&#039;T THINK I CAN HANDLE THIS, IF I SELL NOW I WILL MAKE 2X MY INITIAL INVESTMENTwhat do
&gt;&gt;2258354sellthis round of pump is almost done
&gt;&gt;2258170&gt;what site should I use to buy DGB? coinbank only hosts 3 btcs&gt;or is it too late? i have $1000 to dropwtf? gtfo
&gt;&gt;2258360According to what? Volume going up, buys still high, sell walls forming.Sounds good to me. It&#039;s pretty steady. A pump wouldn&#039;t suddenly end like this.
i just started on bitrex, I cant use cash to buy coins? I have to transfer coins from another site? help
&gt;&gt;2258368lol, you clearly haven&#039;t followed the market at allsell walls are NOT forming, most of them have been fucking removed to get this spikeyou have no idea how high the sell walls were 2 days ago, do you lol
&gt;&gt;2258375you need to transfer bitcoin from a wallet to bittrex and exchange those bitcoins with other walletsTo get bitcoins, there are tons of ways. First download a wallet app for your phone (mycelium is a good one) and then go to your closest bitcoin ATM, or go to coinbase.
&gt;&gt;2258391*and exchange those bitcoins with other coins
&gt;&gt;2258391Okay, i thought so. I have a coinbase account, I&#039;ll buy some coins there and transfer
&gt;&gt;2258383And this pump started two days ago right?Nothing is signalling a crash. At least explain your FUD clearly.Sell walls are obviously forming. Compare what they are now to 30 or so minutes ago.
&gt;&gt;2258400nah I&#039;ve explained to this board about 50 times how to read the charts and I&#039;ve seen little to no improvementsthere is a large divergence in the MAC-D indicator right now, it just went fucking parabolic, and is overbought on the bollinger bandwhat the fuck kind of indicators are you using?
Lol, if this is a pump and dump I will hold. It&#039;s only the 2nd of June. The 8th and 9th should be insane gains. All the speculation that close the Citi event.HODL!!!!!!!!!
After being a firm nocoiner for about 5 years I finally accepted I was wrong and want to get rich with you guys.I took all my money (3k) and opened a Coinbase account.As someone who doesn&#039;t know shit about this which shitcoin is my best chance for a lambo? XBY, XEM, or DGB? Please I just want to get rich.
There&#039;s like 10 of these posts on the front page at all times
None of those are going to make you rich, the only way you make insane gains is by following your own path and getting luckyYou might collect some good interest, minus the DGB that has mooned to insanity today
Ancient asian trading secret:Lurk moar
&gt;&gt;2260394Congrats on making the best decision of your life.I would recommend the following coins to someone in your situation.GNT, ANT, BAT, Bancor ICO, Tezos ICO, DGB.Out of those DGB I feel the worst about, but you&#039;ll still make money. Just please don&#039;t panic sell or buy and hold for a long time. I had 150k ripple that I sold for $7,000 and I was so happy that I had 6x my money, but like a month later it would&#039;ve been worth $60,000. Don&#039;t sell yourself short, if you want to take profits maybe take half. Don&#039;t try to daytrade though.
&gt;&gt;2260593Why do you say no to daytrading?
&gt;&gt;2260593Thanks a lot I will look into all these. My plan is what you said, split the money up between four or five shitcoins and just hold for a month and see where I am. Let&#039;s get rich guys!
&gt;&gt;old house that needs to be renovated worth between 190k-215k acoording to real estate agent&gt;&gt;no listing price, been offered 225k&gt;&gt;you chose my counter offer:&gt;&gt;325k&gt;&gt;265k&gt;&gt;240kor accept the offer.
&gt;&gt;2260606230k and seller gets to swallow whatever he extracts until the end of escrow
some guys going insane on TOT right now?
DGB has a lot of potential, but right now it needs a correction. Notice that the price is far above the MACD, and when this happens the price tends to drop and bounce UNDER the MACD. You can check this with every coin on POLONIEX, Historically it has been this way.&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN&gt; EVERY COINEVERY COIN
&gt;&gt;2260424WOW! amazing, it is true!
&gt;&gt;2260424Grandpa, where you when DGB transcended reality and kept mooning?
&gt;&gt;2260544Working from home on a pleasant Friday afternoon
TA don&#039;t do shit on crypto, price only only goes where the giant water mammals want them to
Yeah or it could take a big fat load on you and shoot to 1500
I&#039;ve been trading the stock market for 6 years and trust me when I say that a different set of rules apply for crypto.Go ahead and try ruin the game but only the intermediate people will believe this.Idiots won&#039;t understand it-- People with experience will ignore it.Go get some mooncoin dude :^)
Thanks for the tip last night lads, picked up 150. How long are you hodling for?
I like shift because it&#039;s basically a worse version of ARK designed for normies. Normies love that Apple aesthetic. Holding for now and making sell or buy decisions based on later performance.
&gt;&gt;2260457Look for coins on coinmarketcap.com that you believe to be roughly equivalent to shift in terms of worth/use; Ark if you are conservative, Lisk if you are a moon day dreamer. Once Shift catches up, then sell.
&gt;&gt;2260457I&#039;ve got a few. I&#039;m not sure how long I&#039;ll hold, but probably for at least the medium term.It&#039;s pretty similar to ARK, so I think they have approximately the same value speculatively. ARK is probably quite undervalued too, so that arguably makes SHIFT a better but slightly riskier investment.
Don&#039;t say I did not warn you.&gt;low coin supply&gt;major marketing campaign incoming&gt;bittrex confirmed
&gt;&gt;2258628Gambling degenerate
&gt;&gt;2258638You dont gamble, you hold coins and get dividends from gamblers
&gt;&gt;2258628I&#039;m in. any idea when bittrex?
&gt;&gt;2258943Dev confirmed that very soon, so i expect it next week
&gt;&gt;2259015Thanks. Checking Their site out now
&gt;&gt;2258628How about the fair distribution, if its not fair then people like JPMorgan and other professional whales should be the ones backing it. Look ETH, total scam but their marketing was good and the whales kinda predictable and slow enough to don&#039;t overkill the market capitalization.
where&#039;s the ann page on bitcoin forum
just bought 230 of them. they made some updates for bittrex.https://smartplay.tech/news/smartplay.tech-moves-to-a-new-system-of-dividends-payout?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=free_post&amp;utm_campaign=newsi think this will be big.
&gt;&gt;2259375I&#039;m still reading on it. where did you buy? This could be a big one. even if it is just PND&#039;D nicely once on the exchanges but oneof the first tokens to pay you for hodl&#039;ing
&gt;&gt;2259445it&#039;s only on livecoin so i bought there.as you said EVEN it&#039;s just a pnd, we will be early adopters.
&gt;&gt;2259477make me want to dump another eth on it
&gt;roulette blockchain&gt;not a scamYou can only pick one.This is the memiest coin of them all. It&#039;s worse than fucking DGB, and that one is fucking Minecraft for 12 year olds.There are too many coins with all these platforms. Hope you are ready to gamble in choosing the right one.
&gt;&gt;2259707mad gains to be made from the memiest of coins m8
Bought 3 800 RLT, you better be right OP
What to buy: moom or rlt?
&gt;&gt;2259707The ebst atm is edgeless by far.They are the smot serious project.They also applied for a gamblinf license to be able to accept fiat.They offer no edge.They got great devs and they got tons of money for expansion, legal issues and marketing.Platform is being released in june/july(no exact date yet).Its gonna 100 mill easy.

Time to get creative, /biz/.&gt;Background infoMy local credit union has a checking account that offers 2% APY.&gt;What&#039;s the catch?You need to make 10 debit purchases from the account per month.&gt;What&#039;s wrong with that?Using a credit card for day to day purchases offers much better rewards and fraud protection.&gt;What do you propose?I could use the debit card to purchase some investment, that way I&#039;m not spending money on stupid shit just to qualify for the APY.&gt;What kind of investment?Really anything with value.&gt;Ideas?I know that you can buy gold with a debit card via a Goldmoney account, and Bitcoins/Ethereum via a Coinbase accounts.&gt;ConsiderationsI&#039;d like these 10 purchases per month to be automated so I don&#039;t have to think about it. I know that I can automate both Goldmoney and Coinbase.Any other ideas? Any apps that will let me auto-purchase stocks/ETFs/alternatives using a debit card?Let&#039;s hear some /biz/ ideas.
An idea:Use the Coinbase API to write a Python script that will make 10 purchases automatically and send them to my margin funding wallet on Bitfinex.
Use it to pay bills
&gt;&gt;2260512I do that on my credit card so that I only have one bill to pay every month
Just buy a cup of coffee or a candy bar lol.
You guys realize only 100 people own Bat, and most of them are institutional investors/corporations.There will be like no coins on the market.The market is going to completely starve.I predict $1 BAT within a couple weeks, $5-$10 this year. Shit is still just 15 cents.
&gt;&gt;2260084have fun holding those 7x ICO bags for the next year.
&gt;&gt;2260084If your trying to convince people to buy it your SOL. they should have been more fair with the ICO.
&gt;&gt;2260142nothing in crypto is fair, get used to it.
Its already trickling down...There are thousands of BAT owners.Stop being delusional butthurt morons.You got owned, instead of crying about it do something.Losers will always be losers.
bought 57 just in case. not getting my hopes up
&gt;&gt;2260142&gt;&gt;2260130Remember. It took just 1 million$ 24 hr volume to hit the top 20 coins.Most top 20 coins do 20-50 mill a day!Once it hits bittrex and polo and real money touches it, it&#039;s going to explode. Whales aren&#039;t going to sell this shit,they are corporations who stored it away already.
bought 100,000ez
&gt;&gt;2260148fuck you fgt. You know that&#039;s not the point i was making. Be more useless.
THIS IS NOT A DRILLTHIS IS NOT A DRILLBAT team just transferred 1 BAT to Bittrex.&gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0xac2fa512db158f44f5ee2fa5766ea7c282763cdb#tokentxns
Where can I buy BAT? I still beleive in the future of the project even if the ICO was scummy.&gt;&gt;2260436Pls let her have a penis
&gt;tfw 1/100
&gt;&gt;2260180not about to buy your bags faggotthe smart institutions are going to dump it as soon as it hits an exchange with enough liquidity to do so
Is liqui.io legit? Why is this weird russian exchange the only one selling BAT?
i keep hearing shit about people in africa who don&#039;t have bank accounts. how much money do you think will come into crypto on account of these guys?
Come back when there&#039;s a blood diamond coin
&gt;need power, computer and internetI don&#039;t think the parts of Africa without banks are going to be an emerging market any time soon.
&gt;&gt;2260458what about facebook blimps? and all that bill gates money?
It&#039;s not safe to have a tiger in your house desu.
&gt;&gt;2260368Like 1 dollar collectively.
&gt;&gt;2260475i&#039;ve heard of humaniq but didn&#039;t look into it. thanks jewfriend
&gt;&gt;2260538Look into Bitland / CADASTRALS as well my friendBut not e-dinars as those are a scam
Is there anything more comfy than generating money while you lay around all day?
&gt;&gt;2260056no
What&#039;s the initial startup cost to make bitcoin mining worth it?
&gt;&gt;2260313yeah a mining general thread would be nice for questions like this
&gt;&gt;2260056Whats your hardware?
&gt;&gt;22603552x Xeon 2697v3 for xmr3x GTX 980 w/ custom bios for ETH1x GTX 1060 for ETHand several random CPUs/GPUs that are like at 120% break even for xmr (i5-2400, i5-2500, GTX 680, 2x RD7850)I was mining 100% eth but there has been a huge shift in the mining rate last week. I like xmr too.
&gt;&gt;2260395oh and an i5-3570k for xmr
&gt;&gt;2260313Too much for average joe, gpu mining on the other hand is pretty comfy right now.
&gt;&gt;2260395I&#039;m already using my GPU to mine, would it be worth it to mine something on my i3-6100 as well?
&gt;&gt;2260395&gt;&gt;2260395those CPU are insanely expensivehow much you earning per day?
&gt;&gt;2260537About $50 at current prices. If I do a historical lookup on the price increases since I started mining it&#039;s probably closer to $100 or $150.I&#039;ve mined for a long time, I made a lot of money in the 2012 era (was one of the first big time CPU miners of XPM) then lost interest until the ASIC-resistant coins starting gaining traction again.Two years ago I was upset I didn&#039;t just drop out of grad school and build a mining farm but in retrospect now I could never have competed with nationalized chinese electricity and covert ASICBOOST so I&#039;m glad I stuck with my career
&gt;&gt;2260575I&#039;ll just add that I&#039;ve learned that the best hobbies are the ones that make you moneyIt&#039;s like having multiple careers without jumping from job to job
&gt;tfw you always miss on buying during the flatland period&gt;tfw all those annoying $0.1-$0.2 pumps look like big pumps but in perspective it&#039;s all flatFuck you guys. Im holding POSW until $1+. It&#039;s actually useful unlike all those dumb ICO&#039;s (that pump a lot), it has masternodes coming, it has constant updates, ETH will go PoS and will get added there and normies hate running wallets so they will stake the coins there, they are legit and keep paying dividends, all devs are native americans regardless what the pajeet meme says (even tho I don&#039;t get why pajeet is a bad thing when pajeets are running the tech game now, but anyway they aren&#039;t pajeets). The africa shit was removed from the roadmap (and it was tax evasion practice anyway so I would be ok with it since I would do it tho).The total supply is too small for the price to have peaked at 2 cents forever. It&#039;s not even on big exchanges yet. And it will be since all exchanges care about is fees, and this coin will drive traffic to those exchanges since its gateway coin for all those staking coins on the main site.Get the fuck in.
Low IQ autists think coins like Xtrabytes have an higher chance to reach $1 than POSW.Xtra total supply: 650,000,000You need $650,000,000 marketcap aka top10 coin to reach $1Meanwhile POSW only needs $41,000,000 marketcap to reach $1Fucking idiots.
&gt;&gt;2257712It also has devs dumping in your stupid ass
&gt;&gt;2258861Devs wait until the big pump because they are smart enough to create the coin on the first place.
&gt;&gt;2258830no shit sherlock, who the fuck says xtrabytes has a higher chance?
&gt;&gt;2258887POSW FUDsters.
&gt;&gt;2257712sia and verge?
&gt;&gt;2257712idiotnow the whales will be coming at us and ruin poswshould&#039;ve kept quiet baka baka
It needs a $41,000,000 market cap to reach $1. That&#039;s it.If a shitcoin like PIVX can hit $2 with an even higher supply, so can POSW.
F

Watch in amusement as the bones in his hand disintegrate from the impact, looks like weighs not even 100 lbs
&gt;&gt;2258933You can name those twins ethereum and ethereum classic then
&gt;The human being that has made me more money than any other is assaulting his literal opposite.I trust him.
&gt;&gt;2258915get all buddy-buddy with him and employ my Slav resistence to alcohol alongside superior body weight to drink the dyel under the table only to extract his wallet and private key info
ask him for some eth in exchange for 7 minutes with my gfI will give my gf 1/3 of the eth too
He&#039;s made me $100k so I&#039;ll let him do whatever the fuck he wants to her
&gt;&gt;2258915Everything he touches turns to goldIll allow it
&gt;&gt;2259058Underrated post.
&gt;&gt;2258947kek
Turn supersyrian and send him to his dad king gold
&gt;Year is 2030&gt;Every currency trades against DGB&gt;DGB is the global currency&gt;Bitcoin is worth 0.00001 DGB and has been delegated to a p&amp;d shitcoin&gt;ETH is also a shitcoin and is worth 0.000000001 DGB&gt;/biz/bros who HODL&#039;ed have multiple lambos
&gt;&gt;2260182sell the hype before the news
did mommy ever tell you you have a very vivid imagination?
&gt;&gt;2260182&gt;ETH is worth less than BTCTry again.
We are the future, lads.

&gt;&gt;2260302xd nice meme idiot
&gt;&gt;2260285&gt;coin as big as ethdoesnt mention stratis
&gt;&gt;2260302rofl
&gt;&gt;2260302superhuman bitcoin hodlers confirmed
&gt;&gt;2260182mfw this is actually going to happen through the power of memes
What cryptocurrency do you envision camwhores using? What is the most camwhore friendly coin? I&#039;m sure they are tired of paying fees to the middle man and want a decentralised system.
&gt;&gt;2260071She is so incredibly cute I want to neck myself.
&gt;&gt;2260071VGINA coin is good for them. Perfect really.
&gt;&gt;2260080nigger, this is a serious thing. camwhores are big buisiness
&gt;&gt;2260104ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALLOW TIPS WITHOUT USING YOUR CREDIT CARD
&gt;&gt;2260104But that lips shape, neck and hair...
&gt;&gt;2260071Reddcoin?
&gt;&gt;2260122that&#039;s not an /fa/ way to do things. tips by text is like executing things by command line. you need something more hip
&gt;&gt;2260071&gt;asian but blonde&gt;actual cute face&gt;chokerFuck I don&#039;t want to fall in love, not like this!
&gt;&gt;2260122I&#039;m a massive bagholder on RDD so if anyone is a member of a camwhore site and likes to shill, why not combine those interests and get camwhores into RDD? ty in advance
&gt;&gt;2260080I want to strangle her thin fragile neck.
&gt;&gt;2260071Bitcoin once it becomes capable of micro transactions. Seriously this &quot;we need seperate currencies for everything&quot; meme is retarded.
&gt;&gt;2260225when will that happen.
&gt;&gt;2260071Monero for privacy?
&gt;&gt;2260254problem with all the privacy coins is all you need is a few services set up where you can send your bitcoin to them and receive [privacy-coin] in return for a low-ish fee (which makes it profitable for these sites to pop up). then a site that does the reverse and theres no reason to hold those coins long term, just use them as the service they really are.
&gt;&gt;2260246neverbuy litecoin
&gt;newfags don&#039;t even know about 18+, CAM, PORN or the dozens of other shitcoins that have tried to tap into the camwhore marketThe most successful one by far was Doge with /r/GirlsGoneDogeCoin/ and several other porn sites accepting it.
&gt;&gt;2260071Probaby DGB, since it will be a gamer coin, but DGB is over valuated now, it needs a correction to about 1030 sats.Notice that the price is far above the MACD, and when this happens the price tends to drop and bounce UNDER the MACD. You can check this with every coin on POLONIEX, Historically it has been this way.
&gt;&gt;2260412yeah i suppose that line helped bitcoin go up too right?Oh wait no it didnt.
&gt;&gt;2260412Yeah, it just doesn&#039;t work that way. Because, if it pumps a ton more, the blue line will jump up and it&#039;s not overvalued at this point. And in the end you don&#039;t know what will happen
I have 300 dollars to throw at a coin. What coin do I put it in?
&gt;&gt;2260472DGB or be prepared to kill yourself at the end of the summer.
Mooncoin
DGB and Sia
&gt;&gt;2260472ARK, might win big or loose it all
&gt;&gt;226047250 in Sia50 in Digi100 in 808 and stake them in the wallet for a year100 in the top twenty on Coinmarket
I took two days off from crypto to get some rest from the 24hr market and now everything is going parabolic again. Anyone found any coins that look like they&#039;re going to break out? Best I got was double dipping on RDD.
&gt;mfw had 50,000 DGB last week&gt;sold them thinking i&#039;d buy the dip&gt;it doesn&#039;t dip&gt;only have 13,000 DGB now&gt;DGB is going to $1 by June 9th&gt;will only have a measly $13,000FML
&gt;&gt;2258541Same here but its better than nothing :)
&gt;&gt;2258541learned your lesson, just hold and enjoy your 10 grand, re-invest in other things
&gt;&gt;2258541&gt;could&#039;ve put a hundred into dgb at 20 sats&gt;got held back because of my momWorst part is she&#039;s in debt and the money I would have had by now would&#039;ve paid it all off. I fucking hate this feeling, it&#039;s driving me insane.
&gt;&gt;2258541I did the same thing. Sold all of mine DGB at 850 yesterday and today I wake up and it&#039;s fucking over a THOUSAND SATS WTFFFF
Bought 25k or so at 650 sats and knew this shit will explodeBought anotther 15k or so at 1100 sats.Will buy more as soon as I get my money. Depending on june 9 this will make me want to lose my virginity
&gt;&gt;2258707I just want to thank you for this post. I started a week or so ago with $220. It wasn&#039;t everything I had but it&#039;s a lot to me. I sold it last night around 1100 when I could have just held it. I&#039;m just praying that it dips back down below 1100 and I&#039;ll buy it all back, I&#039;ve learned my strong hands lesson, but I&#039;ve been stressing about it, I just need to learn to be happy for what I have. It&#039;s been stressful since I got in it and I think about it all the time, since I&#039;m not in an amazing financial position, but I still didn&#039;t invest enough to effect me at all, it&#039;s just stressful. Just gotta be happy with the little bit I made.
&gt;&gt;2258750Post DGB wallet address
A win is a win, if you focus on what could have been you will drive yourself nuts.
&gt;&gt;2258777I&#039;m out of the house right now but I promise you I will if this thread is still up in three hours. I had my wallet synched every day and wanted to try mining it way early on but I could never figure it out. I wanted this coin to succeed so bad, I still it to succeed but it hurts so damn much.
&gt;&gt;2258541Serves you right for being a weak handed faggot.
&gt;&gt;2258541&gt;had 1 million XBY&gt;had 700k DGB&gt;sell them to buy XEM&gt;XEM barely movesI&#039;ve already made so much money, I should just be happy. But seeing how much I could have from XBY and DGB now is driving me nuts.
So are we all selling at $1? Or $10?
&gt;&gt;2258827At 22k DGB im not selling till around 5-10
&gt;&gt;2258827Dumbass. This is ETH-tier investment. In 2-3 years DGB will be a massive corporation and it will be top 10 steady coin. But sell whenever you want it&#039;s your money faggot.
&gt;&gt;2258541&gt;DGB is going to $1 by June 9thI thought it was just a quick pump and dump?
&gt;&gt;2258912No man this shit is the real dealNever listen to the retarded fudsters and just hodl it like these titties
At what point do you stop HODLing?Do you set a goal?
&gt;&gt;2258541Now&#039;s the time to buy. $1 is near - you don&#039;t want to miss that out.
&gt;&gt;2258750so you take financial advice from someone who&#039;s in debt? sad!
&gt;&gt;2258891Pretty much this
Dont worry anon, im sitting on a measly 5k digis
&gt;&gt;2258912Nope. DGB is not a p&amp;d. It&#039;s a solid coin.If you want to see a real p&amp;d take a look at MOON. Not a nice view though.
&gt;&gt;2258777DCphBEgPgm4qWFewoL7zVaiixMchTNd2Mw&gt;tfw fell for the mooncoin memepls let me on the dgb train
&gt;tfw bought waves at $2&gt;sold at 1.80 thinking it was going to crash&gt;mfw it was a bear trap&gt;in three days it went to $4.50K-KILL ME.
sent ;)
Should I sell my 10 eth on poloniex and put it all into DGB?
What a bunch of fucking shills trying to still their shit coin
&gt;&gt;2259416Yes, absolutely.DGB is completely different compared to BTC/ETH, within 3-5 years there will be millions of online players that will be playing 8 hours a day just to mine 1 DGB and here you have an opportunity to tens of thousands with the price of an iPhone.
&gt;saw the dip on my radar&gt;bought at 782 and sold at 874 for quick gainsShould I just KYS myself?
&gt;&gt;2259286It would have to have a marketcap of 8 Billion by 1$
I bought my DGB at 200 and sold all my DGB at 700, thought I&#039;d beat the game, but no.
&gt;&gt;2259501Why do you all you retards keep saying this as if it couldn&#039;t happen? DGB&#039;s market cap doubled in 4 days, after doubling in 10 days... It&#039;s doing exactly what Ripple did but faster because it&#039;s a better coin and crypto investors know (people not on biz, I mean). DGB could hit 10 billion market cap in a couple of months at the rate people are investing crypto as a whole
&gt;&gt;2259526Calm your tiddies mate i just pointed it out.Nothing is impossible in crypto.It could double today or it could go to 0.00 tomorrow who the fuck knows
&gt;&gt;2258750&gt;&gt;2258777I&#039;m in too - post your DGB wallet
&gt;&gt;2258541pretty much the same on this end&gt;i started with 20k dgb&gt;traded up to 30k&gt;sold at 840&gt;tfw no dips&gt;shoots over 1k sats&gt;buy back in at only 17k dgbi want to die
&gt;&gt;2259693&gt;0.0In theory the lowest price would be 1 sat, not
&gt;&gt;2258801How do I know it&#039;s you then :) Hope you have the same id.
&gt;&gt;2260038&gt;&gt;2259734Here&#039;s hoping. Anything to fill the void will ease my spirit loads. Maybe now I can put all my hours of lurking to use.DCuoCGTEUXVKQCSSj6yCrBtgFjjFghN8Lz
&gt;&gt;2260529Fuck, it didn&#039;t. I guess I&#039;m boned. There&#039;s this if it means anything.
For the record you guys have no memoryI was looking at an archived thread on another board from Dec 2016, and when I went to biz it was still from that timeframe.I saw only one or two threads on crypto in the first few pages, the board was mostly about normie stocks and actual financial advice and shitI expect apologies
What counts as &quot;actual financial advice&quot;?
&gt;&gt;2260361People asking about household budgets, what to do with certain amounts of money and not just getting shilled the latest shitcoin, etc
&gt;&gt;2260341What went so horribly right?
&gt;&gt;2260341This board refills with entirely new first-time newfags about every 3 weeks. It&#039;s fucking astounding. I come here to shill PnDs for this reason, because they never fucking remember shit so they keep falling for it over and over again.
&gt;&gt;2260341oldfag hereI remember MGT
It took me three years to get here. Where do I go from here? How do I make this grow?
&gt;&gt;2260073dump it all into Mooncoin is the only answer
&gt;&gt;2260073go all-in on Blocknetretire in 2 years
&gt;&gt;2260073DGB if you want 50K to be 500K in a few short months(year)
Is all your money lazy or do you have more working somewhere?Banks are useless, put it into something that offers a return.
&gt;&gt;2260073If you would have buying cryptos during these 3 years, just say only BTC and ETH you will be probably x10 now.
&gt;&gt;2260073The banks are laughing at you keeping that much money in their accounts
&gt;&gt;2260112It&#039;s all my money. I have no fucking clue where to put it that offers a return.
&gt;&gt;2260137Any suggestions? Got a Schwab account, should I throw some in an ETF or something?
&gt;&gt;2260132&gt;x10that&#039;s really kind of you not wanting OP to hang himself, but the truth is if he had been buying btc &amp; eth over the past 3 years he&#039;d have more than 100x that.
&gt;&gt;2260144If you can&#039;t be bothered dealing with it just put it in a managed fund. If you know more than the average person on any given industry then trading yourself is a solid option.All I really know about is computers but that makes trading AMD, Intel, nVidia ect. easy.If you have never had any investments your best option is to talk to an accountant instead of a chinese cartoon forum.
&gt;&gt;2260158&gt;make bittrex account, buy bitcoins with half of the money&gt;hold 50% in bitcoin, 25% in eth and spread the rest in various shitcoins&gt;hold for weeks/months/years&gt;profitwith the other 50% of your fiat buy physical gold and silver as preparation for a possible crash/racewar/you name it.if nothing happens, these metals will increase steady in value as time goes by, because of fiat inflation.u can thank me later when we meet in lamboland.
&gt;&gt;2260086kek 3 years of this guy&#039;s work down the drain in 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt;2260273&gt;still using buttcoin instead of ETHMaybe you misunderstood OP&#039;s goals?
&gt;&gt;2260073&gt;1%
&gt;49k in your checkings accountJust...why?
&gt;&gt;2260350Lets see your savings account rates
&gt;&gt;2260390Because I&#039;m an idiot that can&#039;t into bank accounts
&gt;&gt;2260209The thing is, I want to learn. I just ordered the intelligent investor and hope that would be a decent start
Just going to drop this there even though WAVES doesn&#039;t even need shilling. See ya on Lamboland guys
Just bought in hard at 3.9 :)
&gt;&gt;2258085good on ya
Glad I got in on this around 1$ :)
&gt;This or Factom?? :S
I seen this when it was 80 cents. I wanted to buy some but poor fag. Still want to buy some but still a poor fag. Anyone else know them feels?
&gt;&gt;2258723Both my picks also mate, cheersI like BLOCK too
&gt;&gt;2258772&gt;tfw too much of a pansy to even give exchanges your information.I&#039;ve been looking at waves for months, too bad I have no fucking coins and have to jump through hoops to get my money in from Canada.
&gt;&gt;2258039&gt;sold 5 waves to buy 5 waves when it dipsIT NEVER DIPSpic related
&gt;&gt;2259371Yeah, I was waiting it to return to 2 and now it&#039;s close to 5, fuck me.
Bancor will ass rape waves to death
&gt;check wallet&gt;incoming transfer 250.000&gt;it never arrived&gt;mfw someone almost gave me a total of $1000What the fuck, I&#039;m scared of something shady in my wallet now, how I add more security to my shitty account?
&gt;&gt;2259446Maybe... still time to make some satoshi here in the meantime. get the fuck on the train.. make some profit and then jump to the next one. it&#039;s not about who&#039;s mom sucks cock best, it is about the fact that all of your moms sucked cock well at some point.
&gt;&gt;2259446&gt;Implying you wont get cucked at the ico by the whales.Lmfao.
&gt;&gt;2259446so salty
&gt;&gt;2259369Try to buy bitcoins on localbitcoins, most sellers there don&#039;t ask you for ID.
It&#039;s clear by now that the cryptomarket is literally a gold mine that can make you rich in a matter of months or even weeks, even with a small initial investment. However, we all know that not everyone is going to make it. In fact, the majority will probably fall, while only a few will rise as millionaires. Now, what what differentiates the people making It and the ones failing? You could say big money, which is fair enough, but it&#039;s not just that, it&#039;s easy to make money when you are already rich, but what about the people that aren&#039;t? The only thing that will give you the edge over others is knowledge. Only with knowledge and by seeing different perspectives and sides you will be able to see what others don&#039;t to invest in the promised coin before everyone else.The purpose of this thread, and hopefully general in the future, is to gather all the intellectuals from /biz/ to form a think tank, where will discuss what are the best coins to invest, why we think they are good to invest and why other coins were successful in the past so that we can get a better picture of the future. You may think you are smart and has more knowledge than others, but no one can&#039;t envision all the different perspectives at the same time, they need others challenging them for that.Discussing shit altcoins, why they are shit and why other shitcoins failed is also acceptable, as it will help us see signs of future altcoins being shit.So, which one is the new Stratis /biz/? Let&#039;s think and grab that ticket to lamboland.
&gt;&gt;2260281most people will cash out before the 1%the 1% that dont cash out will be the millionaires
&gt;&gt;2260281Did you read the Bancor paper nigger?
&gt;&gt;2260335Bancor has potential and I will put money on it sure, but I doubt it will make as much money as Stratis. Not because the idea isn&#039;t promising, but due to the initial market cap of it compared to Straits.Still, it&#039;s the new ICO that I have most interest in right now.
&gt;&gt;2260281I&#039;ll throw you a bone because you sound poor and that makes me sad, kind of. Look into, &quot;IOTA&quot;. It&#039;s not about finding the best coin, it&#039;s about investing in the best use of blockchain.
Whats the deal with litecoin? Is it stuck in the 20 dollar range forever or will it make gains?
&gt;&gt;2259036accumulation phase lol, it was at 30 last friday
&gt;&gt;2259036soon the litecoin will have his daysoon
&gt;&gt;2259036get out now, look at its 1 week chart of ltc/btc
I&#039;m surprised LTC survived so long after the launch of Scrypt ASIICs It&#039;s only innovation was stopping ASIICs and that didn&#039;t last long. Now with the new tech they are adding it actually has a purpose again but I still don&#039;t think it justifies the current price.
&gt;&gt;2259036crypto pro here. been in the game over 20 years. here&#039;s how you acquire lambos:&gt;open bittrex or whatever jew exchange you use&gt;invest in every coin with red font in the &#039;% change&#039; column (this includes litecoin atm)&gt;set sell orders at +5% current value&gt;close bittrex&gt;repeat every day for one year. this is your &#039;job&#039;
as normies keep adopting bitcoin more and more they will eventually get more comfortable with the idea of altcoinslitecoin is a simple concept to wrap your head around, the silver to bitcoin&#039;s goldthis will see gains one day
&gt;&gt;2259069I can&#039;t see normies getting excited about trading on a coin when it&#039;s price history is the inverse of BTC. It&#039;s been steadily going down for 3 years.
&gt;&gt;2259105a little pump is all it will take
&gt;&gt;2259115Look at the 3 year chart, it isn&#039;t like it hasn&#039;t been pumped multiple times.
&gt;&gt;2259135we are in a new age of crypto now thoughthe normie adoption era
&gt;&gt;2259138Which altcoins will survive this era?
&gt;&gt;2259138That is true but it also raises an important question, how bad to we fleece them? If we fleece every normalfag that trades then it hurts crypto as a whole but it&#039;s also very tempting to keep making money.I sold at the peak on both HUC and XPM a couple of hours ago and I know that only reason I could was newbs were stupid enough to buy.
&gt;&gt;2259115I always like what spin has to contribute to the board. Never leave /biz/ spin. Btw what do you think about Stratis?
&gt;&gt;2259176nobody can be surebut I think LTC is a pretty safe guess
&gt;&gt;2259204thanks magnet thats a fuckin sweet trip you got
&gt;&gt;2259204oh and I dont really know too much about STRAT right now other than the fact its been climbing hard this week
&gt;&gt;2259036ill just leave this here. already bought in for 23 btc. You should do the same if you dont hate being poor.another good guess is ripple. it is reboucning already and will hit ATH in 3 Days.
&gt;&gt;2259050LTC is fast, fair mining and well distributed with no whales. Its the silver but alt-coins took some of its value in the process.
&gt;&gt;2259204&gt;top dev team&gt;great whitepaper&gt;climbing steadySTRAT is a top-tier coin. Long-hold.
bumb nc rocket might fuel up right now
&gt;&gt;2259036BUY nao, it will make another another pump sometime in the next 12h
&gt;&gt;2259396sell walls are dropping by the minute, check poloniex...
&gt;talking to a triptard
&gt;&gt;2259448
Seems like substance can be inserted.Ltc is btc. It is very similar in code and therefore merchants can switch very easily. (Yours.com switched and stated they needed to change 2 lines of code) however it got hated on for being a copy cat although it was already slightly better then big bro (4 times as fast, 4 times the capacity, higher security.Enter bitcoins stalemate. Litecoin adds segwit, bitcoin community still bitching. All cool projects intended for post segwit bitcoin are about to hit litecoin. The lightning network (instant transactions) MAST (smart contracts), tumblebit (anonimity), etc etc.Its the most logical step to go to from bitcoin. I&#039;m just waiting till the market figured that out.Came from 0.003 btc to 0.011 but still a while away from 0.052 ATH destined to be broken.LTC, BTC and ETH will be the main coins when all is said and done.
Drop that trip off.
&gt;&gt;2259209Agreed here. LTC is looking younger and more nimble than BTC. Big boy seems to be aging poorly and we all know the banks and Jews are fucking BTC now. get on LTC while the train is starting IMO
&gt;&gt;2259463Bitcoin is Coca-Cola, It can&#039;t be replaced by Pepsi.The Intergalactic Quantum proof blockchain is the only thing that stands a chance
&gt;&gt;2259507saved
&gt;&gt;2259507I&#039;d be laughing all the way to my hardware wallet if Litecoin becomes as big compared to bitcoin as pepsi is to coca.
&gt;&gt;2259261Looks like I&#039;ll save my ripple for another week, I was about to sell some to buy more STRAT
&gt;&gt;2259545
I have always liked LTCI am not sure why
&gt;&gt;2259036right now all the major coins are losing volume as people are bringing new money to altcoinslitecoin still remains in the $27-29 rangeit grows $1-$2 a weekby July 1st it will be $31-$35unless more new money comes in to help it move up fasterthe same is happening with bitcoin &amp; ethereumthey went up really high but the volume is loweringwhich means new money isn&#039;t coming in as fast as it was in Maythey are slowing down and will eventually only grow $5-$10 week or as low as litecoin does
LTC is owned by the chinese (they have the largest stake in it 65%) and the chinese have really strong hands due to their government.LTC isn&#039;t going nowhere.
&gt;&gt;2259682LTC is going up up up
Litecoin is the WHORE of cryptocurrencies. It sucks and takes everything.
I bought it at $23 and I plan on selling off at like $35 when it hits that around Thursday of next week.
&gt;&gt;2259682&gt;strong hands due to their governmentany connection to china is a huge negative for any coin. at any point the chink gov can try and gain control over it or ban it completely, just look at whats happening with bitmain. chinks can&#039;t be trusted.
&gt;&gt;2259771I thought the Chinks had already banned all crypto and it was just the fact that it can&#039;t be stopped that keeps them going?
&gt;&gt;2259064Really?andWhat do you mean by &quot;invest in every coin with red font in the &#039;% change&#039; column &quot;I dont understand
&gt;&gt;2259771&gt;&gt;2259785i did a recaculation55% - CNYif they gain control or ban it completelythe chinese are screwedbut the money will still remain in LTCas they wont be able to withdraw lolor they can have a friend/family in the USA or elsewhere monitor the account and cash out when needed
&gt;&gt;2259825hes saying buy the coins that are down on the daythe ones that have just fallen in price
&gt;&gt;2259771What happened with bitmain? Their sales have still been pretty strong. The new L3+ is one of the best litecoin mining rigs out there.
&gt;&gt;2259834cheersseems a simple approach. bullshit?
&gt;&gt;2259825What if There is zero volume. Do you still buy?
&gt;&gt;2259861a bit too simplistic but at least hes telling you to buy low and sell higher
&gt;&gt;2259898kek yeah
&gt;&gt;2259887Stupd question. Zero volume means its under maintenance
&gt;&gt;2259845their ties to many mining companies and shady goings on with their &quot;ceo&quot; trying to take control of bitcoin to make more money at the expense of users, or just because the chinese gov are breathing down his neck and this is his way out.
&gt;&gt;2259064&gt;been in the game over 20 years.he actually got a &gt;you
Dammit you guys already driving up the price. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2259039What does that mean?
&gt;&gt;2259825buy everything that is down. or lost percentage. Jesus kids. Buy low sell high
Hey /biz/ I&#039;m a new coiner and so far just have ETH and BTC but have made great gains and want to diversify for more short term gains. If you had to start over right now with $2,000 what would you invest in? Was thinking some of these coinsSTRATGNTDGBXBYUBQalso maybe BLOCK EDG and WAVES
&gt;&gt;2260272wait till monday.nearly every shitcoin is pumped as we speak and many are @ their ath.on monday u can buy the dip and enjoy some serious gains.the coins u listed are perfectly fine for this.
&gt;&gt;2260295do this, ignore shills
&gt;&gt;2260295do prices usually fall on monday? or something is gonna happen this specific monday?
&gt;&gt;2260295thanks appreciate it. any thoughts on how to split ? equal into all coins listed or exclude some? was thinking $800 strat $200 the other 4 $100 the other 3
&gt;&gt;2260272XBY == new moon on Mondayhttps://youtu.be/m3a4OTh2Y8w
What should your ratio between ETH/BTC be in your portfolio? 60% ETH/40% BTC? BTC seems a bit unstable right now with scalability issues and disagreements among the community. I am worried about a hard fork that will tank the price of BTC but on the other end I have FOMO that BTC will hit $10k by the end of the year. What are your thoughts /biz/?
rn have 100% ETHbut I think my plan is&gt; 70 ETH&gt; 10 BTC&gt; 20 SHITCOINS
&gt;&gt;2260179&gt;This ratio shit againFOR THE LAST GODDAMN TIME STOP HOLDING BTC.BTC is shit and is going down. ETH is going up and replacing it. Get that through your fucking head you deluded faggot.BTC is shit now in every way.
Was 100/0 eth/btc a couple days ago, slowly moved to 20/80.
&gt;&gt;2260212Obviously their will be one coin that dominates the market, and I&#039;m leaning more towards ETH. But it&#039;s not like one coin will have a huge monopoly over other coins. There will be a few coins that are seen as the top dogs. It is still a good idea to diversify and not have 100% in ETH.
sell all your ETH for BTC, it will be worthless in a weekscreencap this and check em
I want to be a successful businessman with something OTHER than trading fake money to losers on the internet. What are some recommended books on the subject?
Silence.
&gt;&gt;2260229The same could be said about stock trading. Are you retarded OP?
&gt;&gt;2260441His choice of picture should have informed you on that.
&gt;&gt;2260441The same could be said about fucking real estate even
&gt;&gt;2260455How can real estate be real if our money isn&#039;t real, you feelin me?
&gt;&gt;2260441&gt;&gt;2260453&gt;&gt;2260455&gt;&gt;2260461:0)
You guys ever notice how every single coin on Poloniex (that wasn&#039;t delisted) is worth more now than it was exactly 1 month ago?Does this always happen? I think literally every coin.Are you going to make significant money just holding literally fucking anything for a month&#039;s time as long as it&#039;s on Poloniex and isn&#039;t delisted?Or was this just a very, very good month and doesn&#039;t happen every time...?
WHO CARES LOL ITS FREE MONEY
There is more money flowing into crypto from literally the entire world. all coins will continue to go up for the foreseeable future.
There&#039;s fresh money being pumped daily into the [whatever you wanna call it].
&gt;&gt;2260274&gt;&gt;2260283&gt;&gt;2260287My point is, does it really not matter which coins you buy (on Poloniex. Some of the stuff on Bittrex just tanks and most of the stuff on smaller exchanges goes to hell as well) ? Does which coin you buy simply not matter?Also the charts I looked at were in BTC, so that means BTC was more or less one of the worst investments on Poloniex to hold for this month.
&gt;&gt;2260334&gt;Does which coin you buy simply not matter?It only matters that whales accumulate, pump and get attention.
&gt;&gt;2260347But they do this for every single coin on there, so in the end &quot;buy and hold&quot; works in a 30-day time frame no matter what coin it is.I want to know if you guys think this will carry into next month as well and if it&#039;s normal.
&gt;&gt;2260376yes but the name of the game is to find that one coin b4 it hits polonix, that one coin worth 1/1000 of a cent n u buy 1million of it n thn u get ur ticket ot lambo land
&gt;&gt;2260376my guess is that this is a good strategy for the top 20 to 30 coins. Will it there be a shitton of volatility in the near term? Yes. Is crypto going to keep going uplong term? Yes.
&gt;&gt;2260251basically yes.bittrex screenshot from now - pic relatedgain/loose ratio in general is amazing!what a time to be alive and join a bubble at its beginning/mid phase.
&gt;&gt;2260334i buy every shitcoin shilled here and stuff i find myself when its red and tanking.i look for volume and marketcap, general sell/buy trends, price development since start and thats it.i hold like 25 shitcoins so far. with 50-200 bucks in each of them.btc and eth as base currency.
&gt;&gt;2260376Why limit yourself to long term gains? Buy high sell low. It&#039;s like riding a wave on top of a wave on top of a wave.
&gt;&gt;2260251Yes but the average return has only 100% on your USD per month.
&gt;&gt;2260440Sadly I don&#039;t even make average on it because I don&#039;t invest all my money in this, but a decent percentage of it. I&#039;ve just about doubled my money but I&#039;ve been doing this since March so that&#039;s kind of pathetic of me.
&gt;&gt;2260452On the bright side stock market normies get 5 - 10% per YEAR.
&gt;&gt;2260471I know but I spend all day here so I don&#039;t make that kind of comparison any more.My issue is I kept thinking things were gonna crash so I put in small amounts of money and was too cautious, as a result of getting fucked by /biz/ PnDs the first 2 weeks cause I was an idiot. I had no idea that by simply holding onto the coins that I thought had ruined me the first 2 weeks that they actually would surpass their previous heights within a month.Now I want to vest more of my portfolio into just crypto, but I&#039;m afraid as soon as I put more in there&#039;s gonna be a crash like 2014.
anons, post your 1W total charts
I started less than 2 weeks ago
Feels good after dumping my Piece of Shit Wallet coin, it&#039;s all been uphill since then.
Getting there, almost one month of trading fake money started out with 1k
Poorfag reporting in.
&gt;&gt;2258075you need more zeroes, anon!
Done alright.
Bought some BAT, now just waiting for my million dollars...
&gt;&gt;2259517Not buying your overpriced bags whale.
&gt;&gt;2259517&gt;bought at 7x ICOYou already failed, moron.
where the fuck do you buy BAT?
&gt;&gt;2259572liqui.io
&gt;&gt;2259517did you buy 1 million BAT?
&gt;&gt;2259572You dont if youre not a retard
&gt;&gt;2259517OP, if it means anything to youI won&#039;t be putting any of my money near that project and I will be telling everyone I ever come in contact with not to put their money in that scam.
&gt;&gt;2259557Do your research, the whales are some investing companies supporting BAT, dumb faggot. Have fun in poorfag land
&gt;Thinking paying people to view advertisements will deliver meaningful exposure to target audiencesFucking KEK, this thing a lead balloon.
I&#039;m gonna laugh so fucking hard later when i remember you guys... same shit i had when eth came out
&gt;&gt;2259645You&#039;re just too new to know how ICOs work. You either buy at ICO or you buy the dip after the quick profit guys cash out. You are one of the idiots that bought in between both of those.
&gt;&gt;2259700&gt;Thinking that this will dip below the current price, ever.Funny.
&gt;&gt;2260490You&#039;re going to learn the hard way.
This was listed as a potential Coinbase candidate along with Golem and REP.Why doesn&#039;t /biz/ shill this. Shouldn&#039;t it moon in theory?
Shhhh
&gt;&gt;2259489shut the fuck up
&gt;&gt;2259546What&#039;s the coin supply for this? I may just buy in on it in-case it moons over summer.
&gt;he isn&#039;t quietly accumulating ANTbaka desu
Should I buy this, Golem, or XRP for best short term gains? I currently have ETH and ETC?
dont buy ANT or golem for short term gains. I have big bags of both and they dont go up much
&gt;&gt;2259741ANT has a promising team, has barely gone up since ICO and will inevitably moon when added to major exchanges.
&gt;&gt;2259741golem is up 24% from 7 days ago.
&gt;&gt;2259489stfu retard!&gt;sage
&gt;&gt;2259721Golem has being pretty disappointing so far imo, it doesn&#039;t even grow steady and slowly, it just sits around $0.35-$0.50 eternally. Also, I don&#039;t think ETH will rise now, maybe in the future.
&gt;&gt;2259791In crypto time that 1 year tho
BYTEBALL IS FOR FUCKING NOCOINERS. GET SOME REAL COIN LIKE $STRAT IDIOTS.
Why aren&#039;t you investing in the savior of the white race?
&gt;&gt;2258475&gt;implying i&#039;m not sprouting 2 mil right now
&gt;&gt;2258475I need a quick rundown on this memebean shit. Actually, no. I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t give a fuck. Fuck off while I wait for Sia and DGB to dip so I can buy in.
&gt;&gt;2259025Lol nobeaner faget keep waiting for those dips when you could have bought the bean dip
&gt;&gt;2258475
&gt;&gt;2258475I did, but his staff told me that my contribution doesn&#039;t include White House access.
&gt;&gt;2258475bean memes are my favorite
I make bad investments at least with the original intention making a good investment.
&gt;&gt;2258475Stay poor nobeaners
Ok, lets say you guys made money, 200K - 1 million from your Crypto.How will you safely withdraw that amount of money safely into your normal bank account?I&#039;m using YoBit, OKpay and HSBC.Whats the best way of doing it without having to pay (a lot of) tax?
Does anyone here actually make money or are you just LARPing
&gt;&gt;2258875Maybe Bitfinex if you are American? But I really don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just guessing. I hope you actually have this problem.There is also Localbitcoins, maybe someone wants to but that much.
Crypto gains are tax free in Scandinavia &lt;3
&gt;&gt;2258950I can verify that there are people on here who have made 50k+, but I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ve cashed out
Pay tax accountant to tell me the best option. If all else fails I can do a monthly transfer under $10k without alarms going off.
&gt;&gt;2258875you cant.you just need to spend it on vidya or something
i have about a million, im just going to move to a nice low-tax country to open a bank and then travel around without the IRS knowing shit
Buy a shit tonne of tech (iphones, laptops), and then sell them to get cash.
&gt;&gt;2259965Proof?
&gt;&gt;2258950Selling through local bitcoins then buy everything with just the cash for the rest of your life or offshore bank accounts. If you&#039;ve made enough, move out of the country.
&gt;&gt;2258875Or just fucking lie if the money is small enough. Say it&#039;s a gift or you found it ffs it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s small.Or simply buy in through Coinbase but cash out through Tether. Maybe you have to pay &quot;gift tax&quot; it doesn&#039;t really fucking matter.
&gt;&gt;2258875You can do &lt;$1200 through a bitcoin atm several times a month, but you&#039;re paying 10-15% there and running the risk of getting caught not paying taxes.Honestly just pay the taxes. There was a guide posted on reddit a while ago about how to use XMR to avoid paying any taxes, but I can&#039;t bother to find it.
&gt;&gt;2258875Send it to me. I live in a fiscal paradise, so in a matter of days you will have a credit card with 95% of your money. You will be listed a consultant working for my company.&gt;Its not a crime to use company money for personal uses hereSo even if you go full retard burning the card in less than a week, IRS can&#039;t persecute you nor link the company assets and funds as your initial money.My gains? The 5%.gm.wilfredo@gmail.com
&gt;&gt;2258950some guy on here bought 9.8mil xby about a month ago and showed a screenshot of his walletif he held he has over $350,000
I live with my parents and I don&#039;t know how tax workshelp
How much are you taxed on your earnings if you live in a no income tax state?Do you just pay whatever the federal bracket you fall under, or are you taxed for every transaction you make?
&gt;&gt;2260242Also, how much does it cost to exchange your BTC to USD?Who&#039;s the cheapest?Not looking to fuck the taxman, don&#039;t want that trouble, but don&#039;t want to get fucked in fees.Anyone know?
&gt;&gt;2259942I know Finland isn&#039;t in Scandinavia but just to let all the Finns here know: Crypto gains are NOT tax free in Finland.
&gt;locate Bitcoin ATM&gt;Get cash for bitcoins&gt;Buy Amazon gift cards with cash
&gt;&gt;2259942yeah but the problem is you have to live in Scandinavia. Yuck.
&gt;&gt;2258875&gt;200k-1 mil on yoshitWEW. Don&#039;t leave it on there too long or you&#039;ll be paying for blacksmiths new lambo.
&gt;&gt;2260168Do you honestly think someone will just give you 100,000$ worth of crypto?
What do you put your money into when BTC contracts
&gt;&gt;2259625LTC or ETHThey&#039;re the only two you can buy with fiat.A lot of the other alt coins you need to buy with BTC.
lambos
100,000% ROI in one fucking year. If you put $1,000 into this and held you&#039;d be a millionaire right now and it shows no signs of stopping. What&#039;s everyone&#039;s price projections for this by year&#039;s end?
Rule 1 about StratisYou don&#039;t talk about Stratis
&gt;&gt;2259098congratz all iron handswell deserved
Probably gonna ETH. Especially when it hits Coinbase.
What app is that you&#039;re using?
So where can I buy this?
getting sick of this coin. its literally made by a black man, and im convinced its being artificially propped up by Black Lives Matter
Still can&#039;t figure out the value of this coin in the middle of all the marketing buzzwords they use. Congrats on those who took a chance and held.

Bought in at .55
Coin was literally $5.20 yesterday and now its over $8... I was so close to buying yesterday but thought it would drop. Hopefully it corrects soon.
&gt;&gt;2259459Same.Hopefully I was able to catch the UBQ trainAlso got some ARK
&gt;&gt;2259459Yesterday was the dip, I bought two days ago at around $5.50.
I really suck at trying to sell high and buy low.&gt;Hold It&gt;It keeps going up&gt;Now is probably gonna dip, I will sell to buy the dip&gt;Sell&gt;Waits&gt;Wait&gt;Dip doesn&#039;t come&gt;Gets desperate because I think it will keep going up&gt;Buy higher than I sold like a idiotHow do I make this stop
&gt;&gt;2259499Looks like I missed it.. Might buy some now and wait to buy more then&gt;&gt;2259488Never heard of UBQ, does it seem promising?
This thing and Ubiq are top 5 quality coins desu.BTC/ETH/STRAT/UBQ/ and unfortunately XRP
&gt;&gt;2259592&gt;BTC&gt;top 5 quality coinsNot unless they fix their shit, if they don&#039;t get their act together they&#039;ll fall out of the top 5 within two years.

&gt;&gt;2259417&gt;Still can&#039;t figure out the value of this coin in the middle of all the marketing buzzwords they use. Congrats on those who took a chance and held.It&#039;s on Ethereum but the programming language is C++ (shit ton of people use) and not Solidarity (not many people use). They plan on adding Javascript at the end of the year. So, it is much easier for the masses to build Dapps on it versus basic Ethereum. They have a sweet ass wallet coming soon to which is targeted to bitcoin and blockchain annonimity.https://stratisplatform.com/2017/03/02/stratis-breeze-wallet-redefines-financial-privacy-for-blockchains/Keep up with their roadmaphttps://stratisplatform.com/tag/roadmap/
&gt;&gt;2259098hey uh can u do me a favor?can u shutup about this coin? thanks
So what&#039;s the next Stratis? Will we say 100,000% again for a legit, non-PND coin?
Fuck niggercoin
&gt;&gt;2259098What website is that?
is it too late to buy stratis?
&gt;&gt;2259713Jesus fucking christ, its C# and Solidity you inbred mouthbreather.To put this simply: in ETH you code in solidity, which is a language developed with smart contract, blockchains and all those buzzwords in mind. On STRATIS you code in C# which is a much more broadly used language and whatever you write runs in a .NET framework.So, STRATIS is easier to use, ETH is faster.
&gt;&gt;2259897Did you really fucking expect anyone on this website to say anything besides &quot;No buy MORE!&quot; when you asked that? Really?
&gt;&gt;2259897It was too late to buy ETH when it was around that price?
1/10 of what it is nowIt&#039;s LTC all over again, stupid faggots lumping on shit because they missed the Real Deal
&gt;&gt;2259917&gt;STRATIS is easier to useonly for pajeet street-shitterstakes all of a lazy afternoon for a decent coder to learn a new language
&gt;&gt;2259992Stratis is barely at the beginning of the roadmap and may very well be a top 3 coin within a year.It rivals ETH, Litecoin was merely a technology playground.
&gt;&gt;2260029Vast majority of companies use C#Also, Stratis is PoS, Segwit ready, is easier to build dapps around and actually will actually have a true anonymous wallet.
&gt;&gt;2260042You&#039;re right, strat isn&#039;t LTC, it&#039;s DOGEEth was build from the ground up to be a smart contract platform, even if it were never to evolve, it would still be light-years beyond stratis&#039; wildest imagination
&gt;&gt;2260083What ETH can do that Stratis can&#039;t?Go on, I&#039;ll wait.
&gt;&gt;2260091be faster than stratis
&gt;&gt;2260091Not be shit.
&gt;&gt;2260123Someone is really salty because he didn&#039;t get in ealier. Don&#039;t worry anon, there&#039;s always a shit PnD altcoin for you to invest.
&gt;&gt;2260115How so? ETH&#039;s smart contracts bloat the blockchain because they all in the mainchain, while Stratis avoids that by running its dapps on sidechains.
&gt;&gt;2259917&gt;Jesus fucking christ, its C# and Solidity you inbred mouthbreather.Whatever. Just glad I sold 15 ETH 2 days ago and got on the Stratis train. And us non tech fags are who is flooding the market with $ so eat a dick and enjoy the total market cap expanding code fag.
&gt;&gt;2260115Having made transfers with both I can state that this is false.
&gt;&gt;2260140Nigger, I got in on Eth when it was less than a buck, you think I give a fuck I didn&#039;t ride a shitcoin to the top-10?Strat will takes it&#039;s place with MAID and XLM and all the other pretenders soon enough
&gt;&gt;2260206&gt;a blockchain no one uses is faster than the number 2shocking

&gt;&gt;2260324You&#039;re doing something very wrong then as crypto naturally rises regardless. Unless this is a falseflag nocoiner thread.
&gt;&gt;2260324tell us anon, what and how much of it did u specifically buy?
&gt;&gt;226034580% BTC10% ETH4% STRAT3% REP3% GNT
&gt;&gt;2260324YOU JUST HAD TO HODLstop day trading

&gt;&gt;2260356Sell your Bitcoins, put it into Stratis.Thank me later.
SIACOIN IS MOONING
&gt;&gt;2258107The best thing is SIA will have something akin to &quot;proof of burn&quot; meaning max coin supply might get reduced.
&gt;&gt;2258107HOLY FUCKING SHIT I CHECK AND THIS SHIT IS OVER 400 SATOSHIS
&gt;&gt;2258114&gt;The best thing is SIA will have something akin to &quot;proof of burn&quot; meaning max coin supply might get reduced.It would be fucking awesome.
&gt;&gt;2259683From what I understood; coins will get removed from max supply when you use them and at the same time people hosting their storage will keep mining new coins. That would make a very balanced economy in my opinion. How the fuck did I just only find about this coin now? I&#039;m only concerned about ARK/SHIFT. IPFS is pretty good too.
&gt;&gt;2259672That&#039;s just the beginning anonkun
Some of you faggots are alright, dont not buy monero tomorrow

Cool it&#039;s another Larping thread
do you tell your friends or family about your gains?I made over a quarter mill this year and still work at a family business, and my uncle is a douche bag to me thinking I&#039;m a poorfag.I&#039;m tempted to tell him and watch his head explode.He&#039;s terrible with investments, acts like he&#039;s rich while bugging my uncles/dad for more money because he&#039;s in over his head in house payments, country club, and circles he runs with.I want to put him in his place
&gt;&gt;2254844&gt;my uncle
&gt;&gt;2254844Just 4 months more, and show him the gorillion
&gt;&gt;2254844not him, but I averaged 1000 a day this month. I&#039;ve told two people - a supervisor and a good friend. the good friend also does crypto shit, and my supervisor at work because it was pertinent to the discussion at hand.
&gt;&gt;2254844It&#039;s not worth the anonymous tip to the IRS he might put in or whatever else once he knows that. You should work to change your situation and get a different job if he is actually abusive to you but it&#039;s not smart to tell people unless you need to. Just my opinion
&gt;&gt;2254870thanks anon that&#039;s a great answer
&gt;&gt;2254836I should buy what today?
&gt;&gt;2254844&gt;He&#039;s terrible with investments, acts like he&#039;s rich while bugging my uncles/dad for more money because he&#039;s in over his head in house payments, country club, and circles he runs withDon&#039;t tell him until after you&#039;re out of there, otherwise he&#039;s going to start hassling the shit out of you for a loan.
&gt;&gt;2254844&gt;country clubthat is so 90s. the fuck is wrong with him.rich people dont do that anymore
&gt;&gt;2254844dont tell him if hes terrible with investments. family expect money from each other
Few questions: How much money do you put into a trade on average? How long are your trades usually open? Do you use leverage? If you&#039;re losing on a trade do you cut your losses or tend to hold?
i tried to day trade once.i panic bought and lost 1.5 ethereum
&gt;&gt;2254844If you tell him he is only going to treat you worse, if anything he will ask for money and maybe even stop paying you or fire you.Once you disclose you have over 100k, everyone will either be with you or against you. Remember many normies can barely save 10 grand on their savings account.
&gt;&gt;2254867What was your initial investment?
&gt;&gt;2254926I get that vibe, I did tell one friend and we are tight.He has taken me on trips to his lakehouse when I was an addict at my worst. To baseball games when I couldn&#039;t afford shit.Last night I bought 2 front row stanley cup tickets and took him. My life is turning around around and things are changing I just want to keep everything straight.
Where do you even start?
&gt;&gt;2254815Best tip for consistently good trades?
Bro, don&#039;t tell him shit until you are ready to take a shit on his desk and walk out forever
&gt;&gt;2254982research and hodlI held bitcoin for a long time, and bought into LTC when segwit was being put through, sold most of it back to bitcoin after that.
&gt;&gt;2255004haha sounds good to me
&gt;tfw I graduated college last year&gt;took a year off to study for mcat and work on resume for medical school&gt;decided to go into crypto using my scribe money, while I watch my friends burn cash at Coachella, Raves, Clubbing&gt;Managed to catch Eth @ 16, Strat @ .55, IOC @ .35, GNT @ ICO, and RLC @ .25&gt;I&#039;m at a pace to able to pay for medical school.&gt;Friends now messaging me for advice, decide to charge them for my time to give advice (that can be found at /biz/ or other shit)&gt;I feel like a jew, but it gives me an excuse to stop scribing and soley focus on the MCAT while I still make money.&gt;Me rite now
So what&#039;s your crypto advice cryptorich anon... help us escape our chains insha Kek
&gt;&gt;2255007&gt;&gt;2255015And your next growth allocations? If you did well consistently you must have developed a decent intuition.
&gt;&gt;2254836Why XEM? I always thought it was interesting but its charts don&#039;t look so good
Bought XEM based on your post. Carry me to riches whale.
&gt;&gt;2254844sounds fun, but i imagine it would just bite you in the ass hard laterjust let him continue being a douche, and go live a good life
What exchange do you guys like... no shill pls
&gt;&gt;2254982Don&#039;t expect consistently good trades you fucking coward.
&gt;&gt;2255018lol nice dude keep it up that&#039;s great&gt;&gt;2255024I have 95% in btc 5% in ltc, but I need to research for what is next. I was content on earning through loans to margin traders with 1/3 of my funds, but sometimes I worry about bitcoin&#039;s issues.Like I said research is the best bet, there is something out there that is going to be the best option. Just read everyday, if bitcoin comes to a consensus I think they will stay at the top, but there will always be underdogs that have something about them that will present an opportunity.
&gt;&gt;2254967
&gt;&gt;2255244What&#039;s the case for LTC? I&#039;m 95% in BTC and 5% in ETH.

Explain to me how billions of people across the world put up with working a 9 to 5 or working for a boss?How hasn&#039;t there been a complete makeover of this bullshit yet? Everyone just seems to accept that they&#039;re going to go to work five days a week at forty hours until they&#039;re close to death?Like??????
&gt;&gt;2245076You have to eat. People are brainwashed and retards.
Yes, the mental health system scoops them up, meds them up, and sends them back to work
easythey were idiots and procreated
&gt;&gt;2245083It&#039;s fucking baffling, honestlyHow fucked is our world that we are absolutely required to work for some faggot to survive?
&gt;&gt;2245106&gt;absolutely requiredThat&#039;s where you&#039;re wrong, kiddoUse your brain and show your worth. Slaves have a slavish nature. Do you want something more?
&gt;&gt;2245106You are always required to work, often for someone that is smarter and more capable of doing a higher level of management than you are.What should you be having a problem with is how boomers and the state somehow managed to destroy the greatest boom in economic productivity in less than one generation
&gt;&gt;2245117Do you, waggie?
&gt;&gt;2245117For a majority of people, it&#039;s right though.Sure, you can break off and do your own thing like start a business or something but how many people are going to be successful doing so?Of course I want something more. Everyone on this board wants something more
&gt;&gt;2245106&gt;required
&gt;&gt;2245076You can apply this attitude to many things.Most people take the path of least resistance.Most people don&#039;t want to fuck about with Linux so they use Windows or Mac.Most people don&#039;t want to fuck about with the complexities of becoming an Entrepreneur, business owner or trader so they take the easy route.
&gt;&gt;2245129How often are you working for someone smarter instead of compared to someone who has been in your field longer or somebody who has more access to capital?
Sadly, you just get used to it.
&gt;&gt;2245086I am a corporate slave consultant. I make $162k a year and I hate my life. I did not spend 14 consecutive days in one time zone last calendar year (know this from doing taxes).I take amphetamines in the morning in order to function and then sleeping pills, alcohol, and the occasional marijuana if I&#039;m in Cali Colorado or Washington.Leaving my job June 30 with nothing else lined up.Couldn&#039;t be fucking happier. OP hit me right in the feels. Wage slavery is death.
&gt;&gt;2245148Good pointStill though, blame boomers for this
&gt;&gt;2245158At least you get to travelSitting in the same fucking office in the same fucking city day in and day out is fucking suicidal
No everyone is been build to start their own business.
&gt;&gt;2245158I&#039;m a consultant who never, ever gets to travel. It&#039;s fucking baffling, I know, because I love to travel and I hate this goddamn job. I&#039;m here to make enough money to be able to not have to work again and get out. Whatever helps me get there faster is good. That&#039;s all I know. If I decided to start a business, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do for people or how I&#039;d do it.Let&#039;s switch.
&gt;&gt;2245076going through all of highschool i always intended i would never go to post secondary because i knew nothing would change from my current situation but i have even been ridiculed and called a retard numerous times from people actually telling me to seriously go to college or something.whenever i asked them why or why they are going to they would never have an answer and just say something &quot;uhh because you have to&quot;. but it doesnt matter what my hops and dreams were or how i wanted to take a different path and even just live off a backpack or be a hippie because it was always the same thing their parents tell them to do, almost like you completely ignore who you are and finding out who you are when growing up
&gt;&gt;2245076Back when slavery was legal, the owners paid an inflation adjusted $40,000 for the slave&#039;s shelter, food, clothing. Now many years later the average income is just north of $40,000.&gt;Really ionizes my castor seeds
&gt;&gt;2245190&gt;&gt;2245209It&#039;s a trap prize. I average around 20 hours a week traveling, the constant change and inability to form routines is killer on the body. The only people over 25 who enjoy this work are people who are unhappy with their lives at home. Lots of my co-workers have affairs with each other3 years of living out of a suitcase so my bosses can make money is no way to live.
Pal, at least 90% of humanity is content with letting others be the lead. They just want their basic needs met, a little luxury now and then and above all else - stability. Knowing that on day X they&#039;ll receive X amount of money makes their life predictable and therefore the future less scary.Personally I&#039;m 50/50 on this topic. I&#039;ll be more than happy if I earn 150k/year in the future, plus I don&#039;t have to waste time a single thought on my job after leaving the office. But being an entrepreneur means working nonstop. As a lazyfag, this doesn&#039;t bode well with me.
&gt;&gt;2245240I know you say it but... I just wish I could do it.Assuming you&#039;re traveling to other countries I mean. If it&#039;s just the US I&#039;m not so sure.
&gt;&gt;2245076Questions:&gt;Explain to me how billions of people across the world put up with working a 9 to 5 or working for a boss?They are forced to by their circumstances. It is not a choice. Thus, no freedom.&gt;How hasn&#039;t there been a complete makeover of this bullshit yet?People are fearful that if other people weren&#039;t forced to work, they wouldn&#039;t have, or be be able to consume at their current or preferred level.Answer:&gt;Everyone just (((( accepts ))) that they&#039;re going to go to work five days a week at forty hours until they&#039;re close to death.Yes. Many people die before retirement, and many very soon after.
Lmao, 21 years old, never worked a day in my life, I am doing online business about to sell my website for $15kI am also in uni and I see all poorfags with eyebags crying how they have to save on food while I am eating take out everyday.LiterallyNeverWorkedThen again I have the personality for it, I accepted that if I fuck up financially and have to slave for the rest of my life in a cubicle I will take a shit ton of LSD, hop on a freeway and try to dodge as many cars as possible before crashing
&gt;&gt;2245321Nope purely domestic, put in around 200k miles a year because I have to do a ton of transcons. I&#039;ve got the highest status on American and JetBlue (only one level) so I get bumped up to first a lot but that&#039;s just a slight sliver lining.Work in a field that&#039;s heavily regulated by the government so no need for overseas travel.
&gt;&gt;2245361just swallow a bullet m8, nobody deserves to die for your mental retardation
The only thing that keeps me going is that im going to rob one of the directors of the company i work for.
&gt;&gt;2245373nobody deserves my scammy products yet I am living a dream. Have some chutzpah.
&gt;&gt;2245373&gt;&gt;2245377also&gt;putting LSD on every newschannel because you are a gutless shitbirdhave some decency for once
&gt;&gt;2245382out of the way bum, your breath smells ;)
&gt;&gt;2245361Woah, you&#039;re 21 and you&#039;ve never worked? That&#039;s unheard of
&gt;&gt;2245382now this is a quality postwe don&#039;t need to give the oppressive overlords any more ammo
&gt;&gt;2245384&gt;virgin neet with 20k networth playing rough on an anonymous imageboardlmaoing
&gt;&gt;2245076Yes some people like being productive
&gt;&gt;2245396chill dude
&gt;&gt;2245076Crypto is that makeover. Decentralized free markets for everything. There will no longer be corporations or even governments. Global anarcho-capitalism is the future.
&gt;&gt;2245076More and more people do not put up with it. They often end up on disability, on drugs. I see it everyday working in a property management company. Probably 60-70% or more of our units are rented to people on some form of support (ODSP, Ontario Works, etc). Most of them smoke, drink, and do drugs excessively. It&#039;s very sad to see an under-class grow and grow within your own city.People need to be apart of something bigger than themselves to live optimally. They need a job at the very LEAST, they need a family, and they need to engage with the larger community too. I&#039;m very afraid to see the outcome of UBI, something being experimented with in Ontario. Many seem optimistic, but I think we will see a class of people living hand-to-mouth on whatever the government will give them, and they will always vote to get more.If you&#039;re really bored or stressed by your job you are likely over or under qualified. You have to find an area where you can be relatively competent, but still challenged. People want to contribute and be productive and when that is taken away from them they become destructive.
&gt;&gt;2245406&gt;p-please my asshole is gapingk bb
&gt;&gt;2245240&gt;3 years of living out of a suitcase so my bosses can make money is no way to live.Brutal. At least you&#039;re a well paid slave. Hope you invest in crypto and have 3 mil in the bank.
&gt;&gt;2245106You must be trolling.You dont have to do shit you can go live on The side walk in Manhattan and never have to work a day in your, literally your dream and you deserve it kid. You should hurry up i saw a nice spot outside Penn station that was vacant.
&gt;&gt;2245575You literally know nothing about the world. Continue watching your anime and jerking off to 2D waifus please
&gt;&gt;2245630At least their more real than the bullshit I&#039;m reading on this fucking board.
&gt;&gt;2245076&gt; Implying that computers and automation didn&#039;t or aren&#039;t reinventing the way we work.Bro, we have already been unshackled. Just because you work a drive thru window doesn&#039;t mean the rest of us are stuck in the 19th century... You&#039;ve simply been left behind.
&gt;&gt;2245421&gt;smart post on /biz/&gt;no replyeverytimeWorse than gibs voting for gibs, it&#039;s likely we will see more ideological extremism and curtailing of liberties. Many modern Western terrorists are born in the country they attack. There&#039;s a reason these kids of immigrants who live a more comfortable life than their parents turn to extreme violence. Consumerism is not a self-sufficient story.
&gt;&gt;2245129Nigger, only slaves see others as &#039;managers&#039;. You&#039;re either shilling for the jews, or you&#039;ve got diabetes from kool-aid and there&#039;s no escape from paying the pharmaceutical/insurance industry for insulin to barely stay alive.Kill yourself.
&gt;&gt;2245158&gt;the face when I&#039;ve already relocated to soft, cushy Washington state. The taxes are fucked, but the weed is the best you&#039;ll ever eat/drink/vape/smoke/inject/rub_on_skin. Welcome to your new life, anon.
Listen, wagie. Can you stop making so much noise on your way to work? You sometimes wake me up, but even when if I&#039;m already awake it&#039;s still annoying to have to listen to you raging in the morning. I understand that you&#039;re angry at your situation, but please have some consideration. Thank you, wagie.
Wakie wakie ragie wagie. You better get up early so you can eat your breakfast and not starve half your workday, you have to stay healthy so you can help Mr Goldstein buy a new sailboat. Another day, another dollar.
&gt;&gt;2245158if you&#039;ve been pulling 162k a year for a few years you can now afford to chill for a long time assuming you have an intelligent and frugal lifestyle. what&#039;s wrong with that. i&#039;d be willing to become a drug-fueled wageslave for 162k
&gt;&gt;2245361same, but i&#039;m a bit older. looking back uni was the biggest waste of time and money of my life, and i&#039;d be waaay ahead if i had skipped it entirely. maybe something for you to consider. intelligent, driven, creative and tech-minded people can conquer the world from their moms basement in this day and age. fuck education on rails.
&gt;&gt;2245418let me tell you about the jews anon
I applaud those of u that have made it and didn&#039;t even have to work a 9-5 ever, good for you kiddos, good for you, you are part of the new wave of the future
&gt;&gt;2245421&gt; I think we will see a class of people living hand-to-mouth on whatever the government will give them, and they will always vote to get more.Really doesn&#039;t make sense when you think about it.&gt;More and more people do not put up with it. They often end up on disability, on drugs. I see it everyday working in a property management company. Probably 60-70% or more of our units are rented to people on some form of support (ODSP, Ontario Works, etc). Most of them smoke, drink, and do drugs excessively. It&#039;s very sad to see an under-class grow and grow within your own city.At the turn of the century, and until halfway about, the state paid for things called sanitariums which you could voluntarily be admitted to. They were largely self-contained. The hope was that people had an escape hatch they could go and somehow get well so they could rejoin society. Many did not of course, because psychological problems are real and prognoses are not really good for those kinds of problems.Physical problems counted as wellas old age. Really, any kind of infirmity.The Sanitariums had a small staff. Trusted residents fulfilled the different functions of the sanitarium. You could work as a janitor, a gardener, a handyman, a plumber, a cook, a launderer. Or, if you couldn&#039;t, you didn&#039;t have to.Society viewed these places as a welcome burden compared to the alternative- which is what you see today.Today, there is no where to go. So your &quot;under-class&quot; that &quot;grows&quot; in your city is really the flotsam which drifts from the periphery to the center. There is no social safety net now- and those earlier generations would be shocked to learn that we had become so callous- to treat people like they were disposable instead of treatable. They would be baffled- as to why we insisted they be forced to live in the streets and parks and underpasses and squats.They would no doubt condemn us for these things.
&gt;&gt;2245237&gt;Really ionizes my castor seedsEat them already.
&gt;&gt;2246518&gt;Really doesn&#039;t make sense when you think about it.How does it not make sense? I think its pretty obvious that people vote for their best interests. A population that subsists on government handouts will vote for whichever political party promises them more.&gt;There is no social safety net nowAsylums, and institutions have gone by the wayside, but they have been replaced by other means. There is a reason why many western nations are called &quot;Welfare states&quot; because they make people depend on the state for a greater and greater number of things from cradle to grave.
&gt;&gt;2245393&gt;tfw have been working at least 25 hours since i was 16 so i could eat
&gt;&gt;2246686&gt;How does it not make sense? I think its pretty obvious that people vote for their best interests.The people you talk about dont vote, and when they do, they haven&#039;t gotten more or better services. You think you know what you&#039;re talking about but I read way more that you do. The hacks on your radio shows are liars and your perception is totally ignorant of the history of this country.&gt;Asylums, and institutions have gone by the wayside, but they have been replaced by other means.Yeah, no. They&#039;ve been replaced with prisons. The civic services don&#039;t cover it. The charity services don&#039;t even come close. The functions have not been &quot;replaced&quot;.&gt;There is a reason why many western nations are called &quot;Welfare states&quot; because they make people depend on the state for a greater and greater number of things from cradle to grave.My whole point is that you talk about the existence of a welfare state- I&#039;m telling you- there is nothing but a mess of inefficient programs that cost us more than the old system it was supposed to replace.Seriously, everything you know is wrong. I&#039;d suggest reading up on the history. Plenty of material in the library. If you want to actually talk to some of these people (and be sure to ask who they voted for, ha-ha) go ahead and be on the streets downtown in the early morning as they will be as coherent as they&#039;ll get all day.
&gt;&gt;2246686&gt;I think its pretty obvious that people vote for their best interests.What a person believes and what they get are two different things. You haven&#039;t been around much, I can tell.If you think the vote comes down to &quot;what I want&quot; and &quot;what I don&#039;t want&quot; all I can say is, you&#039;ve never voted, or you have very simple mind that accepts whatever is placed in front of you is all there is.
&gt;&gt;2247064&gt;&gt;2247094Nothing you say has any merit, sorry but you&#039;re argument is literally &quot;listen kid I&#039;m smarter than you and I&#039;m right&quot;. Maybe you should read a book about how to form a proper argument?You&#039;re not convincing in the least and pretending to be an erudite grandpa just doesn&#039;t cut it
most people are dull conformists who easily accept authority&gt;talk to some normie about their job&gt;&#039;oh, my boss bla bla bla&#039;the words &#039;my boss&#039; are unacceptable for any non-cucked male to say. it&#039;s repulsive. you have a boss? fuck off, there are jobs and there are managers. you tolerate the managers, that&#039;s it. the point of saving money isn&#039;t to buy a lambo, it&#039;s to have a financial safety net so that at any point if the dumb cunt cuck manager at your job starts acting up you can tell them to get fucked. the savings allow you to live while you find a reasonable workplace with sane staff.management is a meme. managers are the true cucks. managers are conformists who stick around and take enough shit so that one day the owners give them a sliver of responsibility. they have the burden &amp; stress of steering the ship (in whatever limited capacity they&#039;ve been granted) but receive none of the rewards. workers get low stress, low reward. owners get high stress, high reward. managers get high stress, low reward.

Bottom left master race
It ducking sucks that I probably can&#039;t move out into the wilderness and homestead (not that I have the skills to do so) because someone is going to eventually come down, say I don&#039;t have the required permits, and shut me down.Then if have to move back to the city, where in order to survive I would need to rent a place and get a job which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place.
&gt;&gt;2245575Idk, man. I used to give out food at a gay park in the village during the winter and some of people lining up were missing limbs.
&gt;&gt;2246518We need an export coin, export these people to a third world country like... Belize.
automation on the waybuilding work ethic isn&#039;t that bad, experience is a great teacher
&gt;&gt;2245137&gt;Sure, you can break off and do your own thing like start a business or something but how many people are going to be successful doing so?This.Part of working for 40 hours a week for some boss is that there is security in doing so. You can&#039;t just be fired out of nowhere, if you are then you typically can collect unemployment insurance payouts for a bit.It&#039;s why many people don&#039;t like investing their own money into a business they want to do, instead they look for an investor. It feels safer having someone else risk their assets rather than you doing so yourself.It comes down to what money does a person have that allows them to safely attempt their own business or allow them to move onto another. Most people have almost no money to do that as studies keep on showing that most Americans couldn&#039;t even come up with $400 on the spot if required to.
&gt;&gt;2245106You must BECOME the faggot
&gt;&gt;2245158Is this a copypasta?
&gt;&gt;2245076Shitposting from a comfy teaching job, i&#039;m &quot;grading papers&quot; right now.
That&#039;s why I like working on a ship. Literally got half the year off with pay. Time and money I can use to start business
&gt;&gt;2245100This is a huge wisdom nugget in just a few words and I hope you faggots read it.Seriously, this is the key. If you have no kids and thus are responsible only for yourself, you CAN be free. You CAN survive without wage slavery. I know, because I am-- I don&#039;t pay rent, I live an adventurous (albeit marginal) lifestyle, and others envy me my freedom.The two things that will SHACKLE you to the furnaces of hell are1. Kids2. A mortgageavoid those and you can be free, if you have the guts.
&gt;&gt;2247167hell yeah must be nice living in high school/off your parents/other people&#039;s money/homeless/etc.
&gt;&gt;2249232tell us more
&gt;&gt;2245076https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KW8hfO6ysMBecause the educational system is designed to break their spirits.
&gt;&gt;2250090Well it all depends on what you want out of life. If you are willing to abandon the validation of the system that controls almost all aspects of daily life (call it capitalism, but it is more than just that), then you can be very free... but it is not all upside.You have to cultivate a powerful self-respect not to feel like a loser for lacking the bullshit trappings of middle-class &quot;success&quot; (mcmansion, babies, other garbage). If everyone around you and the people who you communicate with are all normies than you will just feel like a freak and a fuck-up.So, in my opinion to be happy with your freedom you should find places where others are also free and cultivate community there. Or build community online (although I think in person is better). If you are totally rootless and a drifter, loneliness will destroy you sooner or later; loneliness is one of the worst things in the world.The system is set up to isolate those who do not conform... and our fear of that isolation is powerful and controlling. So while it is crucial that you don&#039;t conform, it&#039;s as important that you don&#039;t let yourself be (or remain) isolated.Freedom is in my experience (using the 2 examples above, for instance) much more about what you DON&#039;T DO... Most freedom is gained through saying NO to things.
&gt;&gt;2247140I am an erudite person. I&#039;m not pretending to be. You came on here, I gave you the answers. You came with your beliefs and assumptions, and I refuted them. Now you don&#039;t like it, and call me names like &quot;grandpa&quot;. I&#039;ve had at least twice the life experience by my best guess. I guarantee I&#039;ve read far more books than you. Those books were prepared by experts in their fields, peer-reviewed. I&#039;ll bet you&#039;ve never completed a college degree. You don&#039;t respect knowledge- when was the last time you set foot in a library? Of the media you consume, what fraction are prepared by people with PhDs or experts in their fields? What makes you think an anonymous message board is an effective forum for ignorant people to gain wisdom about complex topics?Do your own homework- although you have a very low probability of doing anything but finding confirmation bias on the internet in between &quot;managing properties&quot; because you are intellectually lazy, incapable of logic, and too proud to admit you know nothing about anything.

&gt;&gt;2250717this is a nice postI often wondered why people around me won&#039;t buy crypto or even spend a few hours trying to understand it, and I realize you basically need to be a truly disagreeable autist with no regards for the opinions of others to actually risk money on this stuff and stand up all the criticisms
&gt;&gt;2251092RV living bro. Also good if you like a challenge for banging grills
&gt;&gt;2247152This sounds like someone who watched too much Office Space. Yeah, if you&#039;re the regional assistant manager of a company that makes crankshafts in a small town outside of Omaha, you&#039;re probably the kind of manager you&#039;re describing.But it&#039;s the &quot;workers&quot; who get consistently fucked in most organizations by never having any freedom or control than what is dictated to them. I currently make six figures working for a Fortune 500 where my career has gone astronomically up. I&#039;m 30 and I have unlimited paid vacation time. If I want to work from home, I&#039;ve shown I can do it, and I&#039;ve built a team that can handle some of the day-to-day so I&#039;m there at the end if someone needs me to dictate strategy.I&#039;m not saying there&#039;s not stress, but it&#039;s 11 AM on a Thursday and I&#039;m shitposting on 4chan drinking a beer while I wait for my dryer to get fixed, checking emails when they roll in.
RDD is up 29% since yesterday.You guys realize RDD is revving up for a huge pump over 100 sats, right? All the signs are there.
Bump
dump
&gt;&gt;2258905Still holding 400K from when it was 11 Sats.
Yeah. I bought in at 57 and it&#039;s struggling to wiggle. What&#039;s the time frame on these predictions? I&#039;m not in a hurry, but I&#039;ve seen the charts of pumps, they die in hours and I don&#039;t Wana miss at least an opportunity for some profit
&gt;&gt;2258905i kno. bide time and don&#039;t post on biz tho. these retards will fud it.
&gt;&gt;2259185This.
&gt;&gt;2258905i&#039;m hodling for now. curious to see where it goes. it held reasonably good volume without the whales and the floor was 45 sat which was unthinkable since about 2014
&gt;&gt;2259182holding 900k myself my man.LETS GET RICH!
Someone just literally added 30 btc sell wall to 59 sats. Then there is 51 btc at 60. This is about to crash I reckon, the manipulation is heavy here.
&gt;&gt;22591972.5 milWaiting for this to get to 5 cents to partially cash out.
&gt;&gt;2259226They&#039;ve been doing this for days now. It has remained very stable though.
&gt;&gt;2259251Ah I see, wasn&#039;t paying attention to it. Still the chart looks very unnatural I sold already might by back at inevitable dip.
&gt;&gt;2259270Yeah, it&#039;s always been like this.Going to wait til this thing hits 5 cents.
&gt;&gt;2259308I&#039;m going to wait probably until the end of the year minimum, maybe until 2018, or if this thing takes off, I&#039;ll just use them to tip pew die pie
&gt;&gt;2259358I&#039;m waiting until end of this year minimum too.
&gt;&gt;2258905What&#039;s the innovation here... Just a shit coin for Social media

Who here actually turned $1,000 into $1 million?Who here really mastered the blockchain?
Still no crash . . .
The new &quot;King&quot; of blockchain ha? kekhttps://medium.com/@yobanjo/how-etheroll-and-other-dapps-will-kill-ethereum-e973d8e1c465
where do you think ETH will go?i thought ETH would dip to 190-200. apparently we&#039;re not going below 210 now. i made profit from selling in the 220s...should i stop hoping it goes down and just buy at 215 or something? i have no doubt it will go up longterm but of course i don&#039;t want to sell high and buy...also high.
you did good selling, just wait for the dip now and don&#039;t be impatient.cheers
&gt;&gt;2260004The dip is neigh -- wait a week or two.
&gt;&gt;2260245&gt;&gt;2260108i bought back. :/ in two weeks there&#039;s news coming from eth and i think we&#039;ll be up by then.sigh, at least i have slightly more than before for the same initial investment.
Should I invest while its low or is it just a shitoken that will tank as soon as it hits bittrex
Name for people that don&#039;t spend all day looking at shitcoins?
It will tank as soon as it hits bittrex.Do your fucking research, all the &quot;people&quot; who bought at the ICO were investment companies working with BAT. There will be a massive dump when it hits bigger markets.BAT is garbage anyway. Use your head, do you think it&#039;s an idea that people will adopt?
BAT is a shitcoin held by a few whales. It&#039;s way overvalued and will crash once they start dumping.Reminder - investing in this means you&#039;re investing in the Brave browser. The brave browser will never come close to chrome in market share. Never bet against google
&gt;&gt;2259936&gt;&gt;2259968Both of you guys kinda confirmed what I found on my own research. I think I&#039;m going to dodge this shitoken.
&gt;&gt;2259968&gt;&gt;2260032Well, they will have a chrome extension... but are people really going to download it? Might as well put your money in an ask jeeves chrome extension
&gt;researcherswow we got so many talented &quot;researchers&quot;.I hope you people are simply trying to fool others and not fooling yourselves.
&gt;&gt;2260176Do you really think advertising, when supporting and peripheral industries are taken into account, will bow down to some retarded smart coin when they are a trillion dollar industry that controls the entire entertainment sector?&gt;muh brave browsernigger shut the fuck up. BAT would have to surpass google and a global advertising monstrosity to ever become viable. Not happening kid.
uhhhh, now is THE time to buy right?
already did you slow faggot
&gt;&gt;2258960I got in at 16. I imagine it&#039;s more or less going up all summer at least.
&gt;&gt;2258960&gt;bought a shitload of golem last week&gt;every coin seems to be mooning right now except golemits getting real hard to keep my hands iron right now. so tempted to sell and throw everything into strat or waves. should i stay patient?
&gt;&gt;2259449I have no comment on specific coins, but you&#039;re falling for the sunk cost fallacyIf it&#039;s worth it to pull your dick out of golem&#039;s asshole and shove it right into start or waves, do itThat being said, strat is shit. Idk about waves
&gt;&gt;2259449Sell some if you think you&#039;re missing out and your golem bags too heavy. I sold 700 two days ago to buy strat.
&gt;&gt;2258960No, 12k a few weeks ago was the time to buy. Now it is the second best time.
&gt;&gt;2258960If my moon when ever sell, I would buy the shit out of golem!
&gt;&gt;2259449And what are you going to buy, exactly? Every relevant coin is mooning, or mooned recently. Golem will too.
&gt;&gt;2258960Bought a few nights ago. I&#039;m ready for the moon lads.
&gt;&gt;2258960I&#039;m teetering on buying $100&#039;s worth more but I&#039;m not convinced yet.
This is a short-mid term coin for me, I don&#039;t see it doing the distance, hope im wrong.
How bigs your stack lads?&gt;11k
Are millenials the most fucked over generation since the ones which fought in WW1? Jobs require unrealistic amounts of experience, wages are shit, work hours are long etc.Also fuck this guyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXWNChoIluo&amp;list=LL4tNCo8qxkF0s0PUJiyPZJA&amp;index=58

&gt;&gt;2259747Why do so many startups fail then if that is true
Yeah, the world war spoils are long gone, there&#039;s nobody else to suck resources, welcome to real capitalism.
I&#039;m so fucking tired of you faggots shilling that Simon Sinek cuckshitthe dude knows jackshitand yea let&#039;s just casually bundle up an entire decade&#039;s worth of lives into a bunch of labels he chose arbitrarily, with roughly 0 actual statistics and researchdoes he mean millenials from the US?from europe?from western europe? or maybe eastern?does he mean 25+ chinese females?maybe those kids that made it alive over the age of 20 in Nigeria?oh right, HE&#039;S KNOWS JACK SHITaaa but wait, he has the perfect content for retarded questions like OP&#039;s, now I get it, ok
&gt;&gt;2259777&gt;world war spoils are long gonewhat did he mean by this
&gt;&gt;2259800You fucking idiot, I wasn&#039;t shilling him I literally wrote &quot;fuck this guy&quot;
&gt;&gt;2259824he&#039;s right though, &quot;generations&quot; are stupid
&gt;&gt;2259800are you upset friend
&gt;&gt;2259839Yes I agree with him that&#039;s the entire point, I posted the video to mock him, not to shill for him
&gt;&gt;2259699this jew writes books about how to become a better drone for the overlords to dominate. he&#039;s just shilling how lazy millenials are so he can make more shekels.
&gt;&gt;2259776Because they think everyone in the business needs a $3,000 Macbook for email and $8k iMacs for printing shipping labels and they treat Starbucks as a line item on their expense reports, and they spend a shit load of money on organic dog food for the office dog.
&gt;&gt;2259880do you think we&#039;ll ever need to wageslave again or will this coin bubble last forever, anon?
&gt;&gt;2259699They&#039;re the most deluded whinefags ever, thats for sure.
&gt;&gt;2259902Personally think it will really catch on globally by 2030
&gt;&gt;2259900Well I think its a bit simplistic saying startups are failing because people are stupid, ofcourse people are stupid, but people have always been stupid and it&#039;s not just a thing of this generation
&gt;&gt;2259814That the slaves nazi scientists who put humans on the moon are dead, the FED is out of gold and China is going to put the world back into 1800.

&gt;&gt;2260156it&#039;s ok bro, I feel you
After missing DGB u cannot miss huntercoin -srsly this is gonna moon
&gt;&gt;2260049
&gt;&gt;2260049where to buy?
Based off soley your post alone I would say that whatever profits you may make there will be short lived and nothing compared to DGB, buying in now. Please stop steering anons wrong.
&gt;&gt;2260049Seems good, tell us more about itI love gambling on shitcoins
just look at them numbers
&gt;&gt;2260049If you are going to shill at least post their specs. who is the dev, whats the mining rules, what is the supply distribution, when its the ico schedule.do it, but do it well. people here are sick of BAT tier alt coins. they have done so many that at least try to market it with actual back ground rather than a mentality challenged imbecile saying &quot;DUDEEE BUY ITS GOING TO MOON, FUK U CANT MISS THIS SHIPPP HEHEHE&quot;
Serious talk, is there going to be a dip soon? Got 2700 Euros on Coinbase wallet waiting to buy bit or ethShould i just buy now?
buy ETH. This is the perfect time to do so as it&#039;s in it&#039;s vertical phase before it moons again sometime this month.
500 billion market cap full steam ahead
&gt;&gt;2260011Shouldn&#039;t it dip anytime soon?Was gonna buy last week but shitbase didnt verify me yet
&gt;&gt;2260030if you try to time this stuff you&#039;re going to have a bad timeput your money in the coin or technology that you believe has the most merit and is currently undervaluedI could try to guess what eth and btc are going to do (and I have some ideas) but that would just invalidate my first point
dips usually happen during the weekend, I suggest you set up alarms and wait for the beep (good luck sleeping)
&gt;&gt;2260050On it.What would be a good realistic price?150 eth?
&gt;&gt;2260090150 is possible, but optimistic. At least set some small buy orders around the 170-180 range so you&#039;re not left missing out if it doesn&#039;t dip below that before recovering.
&gt;&gt;2260030it&#039;s in as much of a dip as you&#039;ll see
I was a nocoiner for my first six months of browsing this board, but after reading into the potential applications of Blockchain through Ethereum and the huge swings in Bitcoin, I&#039;m tired of sitting out the gains.Unfortunately, I&#039;m only a senior in high school. I&#039;ve been interested in finance since my freshman year and my parents give me significant independence in managing their investments. However, they refuse to let me make a position in crypto because they are suspicious of how to actually get them.I&#039;ve read about Coinbase and it seems like that may be my best option as a beginner crypto investor. Are there any other exchanges you would recommend as secure and user friendly? Additionally, I&#039;ve heard that it can often be hard to sell my crypto positions should I choose to take my money out. Is this true or is it just a lie told by the normies? Can I sell like I would a stock in most exchanges?
&gt;&gt;2259894There&#039;s a website that&#039;s good for helping new people with crypto. Here I&#039;ll post the link:www.google.comIf you can&#039;t figure out how to use it, try to find an adult you can.
Use coinbase, no, it&#039;s easy enough to buy and sell, sometimes transaction times are slow so be patient. Lurk more. Good luck.

When to buy btc?
buy high sell low
&gt;&gt;2259633Fuk off jew
10 years ago, if that isn&#039;t an option next time it dips over 20%
&gt;&gt;2259643&gt;normie memes
&gt;&gt;2259631anytime, it doesn&#039;t matter.btc is just your entry ticket to the coin market.you buy btc, spread it to various shitcoins, sell them @ pump &amp; dump, buy more shitcoins after the inevitable dip.rinse and repeat till lamboland.
&gt;&gt;2259750Buy btc for lower means a bigger bang for your buck.WHEN TO BUY
&gt;&gt;2259631&gt;&gt;2259952Easy peezy, just buy after the mod june crash
&gt;&gt;2259631Check out https://twitter.com/BTCPrice_Live
Is this the normal price now for Bitcoin?
&gt;&gt;2260203Yes.
&gt;&gt;2260203https://twitter.com/BTCPrice_Live
&gt; 2k&lt;fucking retarded way to type that, makes me angryI hate you op
&gt;&gt;2260226Shame upon me. Forgive me!
So is this where all the pump n dump happens? I wanna get in at the bottom. Which &lt;$1 shitcoins should I buy into and expect yuge gains on?
DGB, SC, XBY
Mooncoin is about to breakout and do 5000% gains. You heard it here first.
&gt;&gt;2258514That scam was two weeks ago. Don&#039;t rehash old shit.
Just buy DGB, GNT, and SCRDD too
&gt;&gt;2258519Dont listen to this nocoiner. He doesnt want you to make solid gains.
&gt;&gt;2258545Desperate bagholder detected.
&gt;&gt;2258561I only hold mETH shitbird, im not a poorfag like everyone in this board who need to pump shitcoins to get rich.
&gt;&gt;2258545Okay, mooncuck, tell me why should I have invested in Schmooncoin instead of DGB?
OP this is a once in a lifetime chance, listen to me, I am not fucking around. You need to take at least $300 and buy STRAT. I&#039;m being serious. Get some Bitcoin and buy Stratis. This thing is making money daily. If I wasn&#039;t a poor fag I&#039;d put 20% maybe even more into this crypto. But you need to get on this quick it is growing fast.
&gt;&gt;2258599&gt;tfw 1050 of the beauties
OP I&#039;m in a good mood today. I am loving humanity today. I am trying to help you become self sufficient and financially independent. STRAT, XRP, maybe ARK is what you want.Good luck!
&gt;&gt;2258505I&#039;ve made some dough on Gridcoin.
&gt;&gt;2258545Honestly the first time I read &quot;mooncoin&quot; I cringed. It&#039;s one of those coins people buy because they like the ticker. Next you&#039;ll shill KrazyGainzCoin
I&#039;m still learning this. Got 10k DGB. Should I sell part of it to diversify my portfolio?
&gt;&gt;2258632I almost feel bad that some people who come to this board for the first time fall for the shills and end up putting 1000s into absolute shit like RDD or POSW or Mooncoinah well cryptos a steep learning curve i guess just lucky when i came they were shilling ETH at $10
&gt;&gt;2258619lmao stay away from ripple, fully centralized pump and dump scam coin
&gt;&gt;2258682No. HODL that shit. I had 500k I bought before liftoff and daytraded 400k of those for shits and giggles. My last trade was selling at 650 waiting for another dip at 700 and it just kept going up to where it is now. Now my 100k coins will have to carry me to lambos still.Captcha: Rosens School

WAVES
&gt;&gt;2260059Just got Blockfolio today. Which exchange should I look at for Strat/BTC?
&gt;&gt;2260059the ATH is being broken every single day. Think of the future.&gt;&gt;2260183I know Bittrex and Polo host STRAT
&gt;&gt;2260205&gt;I know Bittrex and Polo host STRATIs there one you prefer? The three exchanges it shows are Bittrex, Cryptopia, and Poloniex
&gt;&gt;2258505basically said, buy some bitcoins and hodl till monday.normie scum is pumping in money on weekend, so wales sell and the shitcoins dip.on monday you buy the dip.thank me later.
And then leave it there for a year, would be a millionaire and poorer than sin itself?
&gt;$100about $110 :)
&gt;&gt;2258920Fuck yeah!I would be set for lunch at McDiddy&#039;s, or maybe fuel for a week.Getting straight into this coin business right now.
&gt;&gt;2258811invest 100 in xrp today, come out with 250 next week
Take rdd, xvg and dgb off that list
&gt;&gt;2258811Its good you want to start small. Just remember to trade like you would do with a big amount of money. 100 usd in xvg is ok if you have more. Going all in with 10000 usd is retarded. Guess Golem and Litecoin are a good start. You cant earn a lot this way but its impossible to loose everything with them. Start investing more if you got the hang of it.
&gt;&gt;2258811you can expect to be late to the party
People at wall st are going crazy over moon coin and it&#039;s now in over 17 magazines sold in 42 cities nation wide!

UP TOO THE TOP OF THE MOON
&gt;&gt;2259792I approve of this thread, made me laugh.
&gt;&gt;2259792thanks for the air i blew out of my nose. i hate these discord scumbags.
&gt;&gt;2259792my moon is itching to go to 3 sat
Listen goys.What are the stages of alt-coins?1. Dev Project - Characteristics and early specs.2. ICO3. Third party miners.4. Satochi-tier exchanges (directly to BTC &amp; ETH)5. Main exchanges (directly +100 ranked ones)6. Fiat exchanges (directly to USD)This is my proposal. We all are benefiting from the alt-coins. We are the real investors that look them before they go mainstream.We should intervene in all this stages as a anonymous group we are.Like a /biz/ APPROVED stage 1,2,3,4,5,6.For more than I earn buying ETH we know the consequences of their program language in the blockchain or its supply rules or its main holders capable of whaling. Their success is that JPMorgan shilled it and backed it, and took care of not over killing it.Why do we leave this variables as gambling? Look at the BAT ICO. People getting rip off. Just like specialized people rank stocks +AAA or -CCC, we as a board can price it and be early than normies.&gt;Look at this project, devs are sane and /biz/ score it and talks about it positive&gt;Look at this ICO, its unfair according to /biz/ people are pointing out the lack of fair distribution or professional instutions backing it.&gt;Look at the main exchanges accepting it, /biz/ had change its rating due all commercial partners and good marketing campaign&gt;This project has an score of BBB, not an original concept, newbie dev teamThis way we reduce the risk of gambling at random projects from India and Chinese devs, the whales cycles, the amount of alt-coins that can go to the moon and so on.
&gt;&gt;2259186Also with an anonymous group ranking it on every stage, we can let companies to specialize in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 stages of the coin. way faster.Ultimate creating an a /biz/ community capable of DEMANDING what can be minted next. To experiment with promising concepts and innovative specs, that way the dilemma of hard fork or soft fork won&#039;t destroy an on going coin, but minted in a new one due all the possible benefits and letting the market take it to the moon or buried it soon.
&gt;&gt;2259186i&#039;ll design the flag
&gt;&gt;2259294what do you think about it? like a open iso9001 but made by 4chan lurkers.in the long run we can bring prices down of certain alt-coin till they complain with certain specs.
hello darkness my old friend, come one /biz/ at least give a feedback.
&gt;&gt;2260128it won&#039;t work, even if it does work it won&#039;t add any value to the market.how will you reach consensus on here? take the average of everyone&#039;s vote? it will still be weighed by fud or fomo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvlMpoNKlPEFarmer Joe is live.
&gt;That&#039;ll be 2 moons ma&#039;am&gt;What? You only have...buttcoin? Sorry I don&#039;t understand what you are saying ma&#039;am. Unfortunately we only accept Mooncoins since president Trump declared it as the official currency of the United States.
&gt;&gt;2260127Im surprised you can even count you smelly ass coon, let me talk to your manager
&gt;&gt;2260150&gt;Ryan can you handle this? Theres some lunatic ranting about scamcoins and buttcoins on cashier number 4.
Well, both BTC and ETH have been shuffling along horizontally these last few days, I thought there would be more action. Volume tapers towards the end of the week, is it a good time to get out for the sell-off?Anyone got creative predictions for these two for the near 2-3 days.
&gt;&gt;2259149People are waiting for bank transfers, wires, and whatever else to go through. You will start seeing a lot of movement within 3 days.someone /thread me

Hello, i have basicly 800 $ made with ETH first transaction / deali&#039;m not to bad with math and pretty good in economie in general, but to be honest im a little bit confused about how to flip on cryptoiv made an account with bittrex and i can put some btc on it,so my question isWhat the best way to day trade / flip ? i dont want to make million like making 20-30$ a day would be enought for meI want a way to be able to trade multiple time a day, would i pay feed for each transaction ?ise btc to alt coin a good daily trade ?basicly what your advice for doing multiple day trade
&gt;&gt;2259875bump
&gt;&gt;2259875&gt;I want a way to be able to trade multiple time a day, would i pay fees for each transaction ?Yes, for Bittrex it&#039;s 0.25% in both directions
&gt;&gt;2259966any other platform ? or any BTC to X or X to btc 0.25 % fees and fuck me ?is that the norm

This just under 2 cents.Its about to goto 10This weekend its rumoured that static nodes go live and when that happens bittrex goes live. When that happens it will moon to a dollar in the blinknof an eye
&gt;&gt;2247555Go away smelly Indian. Wash the feces from your hands!
&gt;&gt;2247555See kek wills it.Buy it now before its added to bittrex you fools.Thisnis your one warning.Whales are ready to pump this shit to its value of 20 cents
&gt;&gt;2247568Dont say i didnt warn you&gt;buy today if you want triple by Saturday

XBY bois.At the top of the hour, you will see it. And if you are smart you will make some money.
You were warned. Screen shot this
&gt;&gt;2259550You think its gonna moon further?
&gt;&gt;2259561there will be blood in the streets
&gt;&gt;2259515Hmm on one hand these threads are dumb, on the other it would take verrrry little to make it go up further. I&#039;m in already regardless
&gt;&gt;2259603up is a direction. down is another...
&gt;&gt;2259597Or this guy could be dumping, which would be very dumb due to positive upcoming events for xby
You don&#039;t need to shill this coin, if you&#039;re on slack you can see it&#039;s at the early stages but a lot of people are working on it. It will go much higher naturally gradually.
&gt;&gt;2259626what if I told you that we got to a guaranteed 1500 for a reason
&gt;&gt;2259667last warning. first shot fired
&gt;&gt;2259704why don&#039;t you fuck off, you vague idiot.

&gt;&gt;2259716He&#039;s dumping on yobit ATM. We&#039;ll see what sort of impact he can create.
Not even phased. bring it OP
&gt;&gt;2259746you can hodl through. I prefer to make money from shaky hands at the same time.
&gt;&gt;2259758I don&#039;t blame you for trying things like this in general, but my guess is that there is enough demand for sub 1400 coins that you won&#039;t be able to make too much. I welcome being proven wrong, though.
&gt;&gt;2259778Hahaha op youre ducked this coin is goin to 10 cents this weekend
&gt;&gt;2259618Well I can garantee it will go 400% next week, downhill or uphill
&gt;&gt;2259915&gt;All I know for sure is that it will go up OR down drastically next week.Ty senpai very insightful
&gt;&gt;2259935Of dubs hen it will go up to 20 cents this weekend and i will get to suck a fat cock while my gf rides my cock
&gt;&gt;2259953Ok fine same thing with no penis

I got my first credit card like 5 months ago and I&#039;ve built my credit up to 720. I only had a $500 limit though and I want something closer to $1250. My first card was a discover it. What&#039;s a good second card that isn&#039;t discover and is something that I can buy BTC with?
&gt;&gt;2259844Hey, what do you think about using ONLY the money you actually have? That sounds like a great idea, don&#039;t you think?
&gt;&gt;2259844are u retarded?u invest credit money in a field u know shit about?also dont forget to buy high and sell low.i need more shekels.
Build your base with no fee credit cards. That way you don&#039;t need to worry about downgrading them or closing them. Closing a card hurts your credit because it can lower your average age of credit and it increases your credit utilization.As far as no fee cards I can recommend the chase freedom unlimited. You&#039;ll get 1.5% points on all purchases. Save them. Once you build more credit you can open the chase sapphire reserve ($450/year) but it will give you better options for redeeming the points you&#039;ve collected on the freedom unlimited card like 1.5x points value for travel etc.
&gt;&gt;2259857Yeah excellent point. OP if you&#039;re trying to use this to buy crypto then just put your phone down and walk away from the computer. Awful idea. If you want to just build credit because that&#039;s what adults do then that&#039;s fine.
&gt;&gt;2259857&gt;&gt;2259866&gt;&gt;2259884I use a local bank and I have no way to instant buy. They don&#039;t allow it through debit. I have a ton of money and I don&#039;t go over credit.
&gt;&gt;2259844amex blue cash is good if you buy a lot of groceriesIf you spend &gt;$6k on groceries a year get the blue cash preferred
30 BTC SELL WALL LADSIT&#039;S DUE FOR A CORRECTION
&gt;&gt;225986530BTC Buy wall aswell, what&#039;s your point?
I sold what was in my exchange and holding 50k in my wallet.

BLOCKFOLIO THREAD
&gt;&gt;2258884Where can I buy espers?
Total reflects my profit. I have my initial stake listed as a negative USD value in my portfolio.
&gt;&gt;2258902Man, xem seems so interesting, why is nobody really talking about it? Is there something I&#039;m missing?
We bull market now
I&#039;m holding in 16 coinsDid I spread myself to thin? Am I like Bilbo bagholdins
Not my full portfolio but these are the only ones I care about right now
&gt;/biz/ in 2 days
&gt;nocoiners every day
&gt;implying I didn&#039;t sell some BTC at the peak expecting a correction
&gt;&gt;2259780please, i&#039;m waiting for a huge crash so i can dump another $10k into bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2259780I&#039;ve only been really following this shit for about 3 weeks. But it seems that everything takes a giant shit on the weekend and then recovers/hits new ATH&#039;s for the rest of the week.You really want some spare cash lying around for when shit goes down because it&#039;ll be back in less than a week.
&gt;&gt;2259780C O P EOPE
&gt;&gt;2259821I use to think it crashed on weekends until I noticed it&#039;s just when the pumps and dumps happen. More casual traders that do dumb shit so it&#039;s the most profitable time to push the price either way.
&gt;&gt;2259820This.
Me shorting ETH/BTC in 2 days
&gt;&gt;2259854Better start nowWhales are viciousWhen your average 4chan shitposter believes he can become a millionnaire, that&#039;s when the dump begins
Mooncoin got new devs, new exchange, increasing volumeWhy haven&#039;t you bought your ticket to the MOON yet anon?
&gt;&gt;2259994The more fucking time I spend here the more believable this picture becomes
&gt;&gt;2260001So why havent you bought MOON if you do believe in meme magic
Hey /biz/,I&#039;m looking for a manufacturer that can create things similar to products from Intex recreational (air mattress people). Any suggestions?
Virtacoin will become the new XBYIt&#039;s on C-CEX and novaexchangeGET IT NOW WHILE ITS CHEAP ITS ONLY 1 SAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It&#039;s 100% going to 10 sats soon!
&gt;&gt;2259600Maybe more of a powerful mooncoinLook at that carnage at september
&gt;&gt;2259629I think it could but it just needs to get a lilte more popular for the pump because it has practically 0 volume ($80)
this is bad info, it&#039;s xvp now
&gt;&gt;2259600Good fucking kek op
Moon gonna moon to moon any second now
50sat by next week. This is the next moneymaker
Is there anything more sadder than a bagholder of a shitcoin?
Give me the basic /gestalt/ on the history of this stock
first very low, now little higher, may grow or shrink in future
&gt;&gt;2257974Overshilled by biz. Actually has nice tech and is superior to BTC for transactions imo, but the market seems very small.
&gt;&gt;2258118And you believe that the market is too small at this crucial time for its limited superiority to bitcoin to ever overtake it?
&gt;&gt;2258118What stocks should I be looking at now?I just got into cryptos.I&#039;d rather be before the rocket goes off, but seeing the most talked about stocks, they look like they are the ones to already have succeeded
&gt;&gt;2258177For stocks I&#039;d be looking at AMBA, RDS.B, F, AAPL, JBL, BAC
&gt;&gt;2258201Thanks. You have any advice for a new fish?
&gt;&gt;2257974Litecoin is a good store of money... I doubt it will tank below 20 at this point. Nearly hit 40 two weeks ago.Solid coin, but you cant make much money off it
&gt;&gt;2258239If you have a significant amount of money (50k+), your #1 priority is protecting your principal, in other words, don&#039;t make risky bets that can lose everything. Don&#039;t put all of your eggs into one stock. You will make a shitton of bad decisions at first. Don&#039;t make emotional decisions. If you have trouble sleeping, you&#039;ve put in too much money. Don&#039;t trade penny stocks at first. Read.
&gt;&gt;2258304I really appreciate the advice, I do.
Is Litecoin the whore of altcoins?
&gt;&gt;22584044shoI forgot one last one: Don&#039;t take tips.When you take other people&#039;s advice, you blame them for losing money, not yourself. You have to learn to make your own mistakes so that you can learn. In other words, take every stock suggestion I gave you above as a starting point, but assume I lied to you so that I can kek at your lost money.Also fuck financial advisors.
&gt;&gt;2258299The best strategy is to let it go near 20, then you buy. It usually reaches at least 25 so you can at least get 20% out of it
Its so cheap moving it aboutI just tried moving a small bit of BTC and LTC and LTC is cheaper by about $2 wtf
&gt;&gt;2258299Why does it not rise more?
LTC is best for daily transactions and being a digital currency to pay for things online.BTC is best for long-term gainsETH isn&#039;t meant to be used like a currency and the cost of gas is ridiculous.
&gt;&gt;2259885its due to all the other ICOS and other coins taking off right nowwhich causes older coins to lose volume and people are more interested in making quick gains with these new coins than to hold in LTC
STRATIS WON&#039;T STOP UNTIL $10 PER COIN, $10 BILLION MARKET CAP
&gt;&gt;2258451&gt;stratis at 100k&gt;that&#039;s way too high, correction is coming and I will just buy the dip&gt;next day stratis at 150k&gt;Welp. I was wrong it won&#039;t rise too much from here though...&gt;another day stratis at 200k&gt;holy shit I should&#039;ve bought it.... it&#039;s too late now&gt;wake up today&gt;check blockfolio&gt;stratis at 300k+FML
&gt;&gt;2258451TELL ME ABOUT I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT
I think you mean $100/coin. Its already $8.50.
&gt;tfw could only buy 100 stratis when it was 2.50It sucks to be poor, wish I had money to buy more.
bought at 20k, sold at 30k, got back in at 70k, sold at 90k, now i&#039;m back in at 138k AND IM FUCKING HOLDINGLesson learned
Long term prospects of this one ?
this is fucking bullshit I was going to buy stratis but I decided not to because the steps were too tedious
&gt;&gt;2259872Don&#039;t be a fucking idiot who buys in at ATH. There&#039;s your long term prospects.
&gt;&gt;2259910thats what i was thinking yesterday when it was at $6
&gt;holding a literal niggercoin
I&#039;ll keep this short and sweet before &quot;STOP MAKING THESE THREADS&quot; guy turns upthis is a new ETH token, a self mining smart contract that will have a token creation service, so you can create other tokens with this (and it destroys what you used to create the new token).it has a very low supply and &quot;mine&quot; rate, about 7700 coins per day constant, currently around $4.5 so the market cap is &lt;$2mmwith the low supply, this can hit $20-25 and still not break a $10mm market cap in the short term - you do the mathcurrently only exchange is livecoin, but dev said new exchange coming by the end of the week after testing is completedhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1867535.msg19296229#msg19296229some of you guys are cool, here&#039;s your chance to get in at the ground floor, the rest of you, fuck off
&gt;&gt;2251388I just randomly checked this today and glad it&#039;s up 100+% from last week. I feel really good about my investment
&gt;&gt;2251408I&#039;m currently $4k up senpai, my body is not even ready for this
&gt;&gt;2251388&gt;livecoinfound this on my own the day i discovered the crypto world beyond bitcoin...the next day, i woke up and it was $3 from cents the day beforehope i can get some before that new exchange is added. waiting on a paycheck.
I&#039;ve been holding a good amount of MNE since ~20 cents. Comparing this coin to literally any other coin with a similar market cap and coin supply spells it all out...this can hit $50, easy. My only concern is keeping my hands strong enough to not taking profit when it blows past 20 bucks.
&gt;&gt;2251388Dude wtf stop telling people before its on another exchange. Wtf is wrong with you snitching autists... These begging faggots don&#039;t deserve to get on this ship.
letss goooooooooo
&gt;&gt;2251483autists/neets won&#039;t buy it. they only buy coins that are a few hundred sats or less, this is too rich for them. biz always complains the miss the train, so here&#039;s their shot. all the moonfags will just glance over this thread like they always do.
We&#039;re going up, boys
&gt;&gt;2251506Well these threads are making it moon and that brings too much attention.
I literally just spiked the price from 23 to 25kjust tricking the buy bots with orders and selling highPOS coin but i got 1200 still so w/e
&gt;&gt;2251519This. Everybody shut the fuck up if you care about this coin.If you guys end up making this moon, it&#039;s going to get dumped inevitably and that will ruin it for future investors and stunt its growth. You have to just leave it the fuck alone for a few years. No more touching it.
There&#039;s a p massive sell wall right now. it probably won&#039;t break .0025 for another week or so. Or at least until it&#039;s on another exchange.
I believed this coin was a shillcoin for a long time. The website is still a little difficult to comprehend (i am a fucking moron, but a read through several times before understanding)essentially this would allow normies to make their own coins. It is a bit of a holy grail coin.I know I have wanted to utililize blockchain technology to implement into research programs at my University, but do not have the software skills to do so.Long story short, once i get a grip on how crypto/blockchain works a bit better I think I will use MNE platform to create a coin/blockchain for research papers published within or written at my university.I am writing this not to shill, just to give a real life use for a coin. This coin, like many, has huge value if used. HOwever, what sets it apart i think is that the demand for use will be much higher in the near future.
Hope it&#039;s gonna be on Blockfolio soon
i fucking love moneyhodling this until token service release
&gt;&gt;2251388Anyone have a referral code for livecoin?
&gt;&gt;2251636Livecoin-q4c83kbd
&gt;&gt;2251636https://livecoin.net/?from=Livecoin-N2De64DXfamilio
&gt;&gt;2251641It wont work says its invalid
&gt;&gt;2251388The fact that this coin isnt at a minimum of $10m mc blows my mind, undervalued
fuck you guys im throwing 2 of my 5 eth in. go big or go home mfer&#039;s
&gt;&gt;2251555Blockfolio will add Livecoin soon, maybe someone has the screenscap.
&gt;mfw spend 3 BTC on MNE when it&#039;s $4&gt;goes up to 9&gt;elated&gt;crashes to $1 and stays there for weeks&gt;mfw kms
&gt;700% inflation&gt;lowfuck off pajeet
&gt;&gt;2251850Every thread. Every single thread, this guy comes in and posts this same GIF. hahahahahahah....what do you want from us, dude? Do you want our pity? Or are you a masochist that loves abuse? Because I&#039;ve seen you get a lot of the latter, yet, here you are, complaining about your terrible trade and low IQ
&gt;&gt;2251850What fucking chart do you even use? It never went up to 9, it went up to 7.8 or something, and it crashed to 3You must have bought the wrong coin
Can anyone help me out? I just bought 70 MNE on livecoin. To withdraw, do i just send it to my ether wallet address? I&#039;ve never bought an ether token before, not sure if i&#039;m missing something and don&#039;t want to lose the coins

&gt;&gt;2252134yes, the wallet needs to either support MNE, or you&#039;ll need to add the contract address in MIST:0x1a95b271b0535d15fa49932daba31ba612b52946the coins will go to any eth address, but you can&#039;t move them until you watch the token contract address or your wallet provider supports it (so don&#039;t send them to coinbase or something)
&gt;&gt;2252036It hit 9 you fucking retard, buy some glasses.
&gt;&gt;2251553&gt;I have wanted to utilize blockchain technology to implement into research programs at my university, but do not have the software skills to do so.It&#039;s not that difficult, the coding for ERC20 tokens is based off of existing languages. They have tutorials for it, and you can go to stack overflow if you need help.The only reason why this coin is valuable, is because lazy normies such as yourself that &quot;have the idea but can&#039;t code it&quot; won&#039;t actually look up chrome extensions that are free and already make an ERC20 token for you
&gt;&gt;2251388&gt;before &quot;STOP MAKING THESE THREADS&quot; guy turns upIM HERE BITCHYOU FUCKING DID IT AGAIN - YOU COULDNT HELP YOURSELFTHISCOINDOESNTNEED SHILLED---ALL THIS THREAD WILL ACCOMPLISH IS TO DRIVE UP THE PRICE FOR SMART PEOPLE WHO WILL ACTUALLY BUY IT, AND INVITE DUMB DUMBS TO COME FUD IT WITHOUT KNOWING THE BASICS OF ECONOMICS/CRYPTO. IT WILL ALSO MAKE IT A BIZ MEMEDELETE THISYOU FUCK
&gt;&gt;2252521nope
&gt;&gt;2252669look on livecoin faggot
&gt;&gt;2252594Top Kek
&gt;&gt;2251850LOOOOOOOL the same fucking guy EVERY thread
&gt;&gt;2253187STOP THE SHILLINGTHIS IS NOT A PnDSCUM
&gt;&gt;2251418Dude how did you found this gem ?Teach me
&gt;&gt;2253251i&#039;ve sent some eth from gdax to livecoin and it&#039;s not in my wallet; it&#039;s been an hour since i sent it. is this why livecoin has a poor reputation? i don&#039;t know what&#039;s happened to my eth. help? i need help.
&gt;&gt;2253334sweet baby jesus it&#039;s pending now. is the ether network slow today or is livecoin just dog shit? bittrex is far superior to this trash site. i&#039;m on the fence as to whether this is a sign not to buy mne.
&gt;&gt;2253334hover over the wallet status green checkmark on the balance screen and it&#039;ll tell you the block height of their walletcompare that to the block number your transaction is in, and double check you sent it to the right addressif the wallet is well past your block, either gdax didn&#039;t release the transaction yet (sometimes they do it in batches) or the livecoin wallet hasn&#039;t credit it yet (which can happen in batches too)
&gt;&gt;2253366could be slow network, could be gdax posting it late or using cheap gas, could be them with a slow wallet/credit process, I&#039;ve never had any trouble with ETH deposits with them
&gt;&gt;2253334I just sent btc without issue. Got 20 of this bad boys. 0.024 price.I expect at least 100% profit. Price is high. But potential is moon.So far i did not lose on my coins. Let see will i keep my streak.
&gt;&gt;2253371&gt;&gt;2253392thanks for the explanations.&gt;&gt;2253393it&#039;s gone up almost a dollar since i&#039;ve been waiting to buy.
&gt;&gt;2253462&gt;it&#039;s gone up almost a dollar since i&#039;ve been waiting to buy.sameI think im addicted
When is the game going to be revealed?
&gt;&gt;2259571Elaborate, dafuck
&gt;&gt;2259674I have 35+ potential business ideas that I will be sharing on ideas500k.com. I am sure some of the ideas are quick half a million dollars ideas.
&gt;&gt;2259571as soon as pajeet learns1. to use the loo2. there is no effective free marketing, especially on a NEET containment board
&gt;&gt;2259686What makes you think they are any good?
&gt;&gt;2259705One of my recent ideas has turned into a company that employs 9 people. We are entering a big market.
&gt;&gt;2259736link to company
&gt;&gt;2259736&gt;&gt;2259736Cool. I also have a couple of potential biz ideas, but I haven&#039;t taken any action yet. When are you sharing your ideas?
&gt;&gt;2259754Are you an investor? I would like to remain anonymous. I am certain you will use the product of my company, and when you get that hunch (is this is?) it probably is it. If you would like to read about my other potential business ideas, check out ideas500k.com occasionally. Cheers!
&gt;&gt;2259832I&#039;m not talking about what you&#039;re shilling here but your supposed success story; those are the only ones I care for
&gt;&gt;2259789I did not take any action either, I was hoarding one idea after another, one after another, until I opened up to a good friend of mine who is a business man. I told him only 1 of my recent ideas and it grew into a company. I will share them on ideas500k.com. At the moment I am waiting for someone to (kick start) the project with 10$ worth of Bitcoin. If you are also an idea man, I can tell you that my ideas range from offline to online markets, some ideas can be executed by a single person, some require heavy investments. They are all innovative, fun and most of them - useful. I will let them out for business man to read about, as I am getting more and more busy with the successful business I am taking part of now. I love ideaing.
&gt;&gt;2259840Where are you from? What is your current occupation? What are your interests? We are branching out to neighboring countries and we are looking for native people who would like to become partners.
&gt;&gt;2259571fuck off you unimaginative third world turd
&gt;&gt;2259855Thnx. Unfortunately I dont have any bitcoin, good luck thou. Bookmarked ur page.
Bitbean is Not a meme.
I live in Europe and I want to buy bitcoins, I was thinking about buying from Kraken after reading around a bit. But it doesn&#039;t really matter where I buy from, right?
Europeans can buy from coinbase too
&gt;&gt;2256861Doesn&#039;t matter, use anycoindirect.eu if you want them fast. Kraken has long verification proces now due to influx of new users
&gt;&gt;2256887German people can&#039;t buy bitcoins from coinbase.
&gt;&gt;2256861Where in Europe?
&gt;&gt;2257005I correct myself, I don&#039;t think Europeans can use coinbaseIt says they have a debit card option, but apparently only American debit card, ofcourse nobody in this market is capable of being clear on payment options
Step up the crypto trading game, add me on Skype: CryptoAnna
&gt;&gt;2256861bitcoin.de with express-buying
&gt;&gt;2257036france
&gt;&gt;2256861Kraken only. Coinbase is jewish as fuck and has shit limits.
&gt;&gt;2257047Im eu, i can
If I buy bitcoin at a certain price, but the website takes a long time to process it, will I be getting the bitcoins at the value when I bought them, or when they get processed by the people I buy it from?Or might this vary?
bittstoreuk@protonmail.comI can sell you up to 5 BTC directly, depending on what verification and payment method you are wanting to useI&#039;m a verified trader on LBC with 100% pos feedback and can verify. If the exchanges are messing you around hit me up
&gt;&gt;2259579You should be paying whatever price was agreed once the trade was initiated and your payment has processed
&gt;&gt;2259636I see. Thanks for the info
&gt;&gt;2257005absolutely wrong
&gt;&gt;2259715Wrong
Don&#039;t use Cuckbase. Use Bitstamp. First European Fully Licensed exchange, been with them for years. Great bunch.
Literally the first 30 threads on this board are about coins. Where are all my stock bros at?Currently heavily into low budget european airlines as well as having gone long on some banks after brexit, portfolio is up 19% in a year.What&#039;s your portfolio like?
&gt;&gt;2258064&gt;portfolio is up 19% in a year.
&gt;&gt;2258064down 10%, put a load into CARA and AMD, then both crashednow I focus on crypto
buy moon coin.
&gt;trading (((stocks)))Go back to bed grandpa
&gt;&gt;2258077
NVDAFSLR
&gt;&gt;2258064MOON!!!But srsly. I&#039;m heavy into tech, banks, and REITS with those 3 making up around 60% of portfolio. Not sure exact number but probably up around 25% for the year. That said, I&#039;m starting to get freaked out by the valuations so I&#039;m slowly paring down out of tech. I&#039;d like to back out of the REITs too since rising interest rates will fuck with them, but those 10% dividends...Not sure what to go into with the cash I&#039;m sitting on. I like tobacco since they always seem like steady gainers with good divs - ditto insurance companies. Thinking on a macro scale, the whole ETF/Index trend has pumped money into &#039;safe&#039; investments so there&#039;s a lot of talk that low volatility equities are overvalued - I agree, but again, not sure where exactly to escape to.On a purely speculative side, I have some auto (F,GM) since they&#039;ve been beaten down and are starting to seriously invest in electric/self driving (like they should have been doing yrs ago). Ford even has some ride sharing thing. I think in the next 10 yrs, they&#039;ll do well.
&gt;&gt;2258064&gt;used to invest in stocks&gt;make an average of 10-15% max per year because taxes and high fees cucked me&gt;decided to try crypto&gt;make 20% per monthYou should cash out and invest everything into BTC, even if you just put it to loan on something like poloniex you&#039;ll get like 50% a year
&gt;&gt;2258077&gt;&gt;2258091&gt;&gt;2258097&gt;&gt;2258098&gt;&gt;2258192Please leave, this is about stocks. Memecoins already occupy 99% of this board.&gt;&gt;2258130I&#039;d agree that some tech companies are out of touch with reality like netflix with a P/E of over 200, and all these new highs for amazon and apple feel a bit bubbly though they have solid cash reserves and are still growing reasonably.Thinking of selling out of banks and going for green technologies, though still haven&#039;t found which companies look the most attractive.
&gt;&gt;2258537&gt;I hate money, fuck off
everything is too expensive. can we just have a massive stock market crash plz?
&gt;&gt;2258064i hate nocoiners
&gt;&gt;2258064One hundred percent small cap biotech. Just sold off my industrials (previously ~20%) to have a stab at crypto. Sold financials earlier this year.Taking a step back from U.S. equities - basically this&gt;&gt;2258558
&gt;&gt;2258550fucking memecoiners, why can&#039;t I be happy with excellent returns while taking a fifth of the risk.I might invest part of my funds in coins, I might not.
&gt;&gt;2258077&gt;&gt;2258064LUL 19% IN A YEAR LUL
&gt;&gt;2258563Just got 1% gains on the dow today crypto bitch suck it
how big are your portfolios in stocks fellow anons?just want to compare to the cryptofags because i think stocks are for big boys only
&gt;&gt;2258587Seriously. Anybody with 100% portfolio into memecoins and more than 30k is insane.&gt;&gt;2258537I&#039;m excited to see if the companies get a one time tax reprieve on overseas cash. Investment or special dividend would both be a boon. I&#039;ve looked at some greentech, but they seem like tech in that they&#039;re selling for way higher than I&#039;d like to pay. I guess oil seemed interesting just because the execs are finally realizing that oil won&#039;t be no1 for much longer and are making plans to pivot to new energy sources. That said, I looked at Shell&#039;s plan and they&#039;re only investing 1%/yr into alternative energy sources. I think that&#039;s a huge mistake.Post a new thread when you find something interesting and I&#039;ll do likewise. It&#039;s good to see something other than coinshilling here.&gt;&gt;2258563I gotz coinz bitch.
Wow these yearly gains are a bad DAY in crypyo. Thanks for the warning to never waste valuable time and opporitunity with stocks.
&gt;&gt;2258646Enjoy your &quot;bad day in crypto&quot; with your $400 wallet. Even if your shit doubles you can barely buy a video card or something.
&gt;&gt;2258064&gt;portfolio is up 19% in a year.Nice, will you use the gains to buy your wife&#039;s son some toys?
&gt;&gt;2258646gotta agree that stocks are boring unless you have serious moneys worth. but derivatives are not boring
&gt;&gt;2258689you have to be a wizard to trade derivatives profitably though
My portfolio is boring indexes at my 401kekRecently upped international stocks to 40% which I feel happy about. 14% bonds
&gt;&gt;2258064Lol stocks, look at this loser. Making 3% gains in a month.I bet he made 3k out of 300k in 2 months xD
&gt;&gt;2258734xD lol epic haha
&gt;&gt;2258605Portfolio is at $24K&gt;&gt;2258644Thinking of buying some apple for this exact reason, hoping to see a special one time diviend if there is tax reform. Still don&#039;t understand the american tax system that is literrally begging for companies not to return foreign profits to the country.&gt;&gt;2258685I&#039;m 21, I&#039;ve invested everything earned from summer jobs in addition to student loans that in my country you don&#039;t pay any interest on till you&#039;re finished college.
&gt;&gt;2258703you dont trade them, you wait for the next big crash then you buy and hodl sp500 futures
&gt;&gt;2258064&gt;portfolio is up 19% in a year.are u even trying?why aren&#039;t you on the crypto train yet?u could gain 19% in a day.
&gt;&gt;2258859&gt;u could gain 19% in a day.and lose 40% the next
Opened up my brokerage account 2 weeks ago. Predominantly trading options but will trade futures later and futures options when I&#039;ve learned more and I have more capital.Really enjoying it. A lot to learn and it&#039;s challenging.
&gt;&gt;2258675&gt;$400I&#039;ve got $32k in crypto and I know there&#039;s people on this board with well over $100k into it.
Been doing reckless option trading, I&#039;ve enjoyed it so far. That large spike and dip late march was a deposit and withdrawal.
&gt;&gt;2258909shit lol. nice gains in the end of may
&gt;&gt;2258872Then make 75% moar.
&gt;&gt;2258951I&#039;ll be honest, was getting a little worried.
All my degenerate gambler addict friends are rotating off of Altcoins and loading up on AMD stock as their next &quot;get rich quick&quot; scheme...This does not give me confidence in AMD at all...
&gt;&gt;2258970what options are you trading?
&gt;&gt;2258589LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL!i make and lose that in half a fuck dicks worth of time you fuck pussy stockers!
&gt;&gt;2258991Been doing AMZN, SPX, and various earnings here and there. The big jump towards the end of May was SPX and PANW. I&#039;m going to have to give up on SPX though, way too volatile for me.
&gt;&gt;2259007Ya but you make like 50 cents
&gt;&gt;2258064MZORNVIDIA#yolo
&gt;&gt;2259007That something you&#039;re proud of?
&gt;tfw bought chipotle on the e.coli dip&gt;still down a year and a half later
/rgt/ - robinhood general thread&gt;&gt;2258673it is basically stock trading general nowits up every day
I was in tesla and was up 70% in 6 months. Put all those profits in crypto and up 100% in a month. Still got $15k in tsla since its a long term hold.
why does /biz/ have such a hard-on for DGB?i thought it was a &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/ coin?
My dick is rock hard. Look at the real time buys.
&gt;&gt;2259806Do you even know what it&#039;s about newfag?
I NEED to get rich. I made a couple thousand of cryptos but I want MILLIONS. What do I do? Sell tshirts? Pretend to be a syrian refugee selling handmade bracelets on etsy that I got for 10 cents of alibaba?
&gt;&gt;2258612Reinvest your profits into more crypto famalam
&gt;&gt;2258612rob a bank
&gt;&gt;2259804&gt;tfw money tied in ETH, Ripple and Gnolem&gt;tfw getting slightly impatientI believe ETH can easily go to $400 in the next few months though, and Ripple is going to break its ATH. Golem will probably moon once Brass is released. Considering putting some of my ETH in coins such as ANT, Waves or Bancor though.
You did the right thing and listened this time without waking up too many whales. Maybe youre not all idiots (or at least one of you isnt). Well done.Maybe now you&#039;ll believe me when I say that this coin is a long way from done.
&gt;&gt;2259125shut up nigger dgb is dead
&gt;&gt;2259173this.seriously, stop shilling this trash.
thank you
&gt;ITT new investors don&#039;t know about the dump part yet
&gt;&gt;2259199you should ignore the part of your brain that is stopping you from jumping onto a sure winner out of pride or because &quot;it doesn&#039;t deserve it&quot;. DGB has undeniably tapped into something. the beast has awoken.
Anybody who thinks it will dump from here is wetalldid.Dumps happen from the top, they don&#039;t steadily decrease.Tons of buys and sells are happening within milliseconds of each other, that&#039;s called whales manipulating the price.DGB ain&#039;t over.
&gt;&gt;2259173&gt;&gt;2259199This is the worst attempt at Fud all week. So sad lol
&gt;&gt;2259173&gt;&gt;2259199when i show up again, the one&#039;s who paid attention will benefit (or they might see the behaviours themselves already). All you will get is laughed at more.
Australian based PnD. First pump set for tomorrow, thought I&#039;d let you guys know to say thanks for all the good tips in the past lol.https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJg4XJ8uVmGBkFFQg
I am an Australian who likes to make money off of Whales tell me more senpai.
&gt;&gt;2259021Some whale seems to have set up a telegram to boost his buying power by inviting other users to pump and dump low volume alts
&quot;We blacks are only obese because we can&#039;t afford better food?!?! It&#039;s all WHITE PEOPLES FAULT!!!&quot;&gt; In reality, Niggers actually get more obese as they make more income&quot;still white people&#039;s fault!&quot;
&gt;&gt;2259011Is this INFX?
&gt;&gt;2259126Every time he posts a coin the coin is already up 50%+ from him buying.Then when he posts it and it goes up he is the forst to dump. Watch the next coin he picks.
Nocoiners&gt;this is a slow day
&gt;&gt;2257743+1500$ :(
I would put a couple million in diversified investments (real estate, stocks, bonds) (30,60,20)I would keep a few hundred thousand in alt/bitcoinsI would buy house in pic relatedI would buy a nice Porsche and a nice daily driver (Lexus LS or Range Rover)Then I would hit the club and go on a 10 day coke and champagne bingeWWYD?????
&gt;&gt;2255161not spend money like a black person
&gt;&gt;2255161small house, some small property. serious mining rigs.invest the rest in businesses or crypto.
&gt;&gt;2255161*spits on the floor*Nigger.
&gt;30,60,20
&gt;&gt;2255161I&#039;d hodl until it crashed and overcorrected to below what I paid for it in the first place and then post a lot of posts with a lot of really angry frog pictures begging for advice on how to recuperate.

Buy a small house in my hometownBuy a small carBuy a Super NintendoHave some nice vacation with my loved onesInvest the rest
Keep 20% in crypto, take the rest out and diversify. Travel around he world (cheaply...I&#039;d backpack around and stay in hostel). Come back and buy a nice place in the city.Most of all, not let anyone know that I&#039;m rich.
&gt;&gt;2255161The dip.
&gt;&gt;2255161This sounds like something a sixteen year old would doLike what the fuck are you thinking man
Great thread.Stay invested, buy a giant commercial building. Compartamentalize the building into an auto shop, electronics shop, conputer shop, welding shop, wood shop, paint shop, ju jitsu/ boxing gym, fitness gym. I&#039;d spend my time building projects and training. Travel in between.
&gt;&gt;2255855Went backpacking for the first time last summer, it&#039;s so much better than staying in a fancy hotel
&gt;&gt;2255161I don&#039;t understand... How have you possibly bought something that hasn&#039;t mooned?Literally every coin I hold has at least doubled in value, some went up %65000.You can play darts with what coins to buy and come out rich.
&gt;&gt;2255161I would probably go into education after spending some time traveling the world and trying to find places that just need a lil $$$ to help lift the communities there. Before becoming a teacher/professor I would want to buy some land and build a sustainable community for people to come and study ecology/work trade/vacation. Never let anyone know how loaded I was, live like a bum for a few years trying to make every day a mission to make someone&#039;s life a little better.....Def buy some guns
&gt;&gt;2255161A penthouse and a nice car.
couple g&#039;s of some proper gear in one night and theres no way in hell a man whos amassed a fortune will be able to participate again the next evening. the body wont allow it
&gt;&gt;2255161Considering I&#039;m just a small-time coiner, I&#039;d probably be able to afford a 5 year old used 4 door.
&gt;&gt;2255161that house is so ugly!
&gt;&gt;2255161keep frugal, keep humble, and keep accumulating.there is so much more to come.
&gt;&gt;2255161Buy a small appartment building, buy a good PC, play videogames all day
Buy myself a cosy cabin in the midwest, enough guns to keep me entertained, internet, and live my life happily thereafter
&gt;&gt;2256976yeah you&#039;d rather live in a modern glass building #555223 on the 50th floor with a &quot;nice view of the city&quot; geting charged $500 a day, right?stupid niger
&gt;&gt;2255161found the nigger
reinvest and stack like a jew. Get cash, run after the stockmarket crash to the broker and invest in commodities and water.
I would buy some Colt.45, a bucket of KFC and snort crack off a crack whores cleavage.
&gt;&gt;2255903&gt;Stay invested,fine.&gt;buy a giant commercial building......Ok???&gt;Compartamentalize the building into an auto shop,Whoops you fucked up.&gt;electronics shop, conputer shop,You&#039;re up against Amazon and Best Buy.&gt;welding shop, wood shop, paint shop,What is Automation?&gt;ju jitsu/ boxing gym, fitness gym.Thats a saturated market and you&#039;ll just get cheap greasy swaggers sweating all over your machines.
&gt;&gt;2255161Just keep holding Monero until about 30% of my holdings is enough to build a successful LFTR nuclear company.First target is 7M and is when I&#039;ll relax my jew tendencies to more affluent normie ones. LFTR calculations start after that.&gt;&gt;2257155Lol
&gt;&gt;2257155who the fuck wants to do all that paperwork and shit. just figure out your new budget to retire on and go from there.

&gt;&gt;2255161Buy the used 1987 Nissan 300ZX I found for sale, go to America to do an all-American roadtrip with my buddies, buy out a small office space that&#039;ll be like a second home while others think I&#039;m working.Take 70% of what I have left to buy real estate, invest the rest in other shitcoins and become one with the whale.
&gt;&gt;2259581&gt;buy out a small office space that&#039;ll be like a second home while others think I&#039;m working.i&#039;ve always wanted to buy an office, build a hidden living space into it, then use it as a tax deductible business expense.
mostly i just care about not having to work again ever. but in excess of that, i&#039;d not buy a home but build a fucking bunker that looks like a house. no lambos or yatchs. i&#039;d probably still spend most of my time shitposting on here

Great week for altcoins, right guys?Guess what comes next when everybody will want to secure/cash those incredible gains...
BTC is being a cult for you retards, why not just make some cash? You look like you grew affection for a fucking currency.Of course it is going to go on for some time growing with the same pattern it always had, but do you really expect it to go on forever?
&gt;&gt;2259644It drives them nuts that &quot;shitcoins&quot; are experiencing the same growth explosion they got to enjoy with Bitcoin. Their precious, idealistic &quot;told-ya-so&quot; coin is getting competition, and the vast array of competing crypto suggests that maybe it isn&#039;t so special after all. It&#039;s purely emotion, and emotion is a real stupid thing to have in a game like this one.
&gt;&gt;2259644Yes, in 30-100 years anyone with 1 BTC will be quite wealthy I imagine
&gt;&gt;2259694theres no &quot;competition&quot;, its newbie &quot;traders&quot; flocking to lower unit priced coins trying to find the next big thing and in the process pumping the shit out of almost every alt on polo. its just another bubble that will pop harder than most due to the nature of the gamblers involved. this already played out almost exactly in 2013.
&gt;&gt;2259644What are you talking about?BTC is the sinews of war. This is how people secure and cash their gains.If you made 10k with DGB you convert to BTC to protect your money from pump.Have you even noticed exchange use it as the prefered unit?Fucking idiot.
&gt;&gt;2259733&gt;If you made 10k with DGB you convert to BTC to protect your money from pump.I meant dump
I just took out an $11k loan at 6.9% APR for the explicit purpose of buying ETH in the next few days once it clears my bank.Am I crazy? It&#039;s only 2 points higher than my mortgage and I have the reserve funds to cover the loan if need be.
&gt;&gt;2253304If youre not a degen and go all in and then put more money in it go for it
&gt;&gt;2253304eth is the strongest there is, but it&#039;s impossible to time the market anon, and I would never buy with borrowed funds personally
You&#039;re good dude the gains will outweigh the interest I&#039;m about to max another credit card
if you have reserve funds why the fuck did you take a loan? just use the reserve funds
&gt;&gt;2253304you will regret this decision for the rest of your life.
&gt;&gt;2253349they are mostly in my IRA
&gt;&gt;2253353it&#039;s only $11k manI have 4x that equity in my house, 3x that in my IRA, and 1x that in crypto already.If ETH crashes and burns, so be it, I won&#039;t be the worst off
&gt;&gt;2253304Do it. It will work out just fine. Trust me.
&gt;&gt;2253304Worth a shot desu... if works out you&#039;ll be stoked if not cut the loss lol
&gt;&gt;2253304It&#039;s very risky, you&#039;re betting on a loan in a volatile and very new market with little to show outside of small-scale implementation, potential, and hella speculation.That being said, if you play your cards right and diversify a bit I think you&#039;ll make gainz.
are you a troll? this has got to be a troll.if troll 6/10 for rustling some jimmies, if not 0/10 for being a dense fucking retard.
&gt;&gt;2253554what&#039;s trolling about this?I&#039;m being loaned money at a good rate and putting it to use in something I believe inthat&#039;s how the whole world works
&gt;&gt;2253304bretty good loan with ETH speculation driving the market to ATHsbuy the dip and it&#039;ll pay for itself easily
&gt;&gt;2253353Never take any risks, goy :^)So what just work some office job for the rest of my life?
&gt;&gt;2253576well i admit im not a financial expert, but i hardly ever take out loans. I either work more or find money some other way, because paying interest on loans or credit cards is literally just flushing money down the toilet every month
&gt;&gt;2253349&gt;&gt;2253353Because of the time value of money you mong. If he can service the debt why wouldn&#039;t he use leverage? Have you ever heard of a leveraged buyout? Literally the exact same concept.
&gt;&gt;2253586Taking on a loan to make more money is literally the opposite of this. The US higher education system, mortgage system, and the entire bond market is predicated on this concept...But i guess paying cash is the way to do things. 1931 called. They want you back.
&gt;&gt;2253304I&#039;m considering doing something similar with $20k that I can get for 6% APR
If you have no liquid funds why the fuck not! Nice risk play anon. If it corrects a bit don&#039;t worry. Just HODL
Taxes are going to negate any profit you could make. Breaking even at best.
I already put $22,000 in , and I&#039;m considering putting more in maybe even my savings, the problem is that I&#039;m addicted to seeing the percentage gains from having bought in around 160 to 180. And I remember that you should never put in more than you&#039;re willing to lose. I think I&#039;d be pissed off if I&#039;ve lost 100,000 to absolutely nothing.
&gt;&gt;2253586that&#039;s great but it&#039;s too small time for me at this point if I were to invest my own cashI&#039;ve been in crypto since 2012 and just watched my pithy initial investments snowball into something not quite as pithy. It&#039;s fucking annoying. Although I can see where blockchain technology is headed I can&#039;t make any money off of it because I have no starting capital. I got offered a nice loan rate and I think even if ETH plummits to zero I will still be fine. It would definitely sting but it wouldn&#039;t change my quality of life at all since I still sock money away in my IRA normally. My plan is if I get to 2x to pull out 1/2 and pay off the remaining principal.
&gt;&gt;2253610bullshit
&gt;&gt;2253542&gt;diversifymy current portfolio is:&gt;60% eth&gt;20% btc&gt;10% ltc&gt;5% ppc&gt;5% xmrI&#039;m thinking of putting most of it into eth since the upcoming btc uasf is a bit worrysome imo
&gt;&gt;2253610not if I hold for a year and just keep paying off my loan with my paycheck
&gt;&gt;2253304Never use leverage anon.It&#039;s nice until it destroys your life.
&gt;&gt;2253650When is it?
&gt;&gt;2253662whats wrong with it? as long as you have a real job and can make the payments I don&#039;t see a problem
&gt;&gt;2253662&gt;Never use leveragesee&gt;&gt;2253596What&#039;s the difference between using my IRA that&#039;s earning me well over 7% and using the bank&#039;s money? If ETH dies then I just take out my IRA money and pay the bank. It&#039;s the same fucking thing.&gt;&gt;2253669aug 1st
&gt;&gt;2253646get familiar with capital gains
&gt;&gt;2253677http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed&gt;Taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent tax brackets pay no tax on long-term gains on most assets
&gt;&gt;2253677I have and I&#039;m still calling bullshit
&gt;&gt;2253677&gt;get familiar with capital gainsAlso it&#039;s clear you are just FUDding since the term &quot;capital gains&quot; is in and of itself a GOOD thing for taxesIt means you get a lower tax rate than your normal income on certain long-term investments
&gt;&gt;2253304you&#039;re actually fucking retarded, ETH is set to tank for the next week LMAO
&gt;&gt;2253696&gt;calls someone retarded&gt;tries to time the market
&gt;&gt;2253304I&#039;m gonna be nice to you.Wait for a dip and buy $Shift.Thank me a month later.
&gt;&gt;2253596friend, i remind you of a few things. you are speaking as though it is a FOR SURE thing that eth is going to keep skyrocketing. it may, but it may not. it may dip or hover right where it is for the next 6 months. literally no one knows. also, like my grandfather always use to say, if its literally FREE money, guarenteed, then everyone and their monther would be doing exactly what you are. every human being on earth would take a 10k loan if they knew for certain they were getting 30k back. the fact is, there are a ton of variables and its a huge risk, and it is definitely not a &quot;for sure&quot; thing
&gt;&gt;2253710Wow! Thanks for the tip Mr. Noseberg
&gt;&gt;2253716Your loss.
&gt;&gt;2253714&gt;implying everyone and their mother is familiar with ethereum and how to purchase and store it&gt;implying everyone is familiar with the research I&#039;ve done on smart contracts and their potentialIt&#039;s not a FOR SURE thing, nothing is. But it&#039;s the most realistic option for me to make a decent chunk of money at this moment in timeI think the odds of ETH going up are a lot better than trying to land red on the roulettes in vegas and tons of people do that
&gt;&gt;2253726it does look interesting anon but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to get my money from the lender&gt;bank&gt;gemini&gt;bittrex fast enough to capitalize
&gt;&gt;2253304you are crazy if 6.9% is the best you could get lmao
&gt;&gt;2253756it&#039;s the best I could get with 3 day turnaround
&gt;&gt;2253756where can you do better?
&gt;&gt;2253714Did your grandfather also tell you what it was like before the dawn of the horseless carriage? Of course it isn&#039;t a sure thing, but if OP wants to get levered up and amplify his buying power, then he has every right to do so.&gt;&gt;2253695&gt;&gt;2253740Regarding capital gains, if I were to do this I&#039;d set up an S-Corp, name it &quot;Anon&#039;s Investment Bros, Inc.&quot; and use the interest on the loan as an expense to offset any investment income. Is also pay myself a salary and an &quot;employee of the month&quot; bonus and deduct that as payroll expenses. Then I&#039;d deduct the cost of my computer, my clothes (my work uniform), and my internet access. Suddenly, the &quot;company&quot; is just barely breaking even. Imagine that.
&gt;&gt;2253576Or invest at the right time, I mean his 11k will get him less ETH now than 500 would have gotten him 5 months ago. &quot;UUUUUUR DUUUUUUUUUUR BUT ITS STILL GONNA GO HIGHER&quot; - not the point. He was too stupid to get in early, he&#039;ll most likely be too stupid to get out in time too/make more life-not-changing mistakes.
&gt;&gt;2253349we got a faggot who doesn&#039;t understand how to leverage money right here
&gt;&gt;2253304&gt;Am I crazy?Yeah, you are doing idiocy, but besides that people take loans to buy this shit when its bubbling. Another top bubble indicator.God OP is such a moron
&gt;&gt;2253304Go all in, get all the credit cards. If things end up not working out, F it declare bankruptcy.
&gt;&gt;2253710&gt;please by this coin that got pumped todaygo back to your discord you pajeet
I&#039;m all in too.
I just got some pepecoins, I&#039;ll see you on the moon OP!
Sounds retarded tbqhBut atleast you dont shove it into posw or mooncoin tho DESU
Done the same OP on a 0%APR credit card but only $6k
&gt;ITT: An ETH holder pretends to have taken out a loan to purchase ETH to instill FOMO on potential ETH buyers and holders
Must feel good after those days that anons always looked down on us.Now we are flying to new heights and may even go interstellar!!!
I&#039;m holding 47k since 200 satsDOLLAR HERE WE COME

Help guys, what ICO looks good?(not mooncoin)
&gt;&gt;2259082get like 12 million of those, like i did
&gt;&gt;2259082What value did you find on it? Am I missing something here?
&gt;&gt;2259110ico are a scam my friend.

I take calculus, but my college offers business calculus for accounting and business majors. I&#039;m curious: what&#039;s involved in that class that&#039;s different from real calculus?
&gt;&gt;2259510Any math class &quot;for business&quot; or &quot;accounting math&quot; is a dumbed down version so the jocks can understand itTake real calculus and forget this shit
&gt;&gt;2259510Transcendental functions. e^x and trigonometric functions will either be missing entirely or introduced later in business calc. Whereas regular calc will assume that you know sin(x) and cos(x) from day one.
&gt;&gt;2259593This.If you do a pure maths course, you&#039;ll cover a months work of a business course in one week. I did both. The pure is way more fun though
&gt;&gt;2259593This. Business calculus is somewhere between precalculus and calculus 1 in difficulty. Oddly enough, though, I don&#039;t think you can sub calc 1 for business calculus on a degree plan. You can sub calc 2 for business calc, though.Just make sure you know your trigonometric functions, skip business calculus and take calc 1 if you really want to take calculus. If your degree plan requires you to take business calc, talk to your advisor to see if you can take calc 1 instead. You might get lucky, depending on what the head of the department says.
I just bought DGB for 1,2k sats, if it falls I&#039;m going to kill every single one of you guys who have been hyping it up.Specially the guy who posts the big titted dgb-san with increasingly boobs every now and then.
What do you hope to achieve by that?
My nigga...you bought at an all time high... At least hold until June 9th LMaO
lmao thanks for holding my bags while I buy in again at 30% discount in a few days
&gt;falling to FOMOIt almost never works out. Should have waited bro.
HOLD, BE STRONG. FOR LONGTERM, WHERE DO U SEE IT GO IN 1 MONTH ? 1 YEAR ? SHORT TERM DAY TRADERS WILL MAKE THE MARKET MOVE, PRICES WILL DROP THEN CLIMB BACK UP LIKE A LADDER. Although i bought at 750 :)
Welcome newbie! It will dip like every other coin in the market does, but don&#039;t shit your pants and keep holding as it will rise back up eventually.
&gt;&gt;2259366&gt;/biz/ tells you to buy at 20 sats&gt;You don&#039;t fucking listen&gt;It&#039;s now 1200 and you FINALLy fucking buy&gt;If it goes down it&#039;s our faultStupid cunt. If it drops below 20 sats then yeah, ok, that&#039;s our fault. Anything above 20 sats is just you being a stupid fucking cunt.
&gt;buy at ATH on the tip of a pump&gt;im gonna blame other people if the price goes down &gt;:(you deserve to hold the bags
&gt;&gt;2259384&gt;all time highNo, it was a dip. In fact, I&#039;m already up 1.04%. I bought it 5 minutes before making this thread.&gt;&gt;2259408NOT THE TIP
&gt;&gt;2259384This and if you have weak hands sell the news.Also DGBchan tax

&gt;&gt;2259454I bought in the bull trap and it is on the way to the &quot;return to &quot;normal&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;2259454That doesn&#039;t really apply to crypto. Only grandpa&#039;s stocks.
(I&#039;m joking btw, dj seems interesting)
&gt;&gt;2259524dj? what? I meant DGB
&gt;&gt;2259366Just wow. When you could have bought MoonCoin at 2 SATS instead you bought DGB at ATH... you could have multiplied you rmoney 200x instead it will fall by half...
&gt;&gt;2259454&gt;turns out the arrow should be pointing at &quot;the first selloff&quot;We bankers nao
good idea, it&#039;s probably just going to keep going up and up...dummy
&gt;&gt;2259366&gt;buying @ ath&gt;not waiting for the dipare u some special kind of retard?t. bought @ 600 sold @ 1300 and waiting for the dip to rebuy.
Are they stealth dumping?Are they prepping a perfect pump to take btc&#039;s throne?Riding the up-down waves for pocket change?Trying to kill cryptos?
&gt;&gt;2259235Problem with ETH is that even at hardcore level mining whales will be whales for the next 50 years.
Once I noticed the stagnation I converted all my ETH back into BTC and traded for altcoinsSo far I&#039;m making bank with that decision
&gt;&gt;2259235I think the current ETH valuation is a scam to accumulate BTC.
&gt;&gt;2259235&gt;why are they dumpingto get out of a coin before it crashes you fucking retard holy shit
&gt;&gt;2259316&gt;&gt;2259288Only newfags don&#039;t realize that ETH plays this stagnation and dip game every month or so for a few weeks before it literally doubles in price and then goes quiet again.
When is the global elite putting an end to this? Common people are making money.
&gt;&gt;2258459By the time we&#039;re all done it will be too late for them.
Don&#039;t worry as soon as polo exitscams all your imaginary earnings will disappear in a matter of an hour
&gt;&gt;2258598Keeping your money on exchanges
&gt;&gt;2258635&gt;
&gt;&gt;2258459&gt;fallling for the conspiracy memeThe global elite don&#039;t give a shit I reckon, they have bigger problems to worry about.Faggot #2258459 making 10 grand off of PnDing his dumpstercoin is probably not in their field of vision.
&gt;&gt;2258459&gt;elites allowing a chick a seat at the table
&gt;&gt;2258763It&#039;s a girl(boy)
&gt;&gt;2258763how do you explain hillary clinton or queen elizabeth?
&gt;&gt;2258763its an offering to the ayyy lmao.
&gt;&gt;2258672The global elite probably want a much larger population of millionaires, and fresh young money on the scene.It makes sense, majority of lambourghinis just sit in the car lot
They&#039;re just getting in on it themselves. Do you really think the people buying tens of millions worth of BAT and selling it for quadruple the price are people like us? The richest man in the world is balls deep in crypto, this train has no breaks and nocoiners are going to be on suicide watch in a few years. They don&#039;t care if a few NEETs make a few piddly millions when they&#039;ll be making billions if not trillions.
&gt;&gt;2258818&gt;this train has no breaks and nocoiners are going to be on suicide watch in a few years.im in this to btfo the normies and globalists. i seriously believe we will be at least $300 billion total market cap by the end of the year.So happy to be a part of this journey boyo.
&gt;&gt;2258856&gt;im in this to btfo the normies and globalistsWell you&#039;re in for bad news because globalists are in on this too. Look at Gates for instance, the only people who will be btfo are normalfags, particularly boomers.
&gt;&gt;2258903This is true. The boomers are fucked. I have been a part of this for only 4 months but wew lad... I can&#039;t even tell my friends about the zort.
&gt;&gt;2258804This desu. They offer each generation a test of admittance.
&gt;&gt;2258658Ty
&gt;&gt;2258635It doesn&#039;t matter where you keep them the price of your shit will tank if any major exchange gets &#039;hacked&#039;
&gt;&gt;2258925&gt;The boomers are fuckedgood
&gt;&gt;2258903&gt;the only people who will be btfo are normalfags, particularly boomers.if thats the only victory im more than happy.I know there are many global billionaires investing but all in all a blockchain based cryptocurrency is not in the best interests of the elites, hence they are actively discouraging its use.Dont you
&gt;&gt;2259032Eh, invest in the coins that benefit the bankers.
&gt;&gt;2258928That test usually involves sacrificing children unfortunately
&gt;&gt;2258635I&#039;m using bittrex and never had any issues, if you fuck up yourself don&#039;t blame it on polo
&gt;&gt;2258792mere icons or puppet idols
They&#039;re not going to put an end to this for the same reason the middleclass people who become upper middleclass through responsible spending aren&#039;t stopped: millionaires are not a threat to billionaires. Their wealth tends to disappear within two generations, as kids born in upper middle class environments don&#039;t have the same drive to succeed.In fact, millionaires are quite helpful in selling the illusion you, too, can make it in this society, that there is upward mobility and that the top fortunes aren&#039;t centuries old money and people who bent the knee to them.
&gt;&gt;2259032Implying governments wont work with bankers to issue their own cryptos fully under their control and ban all the shit we are trading.GL to us all.
&gt;&gt;2259470fucking this.They want us to chase becoming millionaires while they control governments.
&gt;&gt;2259495It&#039;s probably gonna be collections of governments issueing cryptos because globalism
&gt;&gt;2259470gotta agree, if you happen to become millionaire or just wealthy, If you have kids there is good chance next generations will simply waste your efforts, especially with the waves of degeneracy + shit education system
&gt;&gt;2259607old money stays rich (private education blah blah). new money gets rekt in like 3 generations max. Sad things is even if we know this shit we cant do jack shit about it.
&gt;&gt;2259495&gt;banning certain coinswon&#039;t work, cat&#039;s out of the bag at this point, and even if it is banned people will find ways to publish the source code to wallets and miners, like when Phil Zimmerman was indicted by the US government for writing/exporting PGP and he said fuck you and published the source code in a book.
Thanks for shilling ETH on /Pol, you did me a solid.This is what hodling looks like, highlighted in red was last weeks crash.Will it all end in disaster? Maybe, but I&#039;ve bet what I can afford to lose, and if it reaches even 1 percent of the human population we will all be rich.
&gt;&gt;2257897Can you do me a solid and get me some reddcoin, ill pay you back when im rich
&gt;&gt;2259309stfu nigger
&gt;&gt;2257897are u me?
Remember, Anon: The only way to beat the Jew is to become the Jew. Coincidentally, Golem is a Jew coin. You might be able to make money off it, but I&#039;d recommend not buying it. Buy RLC, REP, and ANT instead. Also, get BAT when it hits the exchanges.
Tainting things with /pol/ is the dumbest shit. It&#039;s like you guys want the bubble to pop 10x earlier than usual. They&#039;re literally a direct link to normies and meme evolution spreads out of control with them.
Man in 5 years time, when Quantum Computing evolves to a point of application in cyber security, this shits all gonna get overhauled anyway.
If I buy btc or eth, or some other shit coin, do I have to pay taxes on them? Assume I&#039;m not ever going to cash out in fiat.
&gt;&gt;2258465Are you American? Then yes... You owe capital gains on your gains.The IRS is offing new guidance in the coming weeks, though, so I fully expect to get rammed in the ass when they present their proposals to Congress.
&gt;&gt;2258465Tax man wont know what you have in your hidden wallet.However if you turn that to fiat currency and don&#039;t want to launder it then you should pay your taxes
&gt;&gt;2258479&gt;&gt;2258483Yes, I&#039;m american. I just don&#039;t understand how they can tax you in crypto, when it&#039;s not even getting coverted to &quot;real money&quot; at all. Is there some official government taxes page with info on this?
So whats today&#039;s meme?
&gt;&gt;2259221
&gt;&gt;2259221
Stupid frogposter.Stupid beanposters.
fuck off beanfucks
&gt;&gt;2259221BitBay looks ready to blast off
siacoin just hit 420, nice profits already for those whom bought few days ago
&gt;&gt;2259503If we&#039;re talking about pumps and dumps there&#039;s no need to invest in anything over 200 sats. That&#039;s the only purpose shitcoins have anyway,
What&#039;s a generally good fee for buying bitcoin?I assume Coinbase&#039;s 3.75% fee is the standard?Credit card btw
&gt;&gt;2259090What&#039;s Kraken&#039;s fee?Been reading this shit all day and people say Coinbase is Jew.
&gt;&gt;22590901.49%&gt;he spends over 2x in fees as i do because he NEEDS THE MONEY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!This is why you will fail.
1%
&gt;&gt;2259108&gt;he pays a higher fee to not risk having his bank account tied to his marketplace
&gt;&gt;2259122I pay less than half of OP. what are you smoking
&gt;&gt;2259122just open a new bank account, are you retarded?
&gt;&gt;2259148So that&#039;s the question OP was asking. Where can you buy btc with a credit card for the lowest fee. Not &quot;where can I buy btc with the lowest fee, even if that means it&#039;s an bank account transfer and takes 3 days to post&quot;
&gt;&gt;2259090Is that the original JUST photo? I&#039;ve only seen that crop of hair pasted on every kind of photo imaginable... holy fuck that is hilarious
&gt;&gt;2259179&gt;http://i.imgur.com/K2gr0Dj.jpgGoogle his name, he has videos on youtube. Its comedy gold
&gt;&gt;2259090lol what fucking fee?Transfer money to account on Coinbase USD wallet, transfer that money to Gdax, buy with a limit order on Gdax.No fee, not even a small maker/taker fee. Literally 0 in fees. What the fuck is wrong with you cucks not doing this??
bittstoreuk@protonmail.com , I will need verification depending on payment method I can sell you upto 5 BTCI can show that I am a trusted trader on LBC, hit me up if you faggots need any
Tfw pay zero fees with sepa bank transfer and limit orders on gdaxFeels good man
&gt;&gt;2259179I found ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUipkWVbaQw
You would have almost $10,000,000 right now if you put a measly $10,000 in STRAT 11 months ago. If that doesn&#039;t make you want to kill yourself, I don&#039;t know what will.
&gt;&gt;2259189&gt;IFNah bro dont hurt yourself like that
&gt;&gt;2259210This is why I am putting like $1,000 in anything that is close to ICO price and had a good idea and team. I wasn&#039;t around when STRAT was at ICO and had taken a break from crypto at the time. I wish i stuck around for one more fucking month to see this.
&gt;&gt;2259189Hindsight fallacy
What is it with traders and suicide?What&#039;s the point of having a gorillion dollars and being this brittle?
&gt;&gt;2259189anyone is a fucking genius with monday&#039;s paper. Fuck off OP
I&#039;ll have two grand next week. Small fries, but more than I&#039;ve ever had to deop on crypto. What should I do?
DGB and XBY are currently running to a dollar.XRP, GNT, REP, ANT, XEM are solid holds thru the end of the year.Buy some ETH just to give yourself some stability.
&gt;&gt;2259452Either what this anon said or spend some time on /biz/ waiting for a pump and dump coin to get heavily shilled, put your btc into it, keep watching for a few days and sell when ready.
DECRED VS NEM FOR LONG TERM HOLDSOMEONE HELP
&gt;&gt;2259476NEMWhen I googled Decred there were results on the first page about it being a scam I don&#039;t want a tainted coin
&gt;&gt;2259452&gt;ETH just to give yourself some stabilitydamn straight, Vitalik puts bread on the table
I predicted BTCD, HUC and XPM, the only other solid prediction I have had that hasn&#039;t come true yet is Florincoin.Should be a quickish (~2 weeks) return but I wouldn&#039;t bet everything on it.
Why is no one talking about the Polibus ICO? Is biz only a bandwagon train ? Is this the place for all the shrills and dumps ? Once it get&#039;s on biz, coin has already been pumped.&quot;Polybius is a project aimed to create a regulated bank for the digital generation. Not sure about the total supply, but seems like it&#039;s going to be whatever is bought during the ico. But def a great buy. Thank my later biz :)
&gt;&gt;2259431&gt;Polybus: The regulated blockchainNobody fucking wants regulation in this market, it looks like utter shit
How much are they selling it per unit, it&#039;s already so heavily invested in the gains will likely be fucking trash again
&gt;&gt;2259431Also this. Why is it beneficial in any way to have a &#039;regulated&#039; blockchain. What does that mean in laymens terms ?
Seriously, I can only buy on BTCMarkets which is hypeinflated, then move it onto poloniex or one of those markets, whilst again getting gouged on transaction fees along the way. Then if I ever need to sell out I&#039;m trapped with some fucking maze to get my money back in AUD.Is there a better solution to this, or is this it?Desperate to hear some serious answers to this.
&gt;&gt;2257801&gt;BTCMarkets which is hypeinflatedWRONGim an ausfag and have made over 30 grand in the last 3 WEEKS via btcmarkets.stop being a dumb cunt and learn maths.
If you&#039;re a smart frog you can very easily make that 20% or whatever back in a couple of days (or minutes depending on these digits ^^^^).
&gt;&gt;2257801Fellow ausfagBuy from coinjar or bit tradeMove to polo to tradeSell through coinjar straight into bank account.I&#039;ve sold to coinjar twice in the last week. No issues
&gt;he plans on cashing out to fiat
&gt;&gt;2257825I mean even in terms of simply getting my AUD onto polo, I&#039;m copping a major loss. I&#039;m wondering if there is a more efficient way, although I guess not.
&gt;&gt;2257863CoinjarIt&#039;s like 1%
&gt;&gt;2257902Absolutely go with coinjar
&gt;&gt;2257905&gt;&gt;2257902Thank you very much lads, that is solid advice!I had money on BTCMarkets so I just re-bought BTC and sent that over to Polo. Now I nervously wait for it to appear....
&gt;&gt;22579021% but significantly higher btc price than btc marketsit basically all evens out between fees and inflation just deal with it
LocalBitcoin
&gt;&gt;2257919Yeah but the split in btc price isn&#039;t that much so you also sell high.
&gt;&gt;2257807&gt;stop being a dumb cunt and learn maths.Like what
&gt;&gt;2257801Fucking hell, it says &quot;febreze&quot; on the bottle. I knew we&#039;ve switched timelines
what do you lads think of coinspot? I&#039;m using that one currently. should I go to coinjar instead?
&gt;&gt;2257801https://twitter.com/BTCPrice_Live - THIS!!!
Independent Reserve is another au exchange worth checking out
&gt;&gt;2257801I know fellow aus anon, how absolute shit is it, not only because it requires so many more hoops to send money around but also because in the event of a crash, you&#039;re completely fucked by the time you pull BTC from Polo into BTC Markets and try sell that shit. On the plus side, the inflation in BTC Markets will help when cashing out should the need arise.In any case look at https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets and search for &quot;BTC/AUD&quot; - BTC Markets is the only exchange listed and pretty sure from looking at all the other &quot;exchanges&quot; that deal with AUD, they all just route through BTC Markets and pocket the difference that they charge.&gt;&gt;2257902BTC Markets is like 0.85% commission although don&#039;t know what the BTC prices are on Coinjar, but on BTC Markets they&#039;re always like 8% - 12% higher than the AUD equivalent of the BTC/USDT rate on Polo&gt;&gt;2258144Just don&#039;t, I started buying through Coinspot when I didn&#039;t know shit about buying into Bitcoin... all their currencies are literally held within Poloniex wallets (confirmed from looking at transaction history and wallet details, was sending coins from Coinspot to Polo and funny enough they left and were sent to the same wallet), also they basically buy your bitcoin at a super premium, seriously not worth besides that they give you instant poli payments of up to $5k opposed to BTC Markets measly $2k (which also takes 2 days to complete until you can deposit more)
Coinjar and poloniex ya nub
Does anyone think this can go to 20+ by the end of a couple of months? really considering buying thislike it seems like a good buy, good idea, good dev, good planning. like it just seems too good to be true. but it mooned already, so was just wondering opinions on it
Boys, its pumping right now.. This will be as big as ETH someday.. You have been told
Shh stop talking about it
&gt;&gt;2256293youre right, nothing happening.. dont buy stratis folks.. shows over *whistles*
&gt;&gt;2256293This.Please refrain from talking about it until I can accumulate more
&gt; like it just seems too good to be true.Well, I bet the people who bought It 3 months ago thought the same thing.
This is the dullest coin ever. Literally nothing to see here. Buy some more DGB and go the fuck to sleep.
Dont buy stratis. Stay away from stratis. Stick to ethereum.*silently places buy orders*
fuck its risingsold at 26.8khoping it comes down ti at least 25.2k again, the bollinger bands demand it
&gt;&gt;2256365dont buy stratis.. take your profits and never look back..Everyone, stay away from stratis!
&gt;&gt;2256378im so pissedsaging btw, i know the rules around here
&gt;&gt;2256381I&#039;m bumping just to ruin it for you. You apparently don&#039;t know the rules after all.
The question is:Should I hold, or try selling now to buy again at the dip? When the dip will be?Decisions..
&gt;&gt;2256387sage all stratis threads newfagthis coin is coveted
&gt;&gt;2256381its against the rules to tell someone you&#039;re saging them you niggersaged
Sell your stratises.. it will crash! Dont get stuck bagholding! Buy more DGB!
ive been watching the charts, and this coin is literally mooning like 24/7. i keep waiting for it to dip for a while and cool off so i can buy a bunch. but it just keeps going higher
heh. I&#039;m going to leave for a few hours, and not sure if I should sell before it falls.
&gt;&gt;2256434The dip happened yesterday, it went from $6 to $4,90. Actually, it had several dips from 6 to 5, should have bought at those.
Also, now is a good time to buy, look at the sell vs buy.
&gt;&gt;2256469dont buy it.. forget stratis
It&#039;s mooning right fucking now faggotsGet the fuck in here
Holy shit, fucker is mooning like crazy.I hope this isn&#039;t a pump and dump
Bought this shit last week not expecting huge profits but god damn, thank god I jumped out of DGB for this.
REEEEEEEEE
&gt;&gt;2256524DGB is mooning right now, fuck off
Bought in at 1$&gt;mfw
Whats the point? isnt this an ETH clone?
Just sold all mine. Got out before the suckers.Having a &quot;Once biz hypes it, sell&quot; mentality has made me 50,000 in the past year.
For those of you not part of the bagholding shill team, what&#039;s the possible reason for this surge? Status coming out in mid-June? Sounds like a buy the rumor sell the news type thing.
&gt;&gt;2257463breeze wallet i think
&gt;&gt;2257506breeze wallet and the dev announcing that companies developing their own chains with stratis will be required to lock coins
&gt;&gt;2256287$100 by 2018 just hodl and buy more
Eth went from 7$ to 230$ in 6 months , clearly stratis will be 100$ in summer
&gt;&gt;2257267It&#039;s better than ETH
&gt;tfw placed a sell order at 0.0034 and went to sleep&gt;It keeps going upWell, now I want to buy more but don&#039;t want to lose money. Do you think it&#039;s gonna dip?
&gt;&gt;2259359&gt;Do you think it&#039;s gonna dip?At some point.Maybe from 0.0055 to 0.0043 or some shit.
&gt;&gt;2259392I hope you are wrong, placed a buy order at 0.033, let&#039;s pray it goes down.
COUNTDOWN TO 1000 SATS
&gt;&gt;2250413Dude, I was watching as the 900 SAT (120BTC) sell wall get instantly blown out. This shit is going to the moon.
&gt;&gt;2250413Coming in a couple days. Need to put a handle on this cup first. I&#039;m thinking we will get closer to 1.3k sats before it starts losing steam.
&gt;&gt;2250423&gt;DGB&gt;ever losing steamIt will be $1 by year end. Screencap this.
&gt;mfw the non-believers witness the ascent to 50 cents by the end of summer
&gt;&gt;2250413&gt;got only 10k DGBwill I make it?
400 BTC increase in volume in the last few hours!!
And to think I almost sold all my DGB for LTC
&gt;&gt;2250413It&#039;s getting dumped now. Time yo get out.
&gt;&gt;2250413&gt;Tfw sold at 885 because I expected it to hit resistance and reboundCurse these shaky hands
&gt;&gt;2250519Retard alert
Sell wall to 1000 keeps getting larger, ITS GONNA CRASH AGAIN, GET OUT GET OUThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPfa5VuTVN4When you come to itand you cant go do ityou cant knock it downyou know that you foundTHE WALL (WHAT) THE WALL THE WALL
&gt;&gt;2250519Got out at 935 have fun bagholders :&#039;)
&gt;&gt;2250532Retard alert
&gt;&gt;2250413You retards have to realize that this thing will be well over 1000 sats and heading to 2000 on June 8th.
&gt;&gt;2250568&gt;&gt;2250588No proof as to why it&#039;s being dumped, it&#039;s just being dumped right?It&#039;s not like it has been following the same pattern the past few days seeing massive increases and then calming down? Even if it does dip now, it will go back higher following the same pattern.Looks like it&#039;s already back to 930. I hope you regret your sell you weak handed pussy.
&gt;tfw bought in today at 700 sats or so and sold at 850 satsNNIKQQAS I SHUD HAVE HODLDDED
Look at these buys, holy shit. Somebody definitely knows something we do not.
&gt;&gt;2250607over 930 within 1 minute of you posting this. Only retards aren&#039;t HODL DGB right now.
Should I buy more now?
&gt;&gt;2250620Yes near an all time high what could possibly go wrong
&gt;&gt;2250568get a load of no-coins here.
&gt;&gt;2250620yes
&gt;&gt;2250620DO EET FAGGOT
&gt;&gt;2250620it&#039;ll be over 1k by tonight, maybe 1,500
&gt;&gt;2250620I wouldn&#039;t, dgb has tried to break 1000 sats so many times and it keeps failing.
&gt;&gt;2250620Considering the massive buys at 930, I think it&#039;s a fair entry point for what&#039;s next.
&gt;&gt;2250644It has a couple nasty sell walls coming up but it has been blowing shit out all day.
&gt;&gt;2250653you think that sell wall at 1k is real? lol
&gt;&gt;2250650&gt;so many timesWhat? Once before? This is the second time it has risen this high.There&#039;s really nothing supporting a major crash happening near 1k. Sell walls have been continuously removed the past few days to ramp up the price and then keep it at a steady level.
&gt;&gt;2250653Very tough sell walls. Hopefully those will get pulled and we can continue upward.
&gt;&gt;2250666Come on satan, the only bad sell wall is the one at about 170 BTC around 970 sats. The rest will vanish like they have been.
&gt;&gt;2250653I think we all know what happens next.
&gt;&gt;2250650&gt;So many times&gt;A single time @ ATHPick one you fucking goy
&gt;&gt;2250568JUST
Sell now, the technology behind this coin doesn&#039;t even work you mongs. The devs are autistic too.
&gt;30k dgbI hate myself for selling half of it at 650 sat
&gt;&gt;2250697kek at that id
&gt;&gt;2250698I had 150k and sold 100k at 650 3 days ago literally hours before this bull rally
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBdat4QeEr8new thread theme song.
Only retards or whales are selling right now.
Any opinions on Ripple? Big rally today, I might reinvest my earnings from DGB into that. Bought in at 500 Satoshi and sold twice at 750 and 850, not too bad if I say so myself.Not sure about DGBs future - the hype for the supposed &quot;win&quot; at the conference on the 10th is pushing prices up massively but I don&#039;t expect an immature coin like it to win. I bet prices will crash either just before or during that conference.
&gt;&gt;2222222ye of little faith, repent
&gt;&gt;2250422&gt;sell wall get instantly blown outso the whale finally cancelled the order so the price moves?
&gt;&gt;2250760Even if it loses the contest, I cant see it crashing. It will dro to 700 sats at worst, only to rise again
&gt;&gt;2250760I margin bought XRP with my DGB gains
That 1k sell wall is the stratosphere, we&#039;re going straight through it.
&gt;&gt;2250789STR* not XRP my bad. Should ave gone with XRP though.
Congrats to the new bagholders, this baby is going down.
&gt;&gt;2250753Lol ok look at the chart and tell me who the retard is now.
&gt;&gt;2250697&gt;&gt;2250729kekd&gt;&gt;2250698&gt;&gt;2250730i got in at 660. there&#039;s life in this yet, but a hurdle approaches with the competition. what if they lose? what if nothing fruitful comes of it?
&gt;&gt;2250820&gt;&gt;2250823You guys are still retards.This is what happens when you never look at a coin&#039;s history and you just day trade like an idiot.Only looking at the 5min chart doesn&#039;t work. Sell/buy orders and history are just as important as all of the charts.
&gt;&gt;2250823it&#039;s pretty normal for coins to swing by 5% in minutes. DGB&#039;s overall trajectory is heading for 10 cents, possibly within weeks at this point&gt;tell me who the retard is now.You?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhG-vLZrb-gmfw they fell for the PnD again.
&gt;&gt;2250413sooo HODL? or wat?
&gt;&gt;2250856HODL nigger.
it&#039;s up over a 100 sats from 3 hours ago.we&#039;re not exactlly fuckedfucked
&gt;&gt;2250842&gt;&gt;2250848I&#039;ve been on this train since 106 sats. Trust me I know how this works. The whales were accumulating at 500-700 sats, pumped to a little over 900 and sold. All the activity now is just the little guys buying and selling to one another.
&gt;&gt;2250880&lt;---- Actually this whale accumulated at the low 400s and started making threads about it.Easiest 100% profit.
&gt;&gt;2250880Mate that already happened last ATH since that was a pump&#039;n&#039;dump too wasn&#039;t it? Why didn&#039;t you sell there?If it was dumping then it would be at an 800 floor already I&#039;m sure.Why would you enter at 106, follow it all this way, and then sell off like a pussy once it starts getting close to the ATH? Have you not actually been following it and you just look at the price?This coin is much more steady than most. Look at the price again. Over 1k BTC in buy orders on Polo. Tell me it&#039;s a dump.
&gt;&gt;2250565&gt;&gt;2250650&gt;&gt;2250735&gt;&gt;2250820&gt;&gt;2250854
&gt;&gt;2250908Yeah I got fucked on the last ATH and sold around 880 and then bought back in because of retards like you constantly saying MUH 1000 SATS MUH 1 DOLLAR DGB. I think 800 will likely be the new &quot;normal&quot; but it isn&#039;t going to 1000 sats today.
&gt;&gt;2250962Wow.So you actually bought in early because of /biz/ hype, sold too early, bought in higher like a retard, got burned, and are now you did the exact same thing?Also, if 800 is the new &quot;normal&quot; like you say, then that means it&#039;s following the pattern of increasing higher steadily each day. That means it&#039;s a good hold. Why did you sell?
&gt;&gt;2250413SELLL SELLLL SELLLLLL
&gt;&gt;2250990HODLLL HODLLLL HODLLLL
&gt;&gt;2250983So I can trade on margin. I didn&#039;t realize loan rates were at .15%. It&#039;s basically free money. You amplify your profits by 300% pretty much. I also have just realized that it&#039;s going to hover a little below my sell point so I can go use my current profits to make more on margin and then roll that back in to DGB if things start looking up.
Howl, I mean HODL
This is as high as it&#039;s ever going to get, SELLSELLSELL
&gt;&gt;2251015HODL THESE
&gt;&gt;2251015SELLLL SELLLLL SELLLL AND BUY THE DIP!!
&gt;&gt;2251052I am hodling hardlo

&gt;&gt;2251273&gt;&gt;2251106
June 22nd
DGB really is the gift that keeps on giving. Selling my worthless ETH now and pick up on my losses by buying DGB. I&#039;m done with ETH forever after this, ETC/STRAT are better anyway.
Should I buy DGB now and hold or wait until 800 sat and buy then?
&gt;&gt;2251229&gt;he thinks the coin is gonna go 5x in the next 9 days when it cant even break 1kyou poor poor soul
Former DGB bag holder here. Not gonna lie it&#039;s hilarious watching DGB crash and burn but in all seriousness we can&#039;t let them get to $10
you can start calling me RICHard
Former DGB bag holder here. Not gonna lie it&#039;s hilarious watching DGB crash and burn but in all seriousness we can&#039;t let them get to $555
who else holding
&gt;&gt;2251675every one with balls not made of porridge
&gt;&gt;2251675Hodling like never hodled before
Someone tell me what the fucking point is of all these alternative crypto currencies? Literally no one will use them to buy shit. It&#039;s just for rich people to pump the stock and the jump off to get even richer, isn&#039;t it?
&gt;&gt;2251725Yes. I think it&#039;s funny people think that a currency that could double or halve in value over night could ever go mainstream.
&gt;&gt;2251725ask yourself that same question in a year.
&gt;&gt;2251738That&#039;s what people have been saying about bitcoins for years but very few people actually use them to buy legit products. Who the fuck wants to buy with a currency which can increase by 1000% in a couple of months?
&gt;&gt;2251749It&#039;s time to visit Japan
&gt;&gt;2250413HODL MY HAND U CUUCK
&gt;&gt;2251749you really are this short sighted aren&#039;t you?
&gt;&gt;2251749stay poor faggot
Mfw /biz/ DGB shills have already made me 100 dollars stronger.
&gt;&gt;2252040DGB hodler here, tell me why altcoins are the future.In our current economic system we do not use different currencies in different industries. There&#039;s no Lumberdollar, no Steeldollar, no Coaldollar. The only currencies that have any value are national and international currencies like USD/CAD/AUD, the euro, the pound, the peso, et cetera. Why would themed currency for use in different industries - like DGB is associated with gaming, POT with marijuana trade, trumpcoin, dogecoin, blah blah blah - ever catch on?Maybe BTC/ETH/something would. I just don&#039;t see any altcoins sticking around long term.
&gt;&gt;2252068up about $1500 here. Better than a kick in the teeth but now I wish I had gone all in
&gt;&gt;2252081Because 10 years from now global trade will be done only in crypto and there won&#039;t be central banks or any need for localized fiat currency anymore.
&gt;&gt;2252113There&#039;s no chance in hell this happens within 10 years.
&gt;&gt;2252113Wouldn&#039;t a unified currency make a lot more sense and be a lot more efficient? Do you really think it will catch on the way it works right now, trading fiat for BTC and then trading that for Alts? Because I don&#039;t. Also, do you really think ten years is a generous enough time frame for that kind of drastic switch?Not being a dick by challenging you or anything. At least not intentionally. I just can&#039;t wrap my head around the notion of altcoins being worth anything long term, or fiat ever really going away.
I AM A PROUD MOONCOIN HOLDER, AND I DETEST EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, DGB SHILLSMOONCOIN &gt; DIGIBYTEJust kidding, though.
&gt;&gt;2252136&gt;Also, do you really think ten years is a generous enough time frame for that kind of drastic switch?The global fiat market is due for a crash at some point in the next 10 years, probably sooner. When that happens, crypto will be the only thing there to take its place and trillions of dollars will pour in overnight, making it the de facto way to conduct trade from that point forward.
This is glorious, DGB is SKYROCKETING at moment and NO ONE is shilling it here anymore, this is a fucking GEM
940sats niggers. Keep HODL
&gt;&gt;2252136the time for adoption of new technologies is exponential. Look at internet or cellphones. And in terms of currencies, look at the euro. You are right there are no &quot;currencies&quot; for individual industries, but there are index funds, mutual funds, ETFs, futures, and other devices that are used to monetize on industry and profit when that industry is expected to do well.
&gt;&gt;2252136you cash out shit tons of alts into BTC.
If you can&#039;t see DGB breaking 1000 any day now you are a complete moron.
&gt;&gt;2252428It&#039;s been funny watching goyims panic sell all day at 900 sat then watching it go back up to 940 in 5 minutes.
&gt;&gt;2251346price is manipulated since ever.Anyone who is following DGB since last year on Polo knows that whales are manipulating.When the bags are heavy enough, they allow 1k+.
&gt;&gt;2252451You buy at 940 and sell at 900.Goyims gonna goy.
12 BTC sell wall at 924 on bittrex
We&#039;re just gonna stop at the moon for drinks and some chips. Then Mars!!!
&gt;&gt;2252645Fuck Mars man I want to go to Pluto that shit looks lit
&gt;&gt;2250413MFWI bought 86k DGB for 0.1 BTCITS 0.8 BTC NOWI could have had a 1.6k profit
Is it too late to buy now
&gt;&gt;2253146Yes
This will go to 1200 MAX and fall back to 500 again.Just sell at the next moon or you&#039;ll be sorry.If you really believe this has &quot;potenttial&quot; you&#039;re kidding yourselfs.
&gt;&gt;2253262&gt;Citibank competition&gt;League of Legends&gt;Minecraft&gt;CS:GO&gt;no potential
Can someone send me a miniscule amount of DGB through my id to check if it works- The QR code works but the rest seems to be faulty.&gt;If you think I&#039;m scamming for less than a cent honestly kill yourself
&gt;&gt;2253262Said the same thing at 200 sats you fag. Stop resisting.
&gt;&gt;2253958Why don&#039;t you just send one to yourself through an exchange account?
&gt;&gt;2250413Sold 2 bitcoins night before crash and bought DGB. I&#039;ve been doing pretty well so far in this game - been managing to buy at all the dips and highs and reinvest back into more coins.
&gt;saw it at ~450 a few days ago&gt;Hadn&#039;t set up my account yet&gt;wanted to buy this&gt;ended up buying PIXV instead&gt;tfw could&#039;ve made $100 instead of $10

Cannot see them fudders anymore
Just a reminder that it&#039;s going to dip.BUT YOU GOTTA HOLD ON TIGHT BOIZ.
&gt;&gt;2255333&gt;get in at the a peak
You guys realize that bitcoin isn&#039;t stable at it&#039;s current price and is gonna crash again soon right?
&gt;&gt;2257428yup, thx mister hedge.
&gt;&gt;2257428wtf I&#039;m selling my btc now
&gt;&gt;2257428And we&#039;ll be right there to buy the dip :P.t.sold at $2600
That&#039;s what happens when the new money starts to dry up. I&#039;m feeling like huge correction is just around the corner as well. Probably somewhere between $1500-$1800. When people start to get hysterical saying things like &quot;omg million dollar bitcoins!!&quot; It&#039;s a good indicator that shit is probably going bad soon.
you realize you&#039;re a faggot?
&gt;he thinks current fiat value is relevantHave fun getting double-taxed cashing in and out while I grow my number of btcs multiplies.
&gt;&gt;2257502You sound upset.&gt;&gt;2257513Trades between alt coins are still subject to taxes and you don&#039;t get double taxed. Any trade you make is subject to capital gains unless they are held for more than a year.
&gt;&gt;2257530you sound like a faggot
&gt;&gt;2257533Cry more baby man.
&gt;&gt;2257428neither is ETHit will return to $150-$200
Yeah but I&#039;m not smart enough to know for sure, plus I got another $20k to drop on crypto, plenty to buy the dip so ima just hold
&gt;&gt;2257428thx for the information, good to know mister shekelstein, i will sell my btc immediately!
&gt;&gt;2257530I thought if you hold them less than a year it&#039;s treated as income tax, and over a year it&#039;s capital gains. Which is much less in taxes.
&gt;&gt;2257567Nope less than a year it&#039;s capital gains. More than a year you don&#039;t have to pay capital gains if you are in the lowest tax bracket.http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp
&gt;&gt;2257559Well I guess I&#039;m wrong Mr. Goldstine. I should probably buy more right now! It can only go up from here!!! Up up up. 10k next month!
&gt;&gt;2257530&gt;everyone is taxed the same as the jurisdiction i am in
That&#039;s what they were saying when it hit $100
&gt;&gt;2257530&gt;Trades between alt coins are still subject to taxesProvide the proofs.Altcoins have no value in fiat currency, how could they be taxed?
&gt;&gt;2257652&gt;what is a false equivalence
&gt;&gt;2257659If you can mathematically identify BTC&#039;s &quot;fundamental&quot; value then I&#039;ll concede. Most people thought it was overvalued at $100, with a minority of proto-pumpers disagreeing
&gt;&gt;2257668It doesn&#039;t matter what you think it&#039;s value is. What matters is what people are willing to pay for it and if you look at the price now it&#039;s stagnant because the flow of new money coming in. How big was the market cap when it was selling at $100. It&#039;s a lot different than it is now and your argument is invalid.
&gt;&gt;2257658It does have value in fiat currency though. All profits you make are subject to taxes and if you don&#039;t pay them, and they catch, you you&#039;ll have your money seized and go to jail.
SELL EUR/USD FAST!!!
MORE INFO COMING!
NONFARM PAYROLLS AAAAHHHHHHHHHH
&gt;&gt;2257882Please elaborate
PLEASE BE THE CRASH PLEASE BE A FUCKING CRASH IM SOOO REAADYYY LLEEETTTSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why are people buying this dip? Fucking kek all the S and P growth is based on complete bullshit and no fundamentals if this market fucking rallies
nice try faggot
The fuck is this shit I don&#039;t trust it, I don&#039;t even have to sync to a network?
&gt;&gt;2256790I like it.
&gt;&gt;2256881I don&#039;t understand its security
&gt;&gt;2256790I prefer Exodus but that&#039;s me.
&gt;&gt;2256790using it for 2 weeks, no problems so far
Bugged the hell out for me on my android firefox and chrome on any currency but btc.
hi I&#039;m new to the crypto world , just joined some exchange markets (coinbase,poloniex,bittrex,kraken) now my question is which wallet should i buy for some BTH , ETH and some others altcoins when I&#039;m not trading? thanks in advance!
&gt;&gt;2256790You shouldn&#039;t trust it. They are incompetent and are teaming up with blatant scams like bytecoin.
&gt;&gt;2256790the code isn&#039;t open source but it is allegedly exposed on their website, also the keys are, again, allegedly, never sent to themcannot confirm since I didn&#039;t bother to read the code, and probably wouldn&#039;t be able to find that part
I wanna show 0-60 videos and go over different car models. Would I be able to monetize these?
&gt;&gt;2259282On youtube*
If people can monetize unboxing videos for GPUs I see no reason you couldn&#039;t monetize this.
&gt;make your videos 11-18 minutes long.&gt;keep them engaging&gt;high quality video &amp; audio&gt;tell people to like &amp; subscribe&gt;upload at least 1 video a weekIf you do these things you will succeed on youtube
&gt;&gt;2259310&gt;11-18 minutes10 minutes tops....and that&#039;s only if you have dedicated viewers
&gt;&gt;2259310Thank you for the advice. So like the guy said above for the unboxing videos, i shouldnt have any issues monetizing videos showing a cars make and model?
Did you ever have a coin shred you alive when you had to go to work for 8 hours and couldn&#039;t react because working?
/biz/, why don&#039;t you put your trust in Trustcoin(tm)?

Isn&#039;t there a platform where u can store everything at once? I&#039;m losing track of all my shit and need help bizhelp a coiner out
HELP ME OUT FAGGOTS
&gt;&gt;2258455Probably jaxx my man. It&#039;s a multi currency wallet but it doesn&#039;t do all of them. It&#039;s simpler though and i don&#039;t think storing all of them in bittrex is a good idea although that&#039;d probably work too.
&gt;&gt;2259255Give me some of them coins for helping yeah? :^)
how the fuck can I buy my first bitcoin?registered at coinbase, sent them a small amount of euro, been waiting for days now, nothing, my payment method isn&#039;t verifiedregistered at kraken, filled it up to tier 3, been waiting for days again, not processed/verified, cant buy anythingregistered on bittrex, there is no option to buy bitcoin with bank account, or I can&#039;t fucking find itregistered on poloniex, there is no option to buy bitcoin with real money againwhat the fuckI&#039;ve been trying to fucking get in for more than a week now and I cantwhywhy is this so fucking hardis this what the future is supposed to be?

&gt;&gt;2258718This is the type of question you should&#039;ve asked years ago. But you didn&#039;t listen.Go with localbitcoin. I can buy bitcoin in a matter of hours with a little markup there.
I will sell you 0.5-5 bitcoins depending on payment methodbittstoreuk@protonmail.com , I trade on local bitcoins and can verify this

&gt;&gt;2258791BUT THE TRAINSIM MISSING ALL THE TRAINS
&gt;&gt;2258690I am having the exact same problems!no coiner here and wanted to try and buy bitcoincoinbase let me buy a tiny bit of ETHthen it says my payment needs verifyingI ring bank and they say its nothing to do with themSo coinbase says my bank has to verfiy it. bank says nosome whale please donate so I can at least try it out :-(dont want much i am going to try out how it all worksand then want to buy and hold on a few things I think look promising

&gt;&gt;2258728This
&gt;&gt;2258888git gud
fuck this im not buying it with such a markup just cause exchanges cant go faster
&gt;&gt;2258918thank you
&gt;&gt;2258690Go to Virvox, deposit however much you want. Convert USD to SLL then covnert SLL to BTC. Afterwards you can send the BTC to whichever wallet you want (first transaction takes 48 hours)
&gt;&gt;2258996Whats the speed of buying a bitcoin compared to a litcoin?
&gt;&gt;2259117Don&#039;t buy altcoins as your first purchase. Buy a Bitcoin then exchange Bitcoins to Altcoins. Keep in mind Virvox has a 10% fee which is astronomical, but I&#039;ve tried like 6 different services and didn&#039;t get anywhere.
Crypto stupid question thread -- ask ANYTHING related to crypto, no matter how stupid you think it is. What is buy wall, how to buy bitcoin etc. (bully free zone)In addition, here&#039;s what you should know:1. Getting away from the hooked nose merchant bankersThe hooked nose bankers with last names ending with Berg, Gold and Stein, are shitting their pants. And for very good reasons: crypto-currency will crumble their business, seemingly overnight.The banks make their money from charging you up the ass with fees. They charge $30 for over draft fees, $10 a month for having an account with them. Everytime you give the jews money, they collectively orgasm in joy, while rubbing their hands together until it bleed.They also loan you money that they don&#039;t have (known as fractual reserve), so they can enrich themselves.It works like this: they loan you money they printed out of thin air... and they loan YOUR money that is the bank to other people without your permission!Note: when you hold money in your currency (whether it&#039;s USD, AUD or YEN) your wealth is slowly eroding through inflation -- at the rate of 2.5 percent a year (or higher). This means, in 1915 it cost a penny to buy a shoe, nowadays it cost $150 to buy a pair of sneakers.Banking is a jewish scam and it&#039;s time to get away from it.... It&#039;s time to tell them to fuck off and become your own bank! For example, you can lend your bitcoin for interest on Poloniex.com. You can transfer wealth across the world without a bank account -- all you need is a bitcoin address. In the near future, everyone will have most of their wealth in crypto currencies and Mr. Zuckerberg banker can&#039;t do anything about it.When Mr. Zuckerberg puts dips his hand into your pocket, you smack his fucking hooked nose.
&gt;&gt;2244319Please explain buy wall/sell wall.
Any more pics of the hot chick?
Few questions...What is the Best mobile app to buy all types of coins?What are key factors when looking into investing in the best coins.What are the best sites to do research on the coin companies?
Yeah more hot chick!
&gt;&gt;2244319Please explain how I get over the fear of the following:To win, I must buy low and sell high. So I look for something low. But I get the fear that the one I choose and is low, will remain low forever or go even lower or the coin will just fuckup completely like asiacoin.
&gt;&gt;2244360When there is a big sell wall, it means that at that price point a whale (someone with huge coins) sells it off, which means that the price of the coin goes down and won&#039;t break that price point.&gt;&gt;2244376&gt;Any more pics of the hot chick?Dunno&gt;What is the Best mobile app to buy all types of coins?Kraken.com is good. Go with Kraken.&gt;What are key factors when looking into investing in the best coins.Great development team, coin is actually useful for doing something. Therefore, you don&#039;t want to invest in shit coins. ETH and BTC is solid, so is XMR, STEEM.&gt;What are the best sites to do research on the coin companies?Marketcoincap.com, then you click on the coin name, then you can go to their official website. youtube &quot;what is &lt;coin name&gt;&quot; helps too. KEEP LEARNING.
What is blockchain? I dont understand the wikipedia definitionWhen a new &quot;coin&quot; come in (like BAT), are we buying an action of the company? like believing that the company&#039;s project will be succesful?
Explain what is the relation between price and volume?
&gt;&gt;2244402&gt;To win, I must buy low and sell high. So I look for something low. But I get the fear that the one I choose and is low, will remain low forever or go even lower or the coin will just fuckup completely like asiacoin.Don&#039;t invest in shit coins. Look at coins withGreat development team, coin is actually useful for doing something. You need to do massive research. Technical analysis helps, trading vol, and market cap helps too.Never panic sell, or else you&#039;re a weak white suburb kid.
&gt;&gt;2244431&gt;Never panic sell, or else you&#039;re a weak white suburb kid.What if I need an $80 dime bag?
&gt;&gt;2244418&gt;What is blockchain? I dont understand the wikipedia definitionThink of a blockchain as a book with records and it cannot be changed by anyone (including the fucking jews) ... that&#039;s what the block chain is. It&#039;s just a fancy way of computers keeping a book (ledger) that cannot be modified once a certain time pass.&gt;When a new &quot;coin&quot; come in (like BAT), are we buying an action of the company? like believing that the company&#039;s project will be succesful?Yes, exactly. ICO is basically like IPO. Think of a coin as a stock.
&gt;&gt;2244415&gt;Great development team, coin is actually useful for doing something.For this reason, and no mentioning of NEM, anyone should study why NEM is useful for banking sector.Also, read whitepaper and compare each and every tech/algo/scientific/algo stuff they put in, and judge it by their way of realizing it. Cuz research paper is just a... well, research.
&gt;&gt;2244419&gt;Explain what is the relation between price and volume?You want vol. because it means people are interested in the coin and it&#039;s trading. Generally speaking when there is high vol, the price goes up and down fast, so there is money to be made.
&gt;&gt;2244319How do you know if the coin has a great development team?
Oh this is exactly what i was looking for. I have come into contact with a significant amount of (temporary) money that I could invest.I was recently in an bad accident. the insurance sent 75k that I need to use to pay back the hospital. I am currently paying it back at a rate of 8.5k a month. I am thinking about investing a good bit of it into bitcoin so maybe i can double it and come out with good lump of change. I&#039;ve been researching this for the few days or so with alright results.First: is this a good idea?Second question: how much?Third: where can i invest in bulk with the lowest fee?Forth: when should I invest?(I&#039;m thinking in about 3 weeks or so)fifth: is flipping a good idea? I&#039;ve been doing practice flipping and I would have made around $3000 +- 5% - fees in around 24 hours.any and all help would be appreciated.
&gt;&gt;2244462Continuation to my question, I see the trading vol sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down. Why is it so? Are people getting out a lot when I see it going down? Also, how do coinmarketcap knows the trading volume goes down? Do they calculate it based on the coin supply vs the holdings of investor?
2. Understanding crypto-currencyYou have to understanding the underlying technology behind crypto-currency, which is mostly &quot;block chains&quot;.... Watch this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3OTJ1AdraYThe more you understand about crypto-currency, the impending ramifications this technology have on the world, the stronger your faith you willhave in crypto-currency. If you invest right, you can buy yourself a lambo wthin 2 years.Why is this technology important? For the first time in history, the money goes back to the people. As a famous Jew once said: &quot;I control the money, I control the country&quot;. (did you know the Federal Reserve is actually a private banking company? The government has to borrow money from a private company! Really makes you think ...)You&#039;re in the fucking golden age of crypto, because you got in early. Yes, we&#039;re in the very early phase. When clueless baby boomers and the local starbucks cunts on their macbooks are browsing crypto currency, you know crypto is mainstream. Right now it isn&#039;t -- far from it ...
How do I backup my ether/btc?
&gt;&gt;2244319What do you mean by &quot;coin is actually useful for doing something&quot; What can a digital coin do other than inspire trading?
&gt;&gt;2244451Thanks.And why this is good? It is like the codes that are in dollars that dont allow to falsify money?Everytime that there is more bitcoins (by mining?), that data stick to other blocks and convert those btc in real money?
&gt;&gt;2244319I want to start buying and selling coins. I understand that i need a &quot;wallet&quot;. what is the best wallet and what should i do next to start buying ETH or bitcoin?
&gt;&gt;2244486Sounds risky; only invest what you can afford. If you trade goes to shit, how you&#039;re going to pay the hospital? LOL.&gt;&gt;2244493&gt;Continuation to my question, I see the trading vol sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down. Why is it so?Because sometimes whales &quot;pump and dump&quot;, meaning a whale is a person with 1000 BTC, they buy the coins (to pump it), other people see that it&#039;s pumping so high so they buy it too, they the whale dumps all the coins thus crashing the price ... then people get awry of trading that coin so the trading vol. goes down. You want to trade coins that has a trading vol. of 1000 BTC or more so it can&#039;t be pumped and dumped by whales.&gt;Also, how do coinmarketcap knows the trading volume goes down? Do they calculate it based on the coin supply vs the holdings of investor?I believe coinmarketcap gets their data from exchanges like POLONIEX and BITTREX, so they can see the trading vol.
&gt;&gt;2244510There are two ways:1) Private keys - search for the backup function from your wallet and get its private key. It should look like a long garbage numbers and alphabet. Write it on a piece of paper and keep it safe and DON&quot;T let anyone see or use it, else your wallet is someone else&#039;s.2) Pass phrase - This is similar to Private Keys, only that it is in english words like &quot;hello laptop books dumb speaker...&quot;. BUT this phrase can only be generated within the wallet you are using AND restored using the same wallet. Unlike Private Keys which can be used to restore in any kind of wallet.Correct me if I&#039;m wrong. The way I backup mine is1) take a piece of paper2) get the private keys/pass phrase3) write it down each and every character - or you could just put it in Word and print it (I&#039;m paranoid of Microsoft botnet spying on me, it&#039;s why I jot it down)4) reconfirm it by using Diff Text tool online (it&#039;s safe no worries)5) also note down which wallet I&#039;m using atm, cuz I might wanna download and use the same wallet to restore it in the future if my laptop got stolen or anything6) keep the paper somewhere safe
&gt;&gt;2244510&gt;How do I backup my ether/btc?Buy a hardware wallet like nano ledger s. Youtube it.&gt;&gt;2244518&gt;What do you mean by &quot;coin is actually useful for doing something&quot; What can a digital coin do other than inspire trading?For example, ETH is about &quot;smart contracts&quot;, XMR is good for privacy, STEEM is about earing money from social media related stuff, XRP is tech for banks (but we know XRP is a kike scam), GNT is about distributed computing, BTC is a storage of value etc, DASH is normie friendly for spending crypto etc.When a coin does something unique, there is a future in it so it isn&#039;t a shit coin.
&gt;&gt;2244510If you&#039;re using myetherwallet, back up the json file. If you&#039;re using exodus, there&#039;s a back up button on the left. It depends on the service/program you&#039;re using.
&gt;&gt;2244360often whales (investors with large amounts of holdings) will place large buy/sell orders in order to affect the speculative price upwards or downwards. Sometimes these walls are real and when they are hit the price will swing in the opposite direction of the wall as the market is flooded with supply/supply is dried up. More often than not they are fake - when the price gets too close to the wall, the wall will vanish leaving the price to moon or crash in the direction of the wall.
I want to turn my 1 BTC into 10 BTCCan Bancor make it x10?Why would Bancor go up?
&gt;&gt;2244577&gt;&gt;2244510Also,Treat mobile app wallet (Coinomi, Xapo, Electrum, Jaxx etc) as your daily wallet you put in your pocket. DO NOT keep your stash of coins inside. This is called &quot;hot storage&quot;. Google the meaning.Put your stash in a cold storage, such as your wallet stored in your laptop which you can get its private key/pass phrase to backup.
&gt;&gt;2244534&gt;And why this is good? It is like the codes that are in dollars that dont allow to falsify money?Why is BTC worth $2.2k USD per coin? Because the people (market) agreed that that&#039;s the price. Also BTC is useful because you can cash out from BTC to fiat (your local currency).For example, Western Money Gram makes BILLIONS a year by sending money from one country to another, usually a Mexicans or Indians sending money home back to their family. Instead of paying money gram $30 to send $500 home, they can send BTC back home and it only cost $2 in mining fees.And yes, no flasifying money.&gt;Everytime that there is more bitcoins (by mining?), that data stick to other blocks and convert those btc in real money?Yes, because keeping the ledger cost electricity, and electricity cost money, the program rewards the miner (the computers that keep the book record) some bitcoins every 10 minutes or so.
okay, but just for fun could i get an answer on these ones? :)Third: where can i invest in bulk with the lowest fee?Forth: when should I invest?(I&#039;m thinking in about 3 weeks or so)fifth: is flipping a good idea? I&#039;ve been doing practice flipping and I would have made around $3000 +- 5% - fees in around 24 hours.
&gt;&gt;2244611&gt;I want to turn my 1 BTC into 10 BTC&gt;Can Bancor make it x10?&gt;Why would Bancor go up?Yes, buy and hold bancor. It looks solid as fuck if the technology delivers. Buy and hold for 2 years, be iron hand, no pussy hands allowed.
&gt;&gt;2244555smooth digits
What happens when a coin supply reached its maximum? Will there be any mining activities? How is the economy of the coin react to it?Can&#039;t think of any coin that has max&#039;d its supply. Do we have now?
also, can you think of anything that would make btc&#039;s (or other cryptocurrency) price crash?
&gt;&gt;2244672&gt;Third: where can i invest in bulk with the lowest fee?Karken.&gt;Forth: when should I invest?ETH and ETC.Those will only go up. Never panic sell at a lost.
&gt;&gt;2244682NewsBad news
&gt;&gt;2244680&gt;What happens when a coin supply reached its maximum? Will there be any mining activities?There will still be mining activities. For example, BTC will essentially reach max 21 million coins in 2024. To compenstate for mining fees, the sending BTC fee will be somewhat high, so the miners can get some money.Hint: 1 BTC will be at least $100k USD in 2024.&gt;Can&#039;t think of any coin that has max&#039;d its supply. Do we have now?Good question; I don&#039;t know. Someone please chime in.
are there any good/semi-reliable ways to predict a bubble?
&gt;&gt;2244682&gt;also, can you think of anything that would make btc&#039;s (or other cryptocurrency) price crash?Bad news but that doesn&#039;t matter because the price always bounce up, most of the time if it isn&#039;t a shit coin.People panic sell and lose money, the smart people buy the coins cheap, it goes back up and those with iron hands (smart people) get free money off the dumb people who panic sell.Never panic sell. Strong nigger hands only.
What wallet can you use to store eth, btc, and many other coins in one place? Can you add more coins to my ether wallet? Is my ether wallet considered cold storage? Can i trust my entire stash on there?
&gt;&gt;2244696What do you mean Bad News. Bad News of what? Trump is assasinated? Aliens Invade what kind of bad news?
&gt;&gt;2244715&gt;are there any good/semi-reliable ways to predict a bubble?Catch a coin when there is massive, MASSIVE trading vol when it&#039;s going upwards like a rocket and then crash out. Never buy when it&#039;s mooning and going sideways (side rally)
how much have you guys made on cryptocurrency? just curious
&gt;&gt;2244709&gt;Hint: 1 BTC will be at least $100k USD in 2024.I always see people saying this and referring to my question above about trading vol vs price, they are able to know how much a coin worth. How do you get the numbers though?
&gt;&gt;2244518if you go to coinmarketcap.com, you can click a coin then go to the coin&#039;s website and read about it
&gt;&gt;2244736See Mt Gox news circa 2013-2014
&gt;&gt;2244715&gt;are there any good/semi-reliable ways to predict a bubble?Also, you never know when a massive bubble is coming, you can only camp yourself BEFORE the bubble starts. This means having good fundamentals and how the coin tech will change the world instead of being a shit coin; look at STRAT it&#039;s useful as shit that&#039;s why the price is mooning.
oh here&#039;s a good question.what would stop a cryptocurrency from price capping? I mean it can&#039;t keep going up forever right?
&gt;&gt;2244749I get all my numbers straight from my Rabbi.
&gt;&gt;2244577&gt;BUT this phrase can only be generated within the wallet you are using AND restored using the same wallet. Unlike Private Keys which can be used to restore in any kind of wallet.Nope can be restored with any wallet that uses BIP-39 mnemonic seed recovery.
&gt;&gt;2244747I lost $500 in 2014 on Asiacoin blockchain fuckup or whatever it was.
&gt;&gt;2244786Thank you
&gt;&gt;2244758Yep I was trading through that shit. Escaped a big loss there but lost a a little. It was part of the reason I got out and am only back now.
do you think the use of quantum computers is going to change the btc mining game a little? the classical mining machines will become obsolete.
Your top 3 wallets for beginners, /biz/?
&gt;&gt;2244815Electum for BTCMyetherwallet for ethereum and friendsMost other coins just go with the one the devs recommend
&gt;&gt;2244811&gt;do you think the use of quantum computers is going to change the btc mining game a little? the classical mining machines will become obsolete.Yes but by then they&#039;ll have crypto-hash function that is quantum computer resistance.&gt;&gt;2244815&gt;Your top 3 wallets for beginners, /biz/?&gt;&gt;2244815&gt;Your top 3 wallets for beginners, /biz/?Kraken.com to get your cash to bitcoinnano ledger s to store your bitcoin long termbittrex.com to trade coins.
&gt;&gt;2244758So the only thing that can have significant determinental impact on the value of a coin is the viability of the institutions that provide a field for those coins to be traded. Holy SHit.
If i want to buy altcoins, how do I do it?Right now the only way I see is buy BTC on coinbase, send BTC to Bittrex, trade for altcoins.I want to put $300 into Stratis and $200 into Waves
&gt;&gt;2244843Yes. Or use Kraken because coinbase is jew.
&gt;&gt;2244843correct. coinbase only has ETH, BTC, and LTC, so if you buy there you have to send it elsewhere.
How do you buy into the Bancor ICO?
&gt;&gt;2244869what does ico mean
What is an ATH and was is (rnd number) sat?
&gt;&gt;2244882Initial coin offering, Bancor will probably be very very expensive (1eth=1bancor) according to the whitepaper, $150 a piece on an ICO i&#039;d avoidLots are scams now
&gt;&gt;2244894ATH is all time high
what are your predictions for btc at the end of 2017? ETH and ETC too
&gt;&gt;2244906their value proposition seems to address the current shitshow with exchanges, plus speculation at an all-time high means at least 3x pump
&gt;&gt;2244319where can i learn the basics? like everything from scratch. i don&#039;t even know what a wallet is.
&gt;&gt;2244961google it. The basics are explained everywhere meanwhile
&gt;&gt;2244824&gt;&gt;2244831Thanks, now how do I start mining ETH? What&#039;s the best mining software?
&gt;&gt;2244736Bad news like 2 planes just knocked down 3 towers. DOW just dropped 15,000 points type stuff.
&gt;&gt;2244894sat is satoshi, the smallest unit of measurement of a coin&#039;s value, which is 0.00000001 of a bitcoin.1 bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis.
&gt;&gt;2244984thx!
how can you be so sure btc is going to be 100k in 2024?
&gt;&gt;2244961I just watched videos on YouTube.A wallet is just like a bank account. You have one for each type of coin and it generates an address (which functions just like a bank account number). Just keep in mind the address changes with time to each time you want to send something to your wallet you have to get its current address.There are wallets that are online and in the exchange and then hardware wallets where you download it do your computer which is far more secure.I recommend electum for BTC as it&#039;s very secure and simple to use.
&gt;&gt;2244486okay back to this first question.if i could allocate 30k safely for 3 months, what are the odds that the price would be below the starting amount?
&gt;&gt;2245038as long as i didn&#039;t invest while it&#039;s mooning that is.
&gt;&gt;2245038Any answer you get would just be speculation. Consider buying these coins as gambling and only buy what you&#039;d be willing to lose.With that said the smallest risk would be BTC or ETH
&gt;&gt;2244319Good thread.How to make a wallet on PC?Or should I store it on a PC not on the internet?
Whats the best way to buy coins through cash?What coins should i buy
Is it worth my eyeball time to watch stuff like this?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhPmYTeQJ8
&gt;&gt;2244831What are wallets used for?Why do you call them wallets? Whats the point of them?
Lurking no-coiner hereIf i, a burger, were to put money into crypto, and make a profit, but not keep track of every single little trade, how does one cash out to USD AND not get fug&#039;d by the irs?
retard here.So I kind of get that bitcoin is limited by &#039;computing power&#039; and that gives the currency value. So what is the difference between bitcoin and other coins? How do they give THEIR coins value? Do they do the same thing?
Why are there so many different coins? Why does every company that uses block chain want or need to make their own cryptocurrency?How do I convert crypto to cash? It seems like not many people have turned crypto profits to cash money. when whales dump where are they dumping too. Are they cashing out? Wouldn&#039;t that mean they fill out 1099 each time?Many thanks for anyone who answers
Christ this shit is confusing.So I buy my monopoly money from one of these online exchangers, and they give me a wallet or &quot;account&quot; or whatever yes? But the one they give you you don&#039;t actually want because risk of hacks? So you use one of these wallet programs mentioned ITT to make another account and send the shit you bought to there?
&gt;&gt;2244319lets say i made 50 million on bitcoin or altcoins. what&#039;s the smartest way of converting my money to cash?
is it dangerous to do the verification process for gemini? it seems odd to me. a group of people who value privacy and anonymous online presence feel comfortable handing over every last bit of information on an online exchange.should i sign up for gemini and do the verification? how is it not dangerous for reasons like identify theft etc.
&gt;&gt;2244319&gt;no matter how stupid you think it ishow do i import my portfoli into blockfolio, i think i must be retarded
&gt;&gt;2246387The exchanges have their own set of wallets which hold the coins from all of their users accounts.Its possible for you to generate your own wallet and hold your own coins in the same manner. Exchanges just abstract it up a level so its quicker for everyone involved, but this also means the coins are centralized so its a big target for hackers.
&gt;&gt;2246536I see, thanks. So to get my stuff from the exchange to my own thing I just send it in the typical way, inputting the address of my generated wallet?
&gt;&gt;2244319I want to marry this girl.
&gt;&gt;2246534you do it trade by trade on the app there is no way to export it ( as far as I know)
&gt;&gt;2246467sell you coins slowly on an exchange that allows fiat transactions. This may result in the payment of taxes.you could also buy all BTC and sell them slowly in localbitcoins.com. this may result in jailtime
&gt;&gt;2244319Fuckable goddess. Just the way I like it
&gt;&gt;2246196there will be a way to see the history of every trade I almost gurantee it. if not how could the IRS find out you owe them ;)
&gt;&gt;2244486It&#039;s tricky but depending on your situation you could throw it all in a wallet and declare bankruptcy and youd keep all of it. You could also take a loan out in the meantime and have like 150k untraceable.
&gt;&gt;2244443With your gains you can buy pounds and pounds of weed
What could potentially doom cryptos?
&gt;&gt;2247031discovering a major flaw in elliptic curve cryptoquantum computers successfully btfoing public key cryptoa massive world scale war
&gt;&gt;2247062&gt;a massive world scale warfeel like this one would benefit not destroy
&gt;&gt;2244319I&#039;m looking to invest about 10k long term and hold. BTC seems like the safest option for this. Question is, do I buy in now or wait? I think it could drop to 1400 or so from what it is now, but worry with potential mass adoption going forward (Japan, India, etc) that right now the price is actually low. What do you anticipate, or is it too tough to tell right now?
&gt;&gt;2247075I second that. Everyone will pick 4-5 cointype, sell everything else and go hardware wallet.Hoping that when the war ends their shit will be infinitely much more valuable.
&gt;&gt;2244319What do people use to buy coins? I registered on coinbase, but they only seem to sell three kinds of coinsHow does Blockfolio work? Do you have to link it to some account somewhere? Do you add money to it and buy through it?What&#039;s the current thought on Etherium? I considered buying in but people seem to think it will drop? Looked at Litecoin too, but it looked like some meme forced by coinbase so I feel like I should stay away
&gt;&gt;2244319How do you cash ou
&gt;&gt;2244319This whole thing of if you lose your bitcoins they are gone forever. How can that work properly if bitcoin became a thing that is used in everday banking with everyday people?Banks offer to protect your money from mistakes, or theft.Yes I know fiat is bad, but this whole &quot;poof&quot; its gone and you can&#039;t get it back thing just seems so risky .... will there ever be a way for people to never lose their bitcoins? Or to get them back if lost?
With 1st August coming and a possible soft fork, how will that impact bitcoin, and what problems may arise from this for users
&gt;&gt;2244495The Federal Reserve is privately owned by the banks in America. When it built a building in NYC and was subjected to millions of dollars in tax, they began stating that they&#039;re a government entity and should be exempted from taxation. So what are they exactly? GG USA. GG WORLD.
&gt;&gt;2244451&gt;Yes, exactly. ICO is basically like IPO. Think of a coin as a stock.no, fuck no... this is blatant bullshit...An IPO is when a company goes public and offers shares to buy. This is called equity. You actually own part of a real company. A company that has revenue, earnings, etc, etc,ICO are not equity in a company, but simply buying bits and bytes of a complex algorithm, or coins. You don&#039;t own part of a company. There are no revenues, earnings, etc, etc. There is only speculation of what the coin is worth.
&gt;&gt;2244319What are the risks of making a fortune then not being able to cash out via coinbase/bank acct?I want to cash out legally, pay taxes etc..(US) but will the bank freeze my acct if I make mad gains like 100k or even millions?
&gt;&gt;2244319How do I buy into an ICO? I want to get bancor with some eth when it comes out, how do I do this?
Shamelessly axing againWhy are there so many different coins? Why does every company that uses block chain want or need to make their own cryptocurrency?How do I convert crypto to cash? It seems like not many people have turned crypto profits to cash money. when whales dump where are they dumping too. Are they cashing out? Wouldn&#039;t that mean they fill out 1099 each time?Many thanks for anyone who answers
&gt;&gt;2244319&gt;feesYeah! Those crypto fees are totally different! Paid only $8 to transfer a few $100 worth of BTC to my wallet.ETH ain&#039;t better lol.
&gt;&gt;2244431Don&#039;t listen to him. All coins are shitcoins. It&#039;s a fucking gamble driven by sentiment. Fundamentals are worth shit (because they&#039;re not real fundamentals). TA is superstition.The only thing you can do is proper bankroll management. Yes, crypto market is more like poker than a real financial market.
&gt;&gt;2244555I mined ETH, so I used myetherwallet.comOtherwise, I would recommend electrum if you want an offline wallet for btc. To buy btc or eth on an exchange, you need to sign up for an exchange (kraken is good), get confirmed and then transfer funds. Otherwise, go to localbitcoins.com and buy some btc buy getting an account and setting up a transaction with a seller. This was pretty much a google away, though
&gt;&gt;2244319I been looking into NEM, is NEM a better technology than Ripple?
&gt;&gt;2244319why isn&#039;t litecoin more respected?
&gt;&gt;2244976Claymore if you want to just mine ETH, just literally set it up as is shown on a pool like nanopool.org.Otherwise nicehash
&gt;&gt;2247339It feels like nothing special. It&#039;s like bitcoin&#039;s little brother.

&gt;&gt;2247292The fees are literally the best they could be. The only way to keep the network running is to have fees at least compensate for electricity of the network, thus the fee for a transfer is fairly accurately priced. Still, btc fees are more ridiculous than ETH due to the colossal confirmation time

&gt;&gt;2244593what does the verb &quot;to moon&quot; mean in this sense? to go way up in a sharp curve? to go way down?
&gt;&gt;2244582What is your expert opinion on Litecoin? Is it a dud? Will it go way up like ETH did in the past 3 months?
&gt;&gt;2244564&gt;You want to trade coins that has a trading vol. of 1000 BTC or more so it can&#039;t be pumped and dumped by whales.What does trading volume mean exactly? My apologies if this has already been answered.

&gt;&gt;2247270Shamelessly bumping my own question to keep it from being forgotten in the middle of the thread
Can I still become rich from investing in cryptocurrencies?How much should I start with?
bump thank you for all the info guys. what news sources/podcasts are reliable and informative?
&gt;&gt;2247571start with as much as you can and spread on not yet super pumped coins. dont margin trade. dont sell in loss. wait and wait till you got them monies. repeat or pull out.
&gt;&gt;2247665I&#039;d check out the Daily Shoah for BTC and Mysterium Fasces for ETH and related altcoins.
&gt;&gt;2244319How do i margin trade? like do i get to choose if price goes up or down? cuz if it means i get to hold more coins than i have do i have to sell the tops and buy the dips to make money on it? i just want the big bucks anon
How the fuck do people get in early to these huge surges that happen for literally no reason?Have most my money on Eth and today I literally could have traded it all for pretty much 80/100 of the top Coin market cap list and made between 10-40% fucking percent profit.What the fuck?!?!
&gt;&gt;2247731nah bro. we need a guiding light in the sea of degeneracy. tune in june 3rd for the return of the show that changed your weekend forever.

&gt;&gt;2244319How does Blockfolio work? Do you link your bank account to it
&gt;&gt;2244319How does Blockfolio work do you link it to your bank account? Is it a safe way to buy coin
&gt;&gt;2247922Its not an exhange, its just a way to view your entire portfolio. You have to manually enter your transactions
&gt;&gt;2244319What does &#039;&#039;sat&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;sats&#039;&#039; mean?
Ok here&#039;s a dumb one- why don&#039;t a large percentage of holders of an alt-coin collude to sell part of their coins for a reduced price to expand the userbase of a coin while holding some for profits that come with more users of the cryptocurrency? Wouldn&#039;t making cryptos affordable to a more massive population be beneficial to the currencies value in the long run?
Dear Anon,I have a few hundred dollars in several altcoins, around 15 different ones. All of them are at Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken.I want to transfer them to offline wallets for obvious reasons.Do I need to install each coin&#039;s wallet and save the coins into a file, repeat that for 10-15 coins, or is there a better solution ?How realistic is it that Poloniex, Kraken or Coinbase are ruining my coins at some point, if I store them in their wallet?
Hi all,Just got our of the meeting, hope you all enjoyed your XBY and DGB profits today.We have set XRP to moon tomorrow. Buy now.Have a good one,Anon

&gt;&gt;2258488Holy crap. He wasn&#039;t lying.
&gt;&gt;2258768i have 70%, i shouldve gone 100
&gt;&gt;2258488It begins
&gt;&gt;2258488naw
&gt;&gt;2258952Absolutely this.
I never see anyone on here talk about margin trading on Polo. Do you guys recommend it? I&#039;ve been margin trading ETH and STR and making really comfy gains with the 2.5X leverage. Loan rates are like .15% daily so it&#039;s basically free money so long as your investments go up.
Don&#039;t margin trade on full leverageDon&#039;t shortDon&#039;t borrow at .15% you can easily get loans between .08 and. 1You&#039;re at the mercy of whales at all timesYes you can make good money in a short timeYou can get caught with your collateral tied up at the wrong time. I just got caught in a long during black Friday. Took a decent whack
&gt;&gt;2258324well, bitcoin is about to do something again, inb4 the second coming of black friday
&gt;&gt;2258324Yeah I try to stick to 2X leverage. I buy in right whenever a big dip peters out and can almost always make 3% which is more like 6% with leverage. It&#039;s small but comfortable gains and never leave my position open longer than a couple hours. Why are only some coins allowed to be traded on margin? I could&#039;ve made so much damn money on DGB if that was available to margin trade.
&gt;&gt;2258324Also is there anyway to set a sell order with a margin trade or do you have to manually close them?
Could anyone give me a quick explanation on this?How does it work?
&gt;&gt;2258324&gt;Don&#039;t shortI like shorting Ripple desu
&gt;&gt;2258371me too am retrrd
&gt;&gt;2258371&gt;&gt;2258381You put your BTC in a margin account. This allows you to take out a loan with your BTC as collateral. The loan is typically around .1% a day. This allows you to buy 2.5x what you actually have with someone else&#039;s BTC. So you make 2.5x profits or 2.5x losses. I think there&#039;s some good youtube videos explaining it better but I just kind of figured it out on my own.
&gt;&gt;2258424Thanks. I might try this after some of my shit is untied.
How much is enough to get started trading on margin? I made a lot from just buying eth early but I dont want to wipe my balance by being a dumbass on margin.Is 500USD in a new polo account a good start?
&gt;&gt;2258490Yeah but I would expect to get rich off this really quick. If you started on the bottom of a day like black friday youd be rich though. You have to buy the absolute bottom of dumps to make guaranteed money. And good God never short in a market like this. Not even once.
&gt;&gt;2258424What account? Where do you sign up for the loan?
&gt;&gt;2258539Click the margin tab. You can transfer balances from the Exchange to Margin accounts in a second. Whenever you place your buy order you also set the loan rate at which you want to get a loan. set it to .1% to pretty much guarantee that you&#039;ll get a loan.
&gt;&gt;2258584The loans are limit right? If I left the default 2% loan I would get a lower loan if available.Correct?
&gt;&gt;2258206How do I loan bitcoins on exchanges? Anything aside from poloniex?I only see a few coins at a given time on Poloniex like Monero and Eth, but nothing low-volume.And do I lose just 20% or do I lose 60% depending how much I loaned?Also I can never loan more than 3x my current BTC.
&gt;&gt;2258366Just margin sell at the price you want. It will be listed as an open order&gt;&gt;2258330That&#039;s what i thought so i went full fiat and missed the ETH pump. Cost me 16k
&gt;&gt;2258621You&#039;ll get cucked. Always set the loan limit to under at least .12%The lower your set it, the slower it is to fill though so you need to find a sweet spot.
&gt;&gt;2258845Aye, thanks
I&#039;m an ausfag so it&#039;s late but maybe tomorrow I&#039;ll write up a guide with some info you don&#039;t get told that isn&#039;t in the FAQLike how polo will happily fuck you on loan rates
&gt;&gt;2258860You should mate. Would be a great help
&gt;&gt;2258821So it will close my long then?
&gt;&gt;2258879help pls
&gt;&gt;2259124if you want to stop your margin order you use a stop-limit order
&gt;&gt;2258206The average poster on here should staythefuckawayfrom margin trading.
Is there some quick way to transfer my trade histories to Blockfolio like importing csv files? If I have to type every transaction by itself I really see no point in using this app
&gt;&gt;2257973No quick way, all manual..not suited for day trading, rather long term hold
When I enter a sell for ETH/BTC, do I need to enter a buy on my BTC fan? It just shows profit, but total balance is off. Thank you.
i just type in my total amount, i dont care about every single transaction i made
&gt;&gt;2258022Is there a way to simply change the total amount? I&#039;ve been deleting the coin then re-entering it will the new total
&gt;&gt;2258009Yes you do. I sent them that feedback, like if I sell 1000 of coin X at 1000 sats and pay a 3% fee, it should add 970,000 sats to my BTC balance.Right now it doesn&#039;t. I&#039;m hoping this is something they fix. Fuck, even Google finance does this for you.
&gt;&gt;2258458Thank you.
&gt;&gt;2258072Go to the holdings tab for the coin and edit your amount
&gt;&gt;2257973No, because the dev is a faggot. I&#039;m working on an app that will do all of this and more by connecting to exchange api&#039;s and BTFO blockfolio. It won&#039;t be free though goy.
&gt;&gt;2257973I was in the same situation. Use Coinigy. They let you link all your accounts/wallets through API keys and even let you trade through the platform (if you enable/allow it for the respective API key(s) in the exchange/wallet settings). They also have a mobile app that works pretty well. It&#039;s on a monthly/bi-anual/anual subscription-basis, but the small fee is a joke for the functionality it provides.I still use Blockfolio to quickly check prices and set alerts (although Coinigy let&#039;s you set alerts as well, and with many more options like air horn sounds when open in your browser, email and text msg to your phone etc., still have to look into that). Just without entering any trades/amounts.
&gt;&gt;2258686I&#039;d pay money for that. Post up when you are done developing faggot
&gt;&gt;2258686Idc if it&#039;s pay for as long as it&#039;s under $5

It&#039;s ETC time to shinescreencap this
&gt;&gt;2257299ETH is a scam. Heard it first here on 4chan.
&gt;&gt;2257316how so, anon?
&gt;&gt;2257321because he just said it wasdont you believe your fellow 4channers?remember only bitcoin and ripple matters, rest is scam coins
$UBQ
&gt;&gt;2257321Because the whales have it on a short leash, and are literally the only factor deciding it&#039;s price.
&gt;&gt;2257399You just described all the cryptocoins
