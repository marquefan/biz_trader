I hope you buy the dip
&gt;&gt;2281338cant buy the dip coz all in already for 3 weeks :)
&gt;&gt;2281370thisI like to hold and watch my profits while I do useless shit.
This is literally the next ethereum
In today on Waves, BAT and Augur (REP).
&gt;&gt;2281588you are shilling this shitcoin in every single thread
I&#039;M IN, DID I MAKE IT!!!
&gt;&gt;2282002You made it anon, HODL for a year and you&#039;ll be rich. I expect we&#039;ll be looking at a few billion market cap by this time next year.
&gt;&gt;2282475If it reaches $76 that would make me a millionaire :) pretty cool idea. Hope it&#039;s gonna work, gotta stay realistic though
&gt;&gt;2282800Damn son, it needs to get close to $800 for me
Just bought it for 110 euros. Shits better be hot waves
This is a great coin. This and strat are the backbones of my portfolio
Selling all my Waves!!!It is confirmed Waves is a scam.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1sPozgmpA
I might be crazy but looking at the chart for waves, I think it might dip a bit lower.
&gt;&gt;2283351i dont wanna watch it all, whats it all about?
&gt;&gt;2283351??
&gt;&gt;2283351Wait Sasha isn&#039;t the coder?The fuck who codes waves then?He&#039;s like &quot;I&#039;m not a coder, I&#039;m a business man&quot; then he talks gibberish about being involved with using Java and neural networks.Holy shit I&#039;m fucking out.
&gt;&gt;2283365Not crazy though...I thought the same. Scary shit.I really hope it doesn&#039;t break through the 1800 level...there is no close resistance level after that.
&gt;&gt;2283351Why the fuck is the fat guy not wearing a shit. Also this video is like 9 months old...so yeahhhhhhh
&gt;&gt;22834589 months old
&gt;&gt;2283351I remember when this video was being cited as the reason why waves will never make it. Now waves is top 10 on cmc and it&#039;s not even on polo
When waves hits polo, its game over for nocoiners.
&gt;&gt;2283762yeah but when?
Was gonna buy some more after I get access to some more BTC this coming week but it just kept going up over the weekend. Should I jew out and hope it drops to 180k before buying again?
&gt;&gt;2283841There&#039;s a 80btc buy support at 190k on Waves DEX, it will never drop past 190k anytime soon
&gt;&gt;2283841Buy now. It&#039;s at $4.91. I&#039;ve been keeping my eye on it all week and it doesn&#039;t dip lower than this. Now is a good time to buy.
&gt;&gt;2283959yes
&gt;&gt;2283351Lol this stupid video. The interviewers are nocoiners who are just saying, &quot;isn&#039;t this a copy of Bitcoin, why do we need other coins?&quot; They have no idea waves has tech different than Bitcoin. They have no clue that the top 10 coins are all different coin based technologies. So stupid.
How do I buy it? I have Bitcoin and a waves wallet, can I just use shapeshift? Also does anyone have a decent graph website that has waves? Like cryptowat.ch
&gt;&gt;2284305there is a bitcoin address on your waves wallet that you can send btc to.then you can just buy directly through the DEX, no need to use intermediary exchanges if you just want the btc/waves pairing.
&gt;&gt;2284352Can&#039;t find it in my Android app. There&#039;s only a waves adress
&gt;&gt;2284742You need the light wallet chrome extension
&gt;&gt;2284811Waves light app?
20k sat increase4 hoursLeaving orbit nowSee you at the next dip nocoiners
&gt;&gt;2284828waves light client yeah
&gt;&gt;2285153I got it but now I can&#039;t buy waves in the client. It keeps giving me an error window saying Error! Order has not been created

&gt;&gt;2285173mods haven&#039;t abandoned this board sadly. I wish they could leave this board the fuck alone though.
&gt;&gt;2285173Just what I was thinking...
&gt;&gt;2285173Nothing wrong with some BLACKED porn on a SFW board, friend.
Tell me why this isn&#039;t a pump and dump
&gt;&gt;2283678It is, read the bitcointalk stuff and tell me it isn&#039;t
A coin formerly called dogecoin dark isn&#039;t a serious contender for anonymity against monero or zcash? Say it ain&#039;t so!
&gt;&gt;2283684They&#039;re saying when it comes to poloniex and when the smart contracts get implemented it will rise. However it sounds like hype talk to get you to buy. However, many coins are starting to rise. Maybe there&#039;s a new paradigm in the crypto world emerging, more options for different uses in a market that is exploding exponentially.
bamp
just dumped all my xvg thx op
&gt;&gt;2283903I plan on HODLING because I bought a few that I can afford to lose.
&gt;&gt;2283678Every single fucking coin&#039;s chart looks like that on that timescale.Cope harder faggot
&gt;&gt;2284006lol no, no coins rise 110% on a day
they are going to release their whitepaperhttps://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/871232404668764160
&gt;&gt;2284098What does that mean? How can a whitepaper legitimize them?
&gt;&gt;2284098no matter if it&#039;s mediocre or not, will xvg be expected to rise?
&gt;&gt;2284291thats why people are buying now, before the rest does tomorrow when they see the whitepaperso yes
&gt;&gt;2284318but i mean if the whitepaper is nothing special, will it still rise once it&#039;s released?bought in @ 57sat 2 nights ago, basically trippled my investment. How much higher could it possibly climb?
&gt;&gt;2284342To ~400. This shit&#039;s gonna be like DGB
&gt;&gt;2284010DGB literally did this two days ago.
&quot;shitcoin stay away! the dev is pumping it with rickstoner and other fucked up people from litecoin. they are a clique.You have been warned.&quot;Read this comment from somewhere regarding XVG. Anybody know if this is real?
XVG next DGB this week!
&gt;&gt;2284575legit
&gt;&gt;2284723Where can I find info on this?
&gt;&gt;2284010more like almost all coins rise 110% in a day
&gt;&gt;2284723Yes guys, this is legit because I said so!boooooy get that FUD (FUCKED UP DUMB SHIT) out my face
&gt;&gt;2284342People want the coin to grow, so it grows. This market is fucked up. And when the normies come flooding in, they will buy all the shitcoins.When that happens, think about when to sell. Shit will collaps. Bitcoin will rise, along with Eth, Ripple (normies will love Ripple) and a few others.
Tell me I didn&#039;t fuck up buying in at 164sats
&gt;&gt;2284887You didnt, Just relax, hold it.

&gt;&gt;2285151&gt;It&#039;s simple.&gt;XVG is the most private coin there is.Can you actually expound on how it achieves this? Or at least link to an article that explains it? What makes it so much more secure??

I just want to know my jew name
Here for my jew name
I am invested in this product both financially and opinion. I have bias to this upcoming statement. My shares will gain equity if you take this advice. That could be considered an ulterior motive of this post.Now that we&#039;ve got that out of the way, I&#039;d like to give you all a heads up on what I think has major potential as a platform and investment.BAT (Basic Attention Token)My theory is that in 4 hours until we see the more major upticks as the 24hr volume will be reset after the initial offering on Bittrex (which is currently skewed). Beyond that, this could scale exponentially and an excellent LONG for those who have been waiting for that opportunity.Here&#039;s a couple reasons why I have this opinion:1.) The Idea and Vision: not going to explain what it is in depth but it&#039;s an amazing concept that rewards those with tokens who elect to be exposed to online advertising. Great concept.2.) The Demand: ICO lasted 35 seconds, generating 35 million dollars. More evidence aside is the current trend.3.) The Execution: The vision isn&#039;t worth shit until the leadership behind it makes it a reality. The real seller here is the leadership. Brendan Eich, former Mozilla CEO, brings years of knowledge and deep ties to the Silicon Valley, which is just now starting BTC adoption through VC funding. This alone provides confidence.The main point to be made here, is that when you&#039;re investing, you should invest on the end-product potential, not the speculative waves or artificial stimulation. That&#039;s why you always want to hodl as you should believe the products long term potential. Warren said it best, &quot;Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.&quot;
It&#039;s going to go big but the ico was handled so badly that I don&#039;t want to give them my money.
&gt;&gt;2285069Do you really care about how the ICO was handled?I bought the second it hit Bittrex because I want fuckin $$$
&gt;it&#039;s an amazing concept that rewards those with tokens who elect to be exposed to online advertising. Great concept.this is not at all what they&#039;re doing, you&#039;re an idiot and should kill yourself
&gt;&gt;2285060What about 70% of the total coins in circulation being owned by just a few people? That worries me the most. I just don&#039;t trust something like that.
Here we post coins that we can go long on. Must be coin with competent team, real world application, good chance for success etc.Sia and Storj for blockchain storageStrat for mainstream language ETHAugur for market predictionsGolem for crowdsource computingThese are all high market cap.

Hey fellahs, today I was talking to my girlfriends $$$ dad and his friends about investments etc and I showed him my blockfolio and the crazy returns. He said in one of his business dealings recently he was offered 1.5 million dollars worth of bitcoin because the owners didn&#039;t know how to sell it and he refused because he doesn&#039;t understand it. He said he&#039;d try and get it back and if I could figure out how to sell it he&#039;d give me ten percent of the sales + give my girlfriend ten percent. I of course said hell yeah. That&#039;s crazy money for me.. 150,000 dollars.. I can&#039;t even comprehend.Anyway, how should I go about this sale assuming he gives me access to a wallet with 400+ btc? I live in New Zealand btw. I feel incredibly out of my depth right now. Current strategy was to deposit the btc into either coinbase or poloniex and then to sell them and withdraw like 2k a day cause I&#039;m still not verified. That&#039;s a 750 day strategy though.. Please helpPic unrelated cause I&#039;m on mobile
&gt;&gt;2280680send me some coins and we&#039;ll talk about it.I also live in nz, can gaurantee 200% + return every quarter cunt
I&#039;m eager to help, Bro. Send some here:144EwPbtyNDivvrKEd4muvZhuGP9NjUPZw
Contact exchanges and sell directly
Send me 0.01 btc and i&#039;ll happy whole day, and i wish you some luck, and then u probably take this money, dimwit shit eater.
&gt;&gt;2280680I can withdraw as much as 200k a month on Kraken.Let&#039;s say you do that yourself plus your girlfriend, you can cahs out 400k every month.You let the rest create some profit with a trading bot or by buying shitcoins. You get to keep the change you made by daily trading.in 3 months you have cashed out the whole 1.2mil your girlfriend&#039;s dad wanted and you get to have the rest on your kraken/bittrex account for you to play with and got some decent return
&gt;&gt;2280703Send my dick to you mouth. Check it pls
&gt;&gt;2280704This. Contact your BTC / NZD trader of choice and let them know you want to sell $1.5m of BTC. It might take them a couple of weeks to get ready but they should offer lower fees because they are making a fuckload either way.
&gt;&gt;2280680THis&gt;&gt;2280704Also, keep in mind you will need to factor capital gains taxes if/when you cash out.
&gt;&gt;2280704Do this.
if I were you I would be contacting exchanges and trying to conduct my own private deal with them, 50k limits a week aren&#039;t going to cut it, and you could do better on the fees considering your volume. you are thinking in nigger terms right now, 2k a day? for fuck sake anon it&#039;s 1.5 mil.
&gt;&gt;2280726&#039;of choice&#039; is my problem, who would be the most reliable/cost efficient trader do you think? I have experience with small quantities but nothing major. I just do not want to screw this up. Can&#039;t be any worse than they&#039;ve done so far though, 1.5 mil worth and the guy who owned it was calling up &#039;hotels and whatnot&#039; trying to sell it!!! Hotels!!! Why?? How did these old businessmen even get the btc in the first place?? And no one along this ridiculous chain of events, probably the bitcoins were being offered for pennies on the dollar.. I&#039;m in disbelief that the chain of ignorance has fallen at my feet. But yeah I&#039;m thinking about capital gains as well. Thanks so much for your help!!!
&gt;&gt;2280680use kraken dark pool ( I want 0.1% for this ahah) fast and cheap, you can&#039;t access it without &lt;50BTC orders
&gt;&gt;2280781I would use Coinjar but I&#039;m an Aussie, I don&#039;t know if they do NZD.To be extra safe you could negotiate with then to do 15 transactions of 100k.
Like other anons have mentioned, contact several exchanges. If done through several you can double or triple your withdraw speed.But I&#039;d worry about that guy who didn&#039;t know how to withdraw. It could be he&#039;s a dumb fuck, or he&#039;s asking OP to launder money for him and be a patsy. 150k doesn&#039;t com without risk, and if it&#039;s not inappropriate, I&#039;d inquire to how the seller acquired his BTC. At the very least asking the question will give you plausible dependability should the FBI come knocking at your door.
&gt;&gt;2280851These folks are rich old businessmen who are simply technogically inept. Fortunes made in the dairy industry. I can&#039;t imagine any wrongdoing at all. Thanks for your concerns tho
you sound way out of your depth op. her dad is offering you the money on the assumption that you know wtf youre doing, and you clearly dont. you&#039;re going to fuck this up.
&gt;&gt;2280921lowkey this
&gt;&gt;2280781Contact coinbase and poloniex if you are in the US.
&gt;&gt;2280680Open an account on Coinbase and get verified. Not too hard. Gemini and Kraken are also very good, Kraken has been here for a while and are super reliable. Then sell slowly at market price in the exchange and withdraw afterwards. If not, directly contact kraken exchange and they&#039;ll get back to you
&gt;&gt;2280921I am out of my depth, I don&#039;t deny this. Her dad and his family friends love me though, I&#039;m a bit of fresh air from their usual company. So he&#039;s throwing me a bone because I said I had 2k of my own money in cryptos, and gave them a rundown on ho cryptos work and showed them a few charts. The coins are doing nothing sitting around (except gaining value..). He&#039;d probably give me a 450 coin wallet and just forget about it, if he gets some money sweet of not then hey they were worthless to him anyway. So I&#039;m not gonna turn down a potential 300k for me and my girlfriend because I feel a bit out of depth. He literally asked how much 1.5 million dollars worth of bitcoin was worth. After a few clarifications as to what he was asking me, the answer he was seeking was 1.5 million dollars.. This is 100% funny money to him
&gt;&gt;2280680Everyone who sends genuine help post your wallets as well and if this actually pans out I&#039;ll give you like 0.01 coins or so :))
OP, give all your money to this guy:&gt;&gt;2280696
&gt;&gt;22810031PjChy3TudPCmx2cpfwWdirYJFoWHzt7iGJust give Coinbase a phone call.
Kraken or Bitstamp with full verification.It&#039;s really not hard.Unbelievable that people expect tips for such simple answers.
&gt;&gt;2280680I would just use CoinBase and eat the fees because it&#039;s all found money and the fees may be tax deductible.Then I would hire Flight of the Conchords to play my next barbecue, because why not do something random and interesting with your free money?&gt; Hey Jemaine. Loved you in Legion.&gt; Hey Anon. Thanks. I don&#039;t resent Brett&#039;s nearly EGOTing in a single year at all.&gt; Cool.&gt; Anyway here&#039;s Sugar Lumps.

&gt;&gt;2281022anon, congrats on the new fortune, and follow the advice of&gt;&gt;2280974&gt;&gt;2280746even if you could withdraw 5k/day it would take months, going through the exchange directly is your only hope. It may be hard to find an actual customer support number however. You could also try contacting a moderator in the trollbox on poloniex.plz donate to poor economics student senpai1BnR9RsMeS3XeF6CbBJhALtYnauj828zrY
&gt;&gt;2282374&gt;follow the advice&gt;&gt;2280974&gt;poloniexPoloniex does not deal with fiat currency.

&gt;&gt;2282853I&#039;d recommend contacting either Poloniex or Kraken directly to handle that large of a transaction.
You can always create multiple accounts or possibly cash out through localbitcoins.You&#039;re welcome3AaeQs9iSjTnLZkkY73H4tvBZokwLhXSkx
&gt;&gt;2280680with the time and effort it will take you?I can handle the entire exchange from BTC to account to cash. I Just ask 2.5 % for my fee.1GMQLwDWMCwJouuQ2TxVta3VC6asDM6AQ6

&gt;&gt;2280904James Leprino?
I&#039;d go with coinbase and try and nag them until they offer you a chance to sell them at a lower fee/one transactionOtherwise you have to step withdrawls, but could roll in other exchanges depending on your risk toleranceEven with higher withdrawl limits (25k/week) you&#039;re still looking at about a year - they&#039;d probably open your limits up once they saw a consistent pattern. At the least that would be a way to get their attention.
You&#039;re going to embarrass yourself and your daddy, kid.2k a day?! Is this a joke?Contact a broker, jesus christ.
&gt;contact coinbase or X directlyYou all act like cashing out $1,000,000 is something extraordinary.
have you considered gemini auctions? they seem ideal for handling large transactions like this.
&gt;&gt;2283383They won&#039;t even make 1 million in ten years of hard labor. They&#039;re sixteen.
&gt;&gt;22810221KFSn3kvbg7mbBGkWcTefTEkEdEDryb9BhThank you senpai.If I were you, I&#039;d just arbitrage all around, develop or buy a bot and start making serious gains then just sell off a part of the profit.Or, with 400 btc, you can do poloniex lending for completely safe profits, which is something I&#039;m planning to do once I get rich enough.
&gt;&gt;2281022also, use coinbase to sell btc to fiat currency.
&gt;&gt;2283475&gt;buy a botWhy would anyone sell money-making machines?
&gt;&gt;2281003450 coins isn&#039;t 1.5MM, i own more than that and i&#039;m not close to that. what kind of funny money are we talking about?a 500 coin sell isn&#039;t a big deal these days but youre still better off finding an exchange or company that does OTC trades or you&#039;ll spend too long trying to liquidate them because of limits or get raped for high fees.
&gt;&gt;2283497Because they can program them.Because they are poorPeople give away BTC like its candy.
Lend out some of the BTC on poloniex! You will make good mony with that amount of bitcoin.i beg u1PLW2fq1xc8wtmPJR4wYAWJjz8vzJb6KAi

Im gonna bump this from page 10 because I think this type of stuff is actually interesting to think about.
What are your thoughts on ZrCoin? I recently invested because it&#039;s a pretty cool idea. You can still buy into their ICO and you will receive a 50% bonus.
I put an ETC in for 10 coins, compared to nearly anything else(even fucking DGB or BitBean) it&#039;s literally designed for less potential profit. As I looked in deeper I regretted it more, basically a russian company trying to comply with ridiculous russian investment laws by crowdsourcing investors via crypto. It&#039;s like buying a stock, I&#039;ve seen other coins that play this game where if the company does good the coin will gain money(Etheroll, Lykke), which in my mind is a death sentence for the money. The advantage for crypto is that it&#039;s extremely fast, extremely new, and extremely hyped. You don&#039;t want to be in a failing investment, and with this they offer &#039;buyback&#039; at a specific time for a set reward. Which means you&#039;re relying on them for that growth. They even &#039;promise&#039; 100% growth, which is stinky enough as is despite the claims of their product.With crypto you can sell out on an exchange in a minute. With Zrcoin, you have a number after you login that tells you one a month you can back out of their dumb plan.You&#039;re trading all the advantages and liquidity of crypto for the disadvantages of regular investing and betting on an entirely different market than no one here knows enough about to be making a sane investment in the first place.I wish I realized this before I put my money in, now I&#039;ve got to wait for whenever the buyback starts to get my money out at a proposed 5% reward. It&#039;s bullshit of the highest order, I think you would be better off in nearly any crypto at this point instead of betting on a company with your crypto.At best, you make a 100% return and meanwhile the company has your cryptos which may have rocketed up 16000% because the entire market in climbing incessantly due to asians.I regret investing, and I suggest anyone thinking of putting anything into ZR to just stick it in BTC because there&#039;s at least the potential that you&#039;ll get a better return.
&gt;&gt;2284265Exactly what I thought
&gt;&gt;2284265Wow, a good/no shill post on /biz/god bless you
&gt;&gt;2284265thanks for real advice
Do you know why I have faith in blockchain and btc/altcoin market and am willing to throw my lifesavings into it?Because it&#039;s a nerdy white guy thing.
currency manipulation is a huge global issuecrypto is the most important new technology since the internet itself and hardly anyone even sees it yet.
&gt;&gt;2285111&gt;most important technologyI think you forgot about AI good sir.
&gt;&gt;2285099Always bet on nerds.If you had followed this advice during dot-com years, or tech stocks, or even back in the day with Nikola Tesla, you would become a very wealthy man.Ignore normies, celebrate nerdy!Let&#039;s all have a LAN party
&gt;&gt;2285099&gt;Because it&#039;s a nerdy white guy thing.Newfags knows nothing about the chinks. Now shut the fuck up and lurk for a month.
&gt;&gt;2285181&gt;tfw black and live in the actual hood&gt;can easily make more money for crypto by selling drugs but I hate that lifestyleMaking solid gains anyway
What&#039;s the realistic prediction for this beast of a coin in the future?i went to sleep hopping to wake up to find it at 1k sat, only to find it at 2.6k.Will it really reach $1 within 2017?Does it have a chance to go further beyond $1?
&gt;&gt;2284240Weird how people are only seeing the small picture here
&gt;&gt;2284260And that being?
&gt;&gt;2284240&gt;Will it really reach $1 within 2017?no it won&#039;t&gt;Does it have a chance to go further beyond $1?absolutely notDGB is trash that brings nothing new to the table. this is just another pump and dump
This will beat ETH
&gt;&gt;2284310&gt;DGB is trash that brings nothing new to the tableDGB transaction only take a few seconds to complete. It has wayyyyy higher IRL usability than any other crypto.
&gt;&gt;2284547&gt;Protip: it&#039;s not
a price of $1 will be a market cap of $8 billionnot happening
&gt;&gt;2284576Its gone from a market cap of 40 million to half a billion in 3 weeks...You really think DGB is just a pump and dump? It can easily hit 8 billion with the influx of new crypto investors. The entire market cap will hit a trillion in in a few months, 8 billion is nothing.The top 5 coins of 2018 will beBTC, ETC, XRP, DGB, BANCOR.Cap this you autistic nig nogs
&gt;&gt;2284622the coin is literally going to be redundant in a couple of months
DGB is smoke. Their flagship website has been down for at least a week.It&#039;s fueled by pajeets that actually believed there will be a LoL partnership and that believe there will be a minecraft partnershiup
&gt;&gt;2284547&gt;&gt;2284310It&#039;s fast as shit. 20x faster than BTC. First to activate Segwit. Easy as fuck to mine.You&#039;re delusional if you think it&#039;s a pump and dump,
&gt;&gt;2284657&gt;we&#039;re gonna dominate the gaming field with DGB&gt;Huge minecraft annoucement on the 6th&gt;oops it&#039;s actually just really fast no refundsAll alt-coins are &quot;really fast&quot; dipshit.
&gt;&gt;2284631are you implying most coins have an actual use rn
&gt;&gt;2284666Trips confirm.
&gt;&gt;2284310(You)
Just HODL
&gt;&gt;2284631DGB&#039;s block chain tech is better than BTC&#039;s or LTC&#039;s...It actually has a target audience, and is integrating itself into a billion dollar, tech savvy industry (video games). Stores in Germany and Japan are already accepting DGB as a currency. You can buy steam/facebook/gap etc gift cards online as we speak with DGB. Unlike 99.9% of other cryptocurrencies, DGB is ACTUALLY A CURRENCY that you can use to BUY STUFF.Minecraft server is going up, citibank announcement is coming, it&#039;s already usable in LOL and counterstrike go for in game items, and it can be mined as you play video games.You nondigi tards are honestly fucking retarded and so blinded by FOMO and rage that you cannot see a superior, socially relevant, commercially relevant, future top 5 crypto in front of your fucking eyes. It is absolutely laughable and sad. The masses understand will understand DGB, no one understands or gives a shit to understand coins like SIA/GOLEM which are not financially viable projects, they want to buy shit with their crypto currency.DGB has a market, has a marketing team, knows it&#039;s audience, is actually useful for buying things, and will rival BTC very soon. It will use the gigantic videogame platform as a lunar rocket launch pad and blast off into the next galaxy. Fuck the moon.Cap this faggots.
&gt;&gt;2284666I hope you&#039;re just a shillDigusign will get awareness out at the Citi conference. The minecraft server will be a success since mommy doesn&#039;t have to buy the players&#039; games any more. (You can currently buy video game giftcards at the Digibyte market place https://www.digibytemarket.com/en/shop/#!/d/home )You&#039;re a fucking joke dude, get out of here. DGB offers crazy use cases because it is the most versatile coin. They are deploying smart contracts in the next update too.All these facts STILL don&#039;t see it. Stay poor man.
&gt;&gt;2284622&gt;XRPlol no
&gt;&gt;2284725Found the guy who went all in at the ATH
&gt;&gt;2284622stop pretending like you know wtf you are saying...
&gt;&gt;2284307how you will no longer have to go through cashiers and you can just enter the store, pick something up and leave through the entrance and get scanned and get money deducted from your dgb account with 0 effort
it doesn&#039;t matter that it&#039;s a shit coin, that its integration with league and minecraft isnt what people thought (everyone knows the truth by now and have been passing around the reddit thread since it was like 700 sats). makes no difference to the price. the only fundamental that matters here is people&#039;s hysteria, and this has plenty of it. might take 2-3 weeks to pump again like it always does, and it might not ever actually hit $1, but it&#039;s not going to end anytime soon.
&gt;&gt;2284725lol kid, DGB&#039;s website has been down for several days now. The only thing I regret is not getting in on the pump and dump, but other than that, it&#039;s not getting anywhere.
&gt;&gt;2284775Actually I&#039;ve been in since 50 sats, and I went all in around 100 sats so I&#039;m very comfortable with my decision. Unlike you retards I actually do my DD and invest in coins that, not only do I believe in, but that have market viability as well.Many other coins are kind of cool conceptually, but will fail because they are too niche to build up a commercially viable user base. I&#039;m looking for the next big coin that will survive when the public (which is currently still oblivious to crypto) starts taking a look and pulling out their wallets...Current crypto traders represent a minuscule fraction of overall investment potential. 99.9% of people don&#039;t even know it exists yet. Ask yourself what you think your normal, everyday investor will buy when they start investing through their brokers.It will be BTC, ETH, XRP, DGB, Bancor.There will be others, but those 5 I mentioned will be the only survivors. Remember, people want CURRENCY, not some retarded ass niche coin like Golem. The average person does not do anything that requires a network super computer, but the average investor understands the massive potential of video games and DGB will use that as a platform into a main stream currency. It&#039;s very smart of them to do what they&#039;re doing.
Shitcoin or not. The fact that digibyte is at citi conference already makes it the top 1 coin for now.Theres no other coin that has a chance to get big like this one. None. No other coin has the chance to get big attention like digibyte on june 9. Youre weaklings that sold digibytes early and now you regret it, seeing as you slowly realize how hard this shit will raise the next days
&gt;&gt;2284813Okay, I get what you&#039;re saying...but you realize that this is possible with any crypto right? (I&#039;m a fan of DGB, I&#039;m just saying)
&gt;&gt;2285010i agree w pretty much everything youre saying, we probably have similar holdings.however, i think youre overlooking golems potential a lot. youre right, the avg person won&#039;t be using golem tokens. however, i think lots of companies will be it. the possibilities of golem for AI/VR companies could be massive, enough so that ive thrown some money into the project. not nearly as much as i have other coins that i like more, but i think to completely blow off golem&#039;s potential would be naive.
&gt;&gt;2284866yeah i remember reading posts like this after it &quot;pumped&quot; to 300 too
&gt;&gt;2284310
0coins which are only currently will have a failure rate at around 99% at this point with btc and eth dominating
&gt;&gt;2285097survival of the fittest
&gt;&gt;2285128u sure showed himwtf i lov dgb now
&gt;&gt;2284307Newcoiners panic selling at the first tiny dip
ARK is the next waves, big gains incoming. Don&#039;t miss this moon mission, anon. Who has tickets?
why would it moon? im serious.
&gt;&gt;2279693because it didnt moon yet
&gt;&gt;2279693Let&#039;s keep this between us but i&#039;ve noticed this price keep in line almost exactly with rads for the last day.
I&#039;m 20% of my holdings in and planning to grab more when other sells go through.Hurry up FLO, EXP and XPM I need you to moon already.
&gt;&gt;2279702Buy just 1, install the wallet and transfer it to yourself. You will see why.
&gt;&gt;2279702big volume increase and consolidating around 0.0002 about to break down walls.
&gt;&gt;2279693i am in ark. ready for flood of money.
Going to the moon. Got a ticket in that train and a good seat. Been shilling on fb groups and with friends
Ark guy keep the shilling down. I am trying to collect 1000 of those.
Ready for liftoff here
&gt;&gt;2279693So what do i get for voting ?
&gt;&gt;2279693Can someone give a short version of what ARK is about? Their website is nothing but buzzwords
&gt;&gt;2279931They have something called smart bridges which lets them connect to other blockchains. Therefore they can take advantage of the key features of other coins. They are combining this with applications for consumers, so that they are basically a super coin that can take on the powers of other coins.
ARK is the ringleader, the mastercoin.If they achieve what they claim, can easily become one of the top 3 coins.
Yes, my sell oder for HTML5 got throughMore ARK for this future chad
cmon fags, dump it again so I can buy cheap, volume seems to be decreasing
What percent gain do you see for this coin in the next year
&gt;&gt;2279931&gt;something something devs&gt;something something future tech n shit&gt;something something promising contracts with something something+ cool logo (an arrow pointing upwards, which means it will go to the moon)it dips at the moment, prepare to moon next weekend.why haven&#039;t you bought it yet?it looks like u want to stay poor.
Guys on which site can I buy it directly like on litebit? Problem on litebit is that there are no ARKs left.
&gt;&gt;2280584bittrex
&gt;&gt;2280366I am going to treat like I treated eth when it was 45 cents
&gt;&gt;2280647this man gets it!moon mission confirmed by digits a several times.those who didn&#039;t listen will regret it in their shitty fiat punto meme cars, while we chose the color of our lambos.yes lambos. not lambo.we will drown in lambos.
Can you FUCKING stopI HAVEN&#039;T GOT ENOUGH YOU FUCKS
&gt;&gt;2280694thisCrash it with no survivors for us, please!
Just bought 90 euros on ARK. You guys better have this right.
&gt;&gt;2280823We will, just hold
&gt;&gt;2280823Nice. Don&#039;t pump and dump, hold. watch what happens
&gt;&gt;2280875u mean hodl
I bought 100,000 $ARK when it was at 10k a week ago, this shit is gonna go to 100ksat by end of June.
&gt;&gt;2279693Got 500 coins in it now
&gt;&gt;2279721ease of use?
IM CONVINVED, SHOULD I BUY RIGHT NOW OR NOT???
Why is ARK a good investment for the future?
hodl for a month boys itll moon
Look at this shit, higher low each time it&#039;s dipped today. Ark is primed and ready to go to the moon. I hope you guys have bought your tickets.
Already bought a bunch, in 40 days and 40 nights I&#039;ll be rich
&gt;&gt;2281137It doesn&#039;t matter, if you believe in the product.(I do, I mean they&#039;ve got over 15 developers already: https://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/617335934128645241/)
&gt;&gt;2279956sounds like decredt. hodling 1.1k ARK
Don&#039;t forget to stake your coins in the ark wallet. I got about 1.5 free ark over the last two days for hodling. This is a great coin with great devs
Holding 20k ARK
Daily reminder that the lead dev of ARK programmed SATELLITES for the European Union.&gt;MFW /biz/ is holding onto coins made by no name retards and NOT holding onto coins made by literal rocket scientists
&gt;&gt;2282521Is there a limit to the amount you can hold until you get a stake or can you get a stake with 1 ARK
&gt;&gt;2282822Me too. I invested every penny I have.
forming an incredibly blatant meme triangle on Bittrex. can&#039;t help but throw more $$$$ at this.
transfer to ark wallet taking forever for anyone else?
&gt;&gt;228372588s m8
&gt;&gt;2283725It was pretty quick for me once bittrex actually sent it, which took a few minutes. That was a couple of hours ago though.
&gt;&gt;2283725never mind i&#039;m a fucking retard and didn&#039;t verify via email
&gt;&gt;2283981Happens to the best of us
&gt;&gt;2282903good choice
&gt;&gt;2283454oh lawd. i see it lawd. it&#039;s coming.
Had 800 and now bought 1.1k more - I am ready as fuck boys
&gt;tfw missed all previous trains but can&#039;t get BTC in time to buy this
so just like that anon picks one meme coin and goes all-in on it because of some meme triangles forminga sound strategy indeed
&gt;&gt;2284405
only worried i didn&#039;t buy enough..
&gt;&gt;2284497https://youtu.be/sxRStrx8xtc?t=3m6s
&gt;&gt;2284497it&#039;s mooning. it&#039;s happening breaking out of pennant now buy buy buy
aaaaaaaany second now...
BUYING
trying to buy this shit is VERY difficult. There isn&#039;t enough volume, and your 1k+ bid order is sitting a long time in the order book.Anyone care to explain to me why there is such a big gap between BID and ASK prices. And why are people selling only a small portion at a time? like under 300
&gt;&gt;2279693&gt;bought ant instead of ark by mistakefuck bros
is that the tripple rebound then the moon graph
&gt;&gt;2284695Yeah I think it&#039;s a bot that is selling all those tiny sub 100 ARK orders.Honestly, I&#039;d just decide how much you want, find that number in the sum column, and put in an order for it at that price.Bittrex automatically will buy up all the ones lower than that rate so it&#039;s not like that&#039;s exactly what you&#039;ll be paying. I don&#039;t see ARK staying at around 16-17k much longer, especially with that pronounced meme triangle
&gt;&gt;2284772the technicals have it hitting 30k plus
ARK will be 50000 SAT by the end of June.
waiting for my btc deposit into bittrex now.............
&gt;&gt;2279956so ark is /chad/?
&gt;mfw i triggered the orders
&gt;tfw only 72 Ark&gt;tfw next paycheck doesn&#039;t drop into my account until friday&gt;tfw takes time to turn into BTC
Damn boys im excited !!!!!!!!
Don&#039;t forget to read their whitepaper, too.This coin has actual value.&gt;https://ark.io/whitepaper/
&gt;&gt;2284922sell ath then buy dip ?
&gt;&gt;2282403I CANT GET IN. COINMAMA BEN DOWN FOR 3 DAYS.Coinbase has told me the numbers I wrote in for credit card verification are wrong... TWICE now..Changelly and others are telling me that they do not sell to Americans.I&#039;m going to starve REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Will 1000 of them get me a Lambo by Christmas?
&gt;&gt;2284405&gt;&gt;2284429HOW TO DO IT, HMM?&gt;&gt;2284941
&gt;&gt;2284931buy now it&#039;s breaking out of a pennant. i&#039;d hurry.
&gt;&gt;2284961Did Coinbase deposit 3 different amounts?
&gt;&gt;2284941try blockchain.info
looks like the start of a breakout right now
&gt;&gt;2284961you&#039;d need to find a local bitcoin atm or do localbitcoins if you&#039;re really in a hurry. lucky for me, i live in a big city and there&#039;s one in a nearby mall.
&gt;&gt;2284961never had problems with coinbase other than jew feesbetter hope for a dip during the half hour it takes to transfer bitcoin
&gt;yfw ARK gets added to polo
&gt;&gt;2282521How do you stake them in the wallet?
nxt 12hrs ll b awsm
I have 2000 of these and just bought into that wall you fucks better do your part
&gt;&gt;2285044Buying
can someone tell me why people are immediately sending their ARK to their ARK Wallets?Are they able to get more doing that?
&gt;&gt;2284978They did the first time. It asks for first order, so i type first one they sent.Today i got the same 2 last numbers of yesterday&#039;s when I redid it.&gt;&gt;2284986Closest is at a gas station 50 minutes away.&gt;&gt;2284980&gt;*Our buy Bitcoin feature is currently only available for users within the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Monaco and San Marino...This is discrimination :(
&gt;&gt;2285070Safer than keeping it on an exchange
I have 500 Sia and 168 Ark. Is Sia dead? Should I sell my SIA to buy ARK or hodl?
&gt;&gt;2285121you&#039;re better off buying 200$ worth of btc or eth and use that instead, those gains will be minimal
&gt;&gt;2285121Sia&#039;s just starting. They plan to launch decentralized video streaming this year. It&#039;s basically good for 10 - 50x in the next 6 months.
&gt;&gt;2285121you have some weak as fuck hands. You&#039;re not gonna make any money with your hands.
&gt;&gt;2282880&gt;not a russian programmerDROPPED
Iv got BTC LTC im holding. I took $150 and wanted to day trade with it to see what I could gain
Thoughts on UBQ and Shift? Any potential there?I have 70 Ark, but contemplating on selling some of the other coins and investing in ARK maybe even SC for the ride..
Cloak is about to pass PIVX&#039;s volume on bittrex. Massive pump incoming. Looking like it could do 300-400%
It passed it. It also just passed zcash. Yessss
&gt;&gt;2284308At this rate it will pass golem in the next two hours.
&gt;&gt;2284436Maybe the next hour. The volume is blowing up right now.
&gt;&gt;2284480Maybe. We&#039;ll see. Either way the volume is growing rapidly.
&gt;&gt;2284253is it time to buy?
&gt;&gt;2284671It&#039;s been stable here for the last few hours and the volume keeps going up. It&#039;s gonna pop anytime now. There is only 5 million coins and a 12 million dollar market cap so it wouldn&#039;t take much money to get this thing to pump to insane amounts.
&gt;&gt;2284774but is it just pump &amp;dump or does it have something to offer.
&gt;&gt;2284865many gains
&gt;&gt;2284865It&#039;s not a pump and dump. Jesus christ. It just pumped and then people took profits.Cloak coin has a permanent decentralized network for completely anonymous transactions. It also gives you 6% interest on all coins that you hold every year.Check it out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzlP69bwHkc
&gt;&gt;2285148So its a scam pump.
&gt;&gt;2284253&gt;&gt;2284671it just broke the 100k sat wall. seems like it imo
&gt;&gt;2285158&gt;permanent decentralized network for completely anonymous transactions.so what does it offer that 99999 other coins dont?

SIA is going through the roof soon.Don&#039;t tell me I didn&#039;t warn you.
Agreed. Unlike the other shitcoins shilled on here, Sia has strong fundamentals. The economics of decentralized storage are sound. It&#039;s only a matter of time until people start using it at scale.
&gt;&gt;2283560Not even a shill.SIA SIA SIA
&gt;&gt;2283560If it breaks 800 sats I&#039;ll throw a party
Wallet maintenance on bittrexWhy
it already went to 700+ while i was sleeping and i couldn&#039;t short it and buy lower.I hope it gets over 800+ soon.
Could literallyy pick any coins on pol and say its going to moon
It&#039;s happening, lads. Sell wall about to be broken.
Look at the volume! Whales are in, going to the MOON.
I BOUGHT MY TICKETS AND READY TO BLAST OFF

&gt;&gt;2284408think it will break 700 this time or gay shit?
&gt;&gt;2284427Obviously, at least 800 SATS this time.
&gt;&gt;2284427800 SAT tonight, dont tell I didnt warn you
&gt;&gt;2284427It&#039;ll go above 1k before the end of the week, compare the chart to DGB pre 1k.
&gt;why didn&#039;t you buy me when I Was still under 1000 sats, anonkun?
Have any of you actually tried using the Sia client?http://sia.tech/apps/It&#039;s not an installer, it&#039;s a .zip - download it and test it, see what impressions it gives you.
&gt;&gt;2284555Fuck no, I&#039;m not wasting my time on fundamentals when DGB rose so much.
&gt;&gt;2283682Wtf how long will this take to fix?

&gt;&gt;2283837This seems pretty intredasting, in fact
&gt;&gt;2283906just giving you a hintthe actuall pump won&#039;t happen before tomorrow evening

&gt;&gt;2284180i have literly no advantage by telling you thisbut since /biz/ got me into this and helped me making some easy money i thought i&#039;d share some info
&gt;&gt;2284180You holding his bags
what is the full name of this coin?
&gt;&gt;2284207https://kidscoin.co.nz/
&gt;&gt;2284207I know searching &quot;buying kids with bitcoins&quot; doesn&#039;t show relevant info
&gt;&gt;2284243&gt;ostensibly a coin to teach children about money and savings&gt;literally a pump and dump schemethis might be the best one yet
&gt;&gt;2284126ok OP I will get in with just 0.03BTC just to bet my poket change and see what happens

Okay, faggots, I&#039;m in. Let&#039;s fucking gamble!Just transferred my coins to YoBit (luckily enough, a Dogecoin deposit only takes 15 minutes to get approved).Somehow, watching how the wall is thinning out made me feel anxious

im out.
Hardly no one w as able to get in on the ico, it sold out in like 10 seconds
If you&#039;re not in now then you hate money and you will KYS this time next year

&gt;mfwwell that was a nice dip.Last chance on board cucks
&gt;&gt;2282039Hold on to it. It&#039;s going to be added to polo
yes&gt;&gt;2281939yes you mine by running the brave browser kek
&gt;&gt;2282009think we hit the bottom
&gt;&gt;2282040this is not the last chance. this will rise and then crash hard when whales get rid of their collections. then there will be slow rise through the year. so sell in the next rise
BLOCKCHAIN CONFIRMS AREN&#039;T ACTING FAST ENOUGH I WANNA BUY THE DIP REEEEEEEEE
Get back inI was going to sell at .27 cents but the whales are just manipulating the market.If you bought last night HOLD!This coin has only been live for 6 hrs, way more gains to be had.
&gt;&gt;2282044Time to cast my hands in steel
&gt;&gt;2282040bottom lasted like 30sec, waiting for next1
Why don&#039;t the whales let this grow for awhile before they sell.
anyone considered setting up a raspberry pi that is constantly watching ads on the BAT browser?could be profitable especially with future gain%btw. thats a huge red candle :D
&gt;&gt;2282070they likely sell a few inbetween and as soon as they broke even they will let it go high
&gt;&gt;2282070just wait a little while itll dip again. itll do another 11000
&gt;&gt;2282070Cos they already doubled their money
&gt;&gt;2282090x6 actually but as a whale myself, I am planning to wait it out till it gets added to polo
&gt;&gt;2282070It&#039;s just some weak hands that sell. Nothing to worry. I don&#039;t sell before we hit at least 20k.
&gt;&gt;2282081surely they aren&#039;t stupid enough to let this happen
&gt;&gt;2281741IRON HANDS M&#039;LORD
i reckon it&#039;ll hit atleast 14k again today.
Don&#039;t miss out.
&gt;&gt;2282158itll hit 11000 again just wait it out
&gt;&gt;2282205Ico price was $.035 current price is $.31https://icostats.com/Idk friend, I have decided to cut my losses and wait for the dip
&gt;&gt;2282158RRRRRRWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Mithril hands get lambos
&gt;&gt;2282280dip&#039;s been an gone. on to new heights.
&gt;&gt;2282280&gt;.035&gt;now 10x the price overnightYeah I think I&#039;ll buy in some other time, boys.
&gt;&gt;2282311This is the time to buy you idiot.Any whale with half a brain cell will see the momentum this coin has and expect x20. Just look at the trade volume doubling in hours.
&gt;&gt;2282339i have legit guessed every rise and fall of this so far.will have a second, smaller dip after it hits 14 again, then on to the moon. (depending on sell whales)
&gt;&gt;2282380Whales set the initial price high to rope in suckers. Once people realize they gettin played the price will drop
&gt;&gt;228239314900 ask wall incoming trust me.
&gt;&gt;2282393won&#039;t happen today though.
&gt;could&#039;ve bought in at 8k in the morning yet finally only decided now at 13k.Well I made a small loss due to being a scaredy cat, I think this will explode in a few months.
honestly things are getting out of control, it will explode in a few hours/days
&gt;&gt;2282415itll dip again, porbly 12000 now than 11000 than i last said
You can&#039;t loose with this coin.Look at the other coin with no team/no idea - they are mooning.You don&#039;t even need to shill this coin, it&#039;s pure gold!
&gt;&gt;2281741considering putting down .3eth at around 12k satoshi mark, what are rational expectations for gains??
&gt;&gt;2282465That&#039;s fine, but I made a few misses before when waiting for dips. Remember there is not just one whale group, you never know when a pump is due for what.
50 btc to 14kExpecting a correction? I am already +80%, maybe sell half and buy back more cheaper?What you guys think?
&gt;&gt;228249130% by end of day, it going to be bouncing between 15000 and 11000-12000
&gt;&gt;2282500do it.its what ive done
&gt;&gt;2282505what gives you hope for BAT? it&#039;s pretty sparse in the meme department and I&#039;m eyeballing bitbeans with my extra gains investments.
&gt;&gt;2282158bought just before the dipkill me
Missed out on strat, missed out on eth, missed out on Xvg, missed out on eth. Didn&#039;t miss out on bat though. Thank you lord
&gt;&gt;2281741Clever LARP
&gt;&gt;2282523because this has utility and developed by people going back as far as netscape days, memes are unneccessary... comparing to bitbeans.... lets just say one of the leading founders of javascript is quite overpar to some devs in new hampshire who wont reveal themselves and work on their &quot;bean&quot; &quot;part-time&quot;
Whales set up 2 walls one to drive the price down and one to pick up the panic sells. Watched it last night with sia.
&gt;&gt;2282575oh shit wrong thread lel
So does anyone think BAT is a good long-term coin, or is it only going to be good for a month or two? I think it might be good long-term especially if advertisers get on board and the dev team remain active on it.I dunno if it will hit $10 a coin but I think it has potential.
&gt;&gt;2282580fair enough, but don&#039;t be too hard on bean holders, I could have doubled by money the past few days if I bought in at 50 sats. It seems like a pretty reliable swing trade if you keep beans on the mind. You sold me on BAT though, I&#039;ve put in an order at 120250 sats for when it dips.
&gt;&gt;2282626it is definitely a 1 dollar coin
&gt;&gt;2282626Just wait till it hits poloniex
Fill it in if you want moonhttps://m.poloniex.com/coinRequest
&gt;&gt;2282505As i said 1200 incoming
choo choo!
stupid gay coin and stupid gay biz
&gt;&gt;2282823stay mad pajeet, we still havn&#039;t had most of america and asia open up to it.
I&#039;m debating picking up some of this coin. Seems like now would kind of be the right time (?) but I don&#039;t want to sell any of my RDD for it as RDD has been pulling me out of the 1btc deep hole I&#039;ve been in.
&gt;it was 7k sat last night&gt;the shills were saying it would increase&gt; I didn&#039;t listen
&gt;&gt;2282879&gt;he fell for the kike saying it would tank&gt;he probably still believes the same kike in this thread saying it will tankStupid goy. He&#039;s just trying to make people sell so he can drive the price down and buy.
&gt;&gt;2282879tfw bought it at 7k
&gt;&gt;22829726.8k rite here bb ;)
Literally pajeetcoin
&gt;&gt;2283146&gt;&gt;2282823&gt;&gt;2282058:^)
&gt;&gt;2283222BAT is, yes.
&gt;&gt;2281741It&#039;s got some extreme horizontal price movement right now. What&#039;s gonna happen /biz/?To the /moon/ or to the /core/?
uuuuuuuh........guys?
&gt;&gt;2283291Bought at the core so it&#039;s easy riding for me lol I see this slowly stabilizing on a lower end before mooning again in a month.
&gt;&gt;2283520It&#039;s bots bro. The wall will move back if everything in front of it gets bought.
&gt;&gt;2283520once the whales have distributed the coins this will look more even. People just buy BAT up, because they know it is oging to be huge
waiting for my deposit to come
&gt;&gt;2283545&gt;&gt;2283568UUUHHHH.... GUYS ?????
&gt;&gt;2283520Looked very similar to that last night before it took off. Had about 2 mini walls and one huge wall
&gt;&gt;2283592sell now
DROPPING TERRIBLY FAST... SELL SELL MY GOD
NOTHIS WASNT SUPPOSED TO HAPPENNON O
&gt;&gt;2283610&gt;buying thislmao
Don&#039;t listen to the faggots saying this will tank.Already doubled my money from last night. Feeling gooood.

&gt;&gt;2283675not buying your bags
&gt;&gt;2283675myself again, your also being played and other id&#039;s before by&gt;&gt;2283592. The token is muhc bigger thn this.
&gt;&gt;2283683my bags started at 6k. its an oppurtunity for the next 1-4 weeks. Your hands now, not mine.
&gt;&gt;2283715you realize it&#039;s going to get dumped once it touches polo, right
in an hourWE SHALL KNOW THE FATE OF THIS COIN
just bought 521. Lets see where this ride goes.
&gt;&gt;2283752Shit is gonna spike at the triangle. You heard it here first.
&gt;&gt;2283736how does adding to another exchange decrease its value? What makes you so certain its even going to get added to polo?the charts been pretty easy for now i told people to get in 10k to 12k theres 20-30pct for them short term by EOD.
Bitcoin: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamEthereum: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamStratis: Cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamBAT: Overpriced ICO, attempting to take everything it can from public, 95% owned by less than 100 people (35million in dev pocket)Overpriced shitty ICOs ruin a company before it&#039;s even bornDo the maths brainlets, feel free to buy Whale bags if you want to get owned
&gt;&gt;2283771very high volume with 200 whales = your asses are going to get dumped on
&gt;&gt;2283789those whales or corps who got in at ico would make a exchange account within 1 day of listing. get fucking real.
WHY ISNT IT GOING UP REE
&gt;&gt;2283802are you retarded? it isn&#039;t on polo yet.
&gt;&gt;2283785why is stratis freefalling then
&gt;&gt;2283811you just said it would dump when it gets on polo, your own fucking words... i asked you what makes you so certain going on another excahnge it will dump... and how you even know whether its going on polo?
&gt;&gt;2283785they have hundreds of thousands of users and some of the top software engineers in world on this. this guy CREATED JavaScript, co-CREATED Firefox.. he is not your average crypto scammer. But keep spreading your FUD. Are you holding green beans or whatever it was called?
&gt;&gt;2283820HIGH VOLUME EXCHANGEIT WILL DUMPWHALES NEED HIGH VOLUME AND HIGH PRICE TO DUMPPOLO IS HIGH VOLUME EXCHANGEBAT ON POLO = YOU ALL KYScan you understand that?you&#039;re a fucking retard. and of course it&#039;s going on polo. it has gotten requests every fucking day to go onto polo because the W H A L E S WANT TO DUMP IT.
&gt;&gt;2283818It could fall to $4, the overall growth is still exponential. I expect it will continue to grow in coming years&gt;&gt;2283822&gt;i bought whale bags, the post&gt;dev stole 35 million from publickek, overpriced shit tier ico scam coin
&gt;&gt;2283822So what exactly did they need 35 million for ?
&gt;&gt;2283839Dude are you retarded or what? If whales WANTED to dump, they would&#039;ve already done it. They have more ways than fucking polo.
&gt;&gt;2283878sure thing buddy, how much BAT do you own ?
&gt;&gt;2283890Only 600. But dude, you really think whales can&#039;t dump atm because it&#039;s not on polo?Go check yourself for retardness.
&gt;&gt;2283902ok babby brainlet, enjoy ur big boy BAT tokens
&gt;&gt;2283913gb2 to discord
&gt;&gt;2283878&gt;&gt;2283902of course you own some, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be blinding yourself with such obvious and typical whale activity. there is zero buy support and it is climbing to 10x the ICO. how fucking stupid are you? degenerate gamblers are the worst. it will hit polo, have much more volume, and it will be dumped.
&gt;&gt;2283785&gt;bitcoin ICO
&gt;&gt;2283936&gt;&gt;2283890Fuck off scammers. You were pulling this thing last night at 7k. We&#039;re not selling you our coins.If you&#039;re a newfag, don&#039;t be retarded. Just hodl.
&gt;&gt;2282106What are they gonna do to prevent it?
So when exactly do you expect it to hit polo?
&gt;&gt;2283965&gt;we tell them what is going to happen to their potential gains&gt;&quot;FUCK OFF SCAMMERS!&quot;like i said, degenerate gamblers are the worst.
scamcoinno one is going to switch browsers just to watch adsuse only for pumping and dumping no HODL
&gt;&gt;2282879I only bought 200 @ 7K lastnight should have bought more
&gt;&gt;2282055how is that supposed to work. can not find any screen that hints at BAT in the browser itself
&gt;&gt;2283995&gt;It blocks ads and trackers&gt;you get paid to watch ads&gt;publishers get paid when people watch their ads&gt;It saves data&gt;It saves power&gt;browser is aesthetic, simple, and easy to use&gt;Uses blockchain tech to provide real-tie data of ad-campaign efficacyThis is revolutionary tech, and it is going to Jupiter and then Andromeda.What&#039;s not to like.

&gt;&gt;2284648i got up to tier 3 in 1 weekcya later in my lambo you faggot autistic nignogs with 0 people skills lmaoyes i am a chad
10 hours? 2 weeks my friend.
&gt;&gt;2284908what weird-ass country are you from
XBY has been subject to constant FUD ever since the project started. We&#039;ve had one nutjob that has been fudding all day at his computer for the last couple days. Ever since this rise, the FUD has gotten super intense and spiteful. It really makes you think...The truth is, is that there is not enough evidence to call this a scam. We have alot of angry people who sold early and are upset because they know the coin is going places. That&#039;s the truth about XBY and why you see so many fudding threads. An investment like this is not for everyone, there is risk involved, but if the devs wanted to pump and dump that would have already happened already. They would have put this thing on Bittrex and dumped it. And yes, Bittrex would have accepted the coin regardless.I&#039;ve been in their Slack for awhile now. Every day this looks less and less like a scam and more like a legitimate project. There is coding being done in a private repository on Git, that&#039;s how the pros do it.I would be extremely wary of people Fudding this to kingdom come. When coins have gotten this kind of intense FUD, they super moon afterwards (like Monero).
&gt;&gt;2282482
&gt;&gt;2282482&gt;this is op
I kept reading about how this coin was awesome and undervalued and that it had a great community. Then I actually looked into and I found that it was full of retards and no one could actually explain what the purpose of the coin was or how it worked.Anyway, I bought some, it more than doubled in price and then I dumped that shit.
&gt;&gt;2282537Smart op - take the money and run!
Whaddya know, Dutch fag makes the first posts in this thread. Get a life you weirdo. This is the guy OP mentioned in his post. He&#039;s a fucking weirdo that&#039;s been fudding this all day. OP speaks truth. Im probably going to buy more on the incoming dip.
&gt;&gt;2282482Lol, 100% of the shills for this coin spend all their free time saying it&#039;s not a scam.THERE IS NO WHITE PAPERTHE DEV IS A DEAF AUTISTIC HUNGARIAN, lolTHE MARKETER SAID HIS MOTHERS SPIRIT IS PROTECTING THE PRICE OF THE COINJust gas yourself
&gt;&gt;2282537Stop lying
&gt;&gt;2282482Why is their website and writing so shitty? Is English their first language?
To everyone reading - this is what you get when you get a hot coin on the rise. The fudders come out of the woodwork :) Thanks for proving my points.
&gt;&gt;2282600that doesnt seem shilly at all
&gt;&gt;2282502&gt;&gt;2282532&gt;&gt;2282537&gt;&gt;2282585&gt;&gt;2282639YOU ARE PROVING OP&#039;S POINT YOU RETARDS. using old recycled arguments of &quot;No Whitepaper&quot; and &quot;website reads like a 5 year old wrote it&quot; anyone can do 5 minutes of research and find out why things are the way they arefucking morons, this just proves you have crazy wackjobs on biz that will jump on a thread 3 min after its created a fud it LMAOanyone with half a brain can see XBY is a coin with massive potential fudders prove it
&gt;&gt;2282754&gt;compensating this much
&gt;&gt;2282557He&#039;s had a few hours sleep from his net wide 35 hour trolling yesterday.
&gt;there is not enough evidence to call this a scamSounds like something a scammer would sayWhere&#039;s the code, faggot?&gt;its t-too super s-secret amazing to release publicly!!1nigger please, everyone develops publicly in this space
&gt;&gt;2284222Code&#039;s on github
&gt;&gt;2284341all I see is some shitwallet they keep updating, almost like they&#039;re propping the community up on nothing but lies...............
Step up the crypto trading game, add me on Skype: CryptoAnna
&gt;&gt;2284341No it isn&#039;t.No code + no whitepaper + constant shilling = Obvious ScamFuck off back to plebbit and btctalk, scamming faggot shitcunt
&gt;&gt;2284400Tone downhttps://github.com/borzalom/XtraBYtes
Not even shilling, bought at 30 sats and sold most recentlyJust curious about the potential
&gt;&gt;2284434&gt;last commit 10 hrs ago&gt;edits to README textSCAM
&gt;&gt;2284462The Github is skeleton code right now. The development is being done on a private repo. Yeah, we all know what you are going to say &quot;It&#039;s private therefore it&#039;s a scam&quot;. You have no proof of it being a scam. You say its done publicly on this space, but that&#039;s not entirely true either. Not everything is done publicly.
who cares if its a scam or not, im here to make moneyi personally dont give two shits about bitcoin, ether, xby or any other blockchain meme coins, i only care about the potential price increaseyou are people need to get your heads out of your asses and stop &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;support&quot; these coins, this is /biz/ afterall, not /g/
&gt;&gt;2284605We all want to make money, anon. You&#039;ll make more in the long run by investing in legitimate coins, desu.
&gt;&gt;2284630What are the legitimate ones :S?
&gt;&gt;2284561&gt;You have no proof of it being a scamAll I need to hear. Sold.
&gt;&gt;2284605This. I have 300k XBY, to me this is a high risk, high reward investment.&gt;Is the lack of commits to the github sketchy?Yes.&gt;Is it possible they are working on a private repository?Yes they have said they are and it makes sense as if the tech is truly a new concept and &#039;revolutionary&#039;, they have an incentive to keep it under wraps while it&#039;s being developed.One thing that makes me confident in the programmer&#039;s abilities is that a new repository was recently created with skeleton code: https://github.com/XtraBYtes/core/ and there is a commit showing the genesis block. The guy has at least some idea of what he is doing.Right now i&#039;m thinking this is 90% legit, 10% scam/tech unable to be implemented.That&#039;s good enough for me desu. If this takes off i&#039;ll be rich, if not gg cu next coin
&gt;&gt;2284649Coins that have:&gt;Whitepaper&gt;Solid development team (identities publicly known)&gt;Open source software&gt;Institutional backing (think major IT/Financial companies organizations i.e. Microsoft, Forbes, etc)&gt;ICO release with a finished product preferredXBY has none of these things. The supposed dev is some dead autist from Hungary, who doesn&#039;t even have a picture of himself on his shit-tier website. There is no whitepaper (CUZ THE CODE IS SO 1337) and the actual coin is literally a recycled version of another shitcoin that got abandoned by the original devs, and was only taken up by &quot;Borzalom&quot; because it meant he didn&#039;t have to actually make a viable product when it is in fact easier to shill a rebranded shit coin to gullible speculators.Combine these facts with the &quot;Marketer&quot; spending 100% of his time on YouTube and the slack autistically trying to prove his &quot;product&quot; isn&#039;t a scam, not by actually providing a whitepaper or code, but by simply saying, &quot;it&#039;s no a scam, how dare you, lol&quot;
&gt;&gt;2282482kys turkroach no one is buying your bags, its only your fault you have fell to that scamcoin.
&gt;&gt;2284705i have 120k im on the same boat. high risk high reward
&gt;&gt;2284705&gt;300kcare to spare some bruh? i&#039;m sitting at only 420(blaze it)0BP57KG3MZDqeaxDBS5CEGnUvQZRm9VTwsA
&gt;&gt;2284705What exactly is the tech? Can anyone eli5 it to an on-techie?
&gt;&gt;2284736&gt;Whitepapers don&#039;t mean shit, it&#039;s a meme&gt;Many coins were developed with anonymous teams&gt;Alot of open source projects were originally developed privately and then had core code released as open source&gt;Institutional backing doesn&#039;t guarantee anything&gt;ICO&#039;s are actually easier scams, genius&gt;&quot;Marketer&quot; spending 100% of his time on YouTube and the slack autistically trying to prove his &quot;product&quot; isn&#039;t a scam,Hey I&#039;m not fan of the marketing guy, but he doesnt spend all of his time on youtube, he spends a fair amount of his time on Slack. He was there helping people set up their nodes.XBY is sketchy, but there are clues to it being a legitimate project. Calling it a scam isn&#039;t right though either. We don&#039;t have enough evidence to call it either way. It&#039;s a gamble, yes. Confirmed scam? Don&#039;t know.
&gt;&gt;2284781*non
&gt;&gt;2284815Ah, a true believer. Enjoy getting raped by the Red Army.
&gt;&gt;2284845I just said XBY is sketchy but you call me a true believer. Take some classes in reading comprehension.
&gt;&gt;2284736&gt;WhitepaperFrom the start of the project this was heralded as an experimental coin. Borzalom has had ideas about proof of signature for a long time and decided this was the project he wanted to test them on. Devs have said that the whitepaper will be made when the tech is nearing completion. As a software dev myself, this makes perfect sense, a lot of the times you have an idea about how your software is going to be built but plenty of changes can occur along the way.&gt;Solid development team (identities publicly known)Fair point, i can see how an investor could find this worrying. For what it&#039;s worth if i&#039;m in borzalom&#039;s place i would be hesitant making my identity public. It&#039;s an experimental coin, if he fucks up the tech or fails to complete the project people are going to be pissed. If this was your regular ICO, where a whitepaper has been produced and everyone is confident that goals will be achieved, devs are going to be much more willing tom reveal their identities since success is more or less guaranteed. For what it&#039;s worth, PIVX devs are anonymous, Satoshi is anonymous.&gt;Open source softwareAddressed somewhat in my previous post. Development is in it&#039;s early stages.&gt;Institutional backing (think major IT/Financial companies organizations i.e. Microsoft, Forbes, etc)Come on dude, this is in no way a necessity for a coin to be a profitable investment.&gt;ICO release with a finished product preferredThey didn&#039;t do an ICO because the project started as a fork of an existing scamcoin. Imagine if borzalom completed the XBY project and got the tech working first then held an ICO. Starting price of XBY would be $0.10 or something. That&#039;s why this investment is high reward, the price is extremely low right now if the tech pulls through.
1.3M XBY holder here. I&#039;ll be laughing at you guys come December 2017 :D
Looking for an undervalued coin to buy?Decred is a blockchain store of value. Changes to the system are decided by voting by stakeholders (coin owners). Compare to Bitcoin (future controlled by miner oligopoly) or Ethereum (future controlled by Russian skeleton man.)The voting system is innovative in that it encourages holding. Voting requires holding of funds for about a month, with interest returned on funds on return. Currently 40% of all tokens are being used in voting. Voting = holding = limited supply = steady price increase. Since much of the funds are in hodl land, violent price dips are also much less likely than other coins.Voting on lightning network ends in about a week. Expect a significant uptick in interest and price then.&gt;inb4 shill accusationsOf course I&#039;m holding DCR. I got in at 0.09 and strongly believe in the project. I&#039;ve made a bunch of money from tips on this board so I thought I&#039;d return the favor by putting together this infographic and sharing my 2 cents. I&#039;ve already put as much fiat into crypto as I can afford so I don&#039;t have anything to gain from keeping the price low.If you make mad gainz from this post be sure to tip 0.1 DCR to DsjSe9BxsEFnepdCwi4JUQazN8wCdykJLKs
Saw this posted before does sound very interesting will throw some shekels at it
Redpill me on this stuff...Is Bancor gonna moon?
&gt;&gt;2283395Possibly
IS it gonna moon? Yes, no doubt.Are you gonna be able to beat out whales and actually buy into the ICO? Hell fucking no lmaoJust hope you can buy in early enough once it hits the exchanges and still make a decent profit.
yes
No highly hyped ICO has ever lost money since launch:https://icostats.com/roi-since-ico
Who the hell needs Bancor when you can have ARK?
Anyone else afraid to miss the opportunity to buy in @ Bitcoin Suisse? I dont want to sell my other bags for funds just yet
&gt;&gt;2283578Idiot. In most cases it would have been beneficial to just keep your money in ethereum.
&gt;&gt;2284069&gt;sorting it and looking at it like a moronKYS
&gt;&gt;2283731They aren&#039;t competitors; in fact, they&#039;re friendly towards each other
&gt;&gt;2283405&gt;&gt;2283395anybody have ideas on which exchanges will be listing it first?
&gt;&gt;2283988wish i could but its non-US only..
&gt;&gt;2284212liqui.io generally has ICO up fastest
what date will it be on an exchange?
Bancor is Jewish so it will be big.http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech/At-TEDx-in-Tel-Aviv-talk-of-advancing-crypto-currencies-like-Bitcoin-479559
Will the ico be different from BAT?I mean BAT said where to send everything before the ICO, not the moment it started so people obviously prepared. Will bancor do the same?
&gt;&gt;2284563probably
Unless you&#039;re a whale who can spend &gt;$3000 on gas during the ICO, this will disappear in under 30 seconds again, and you&#039;ll be buying at 6x the price on Bittrex. ICOs are not for those with under five figures to throw around.
&gt;&gt;2283395&gt;look into Bancor&gt;see the dev team is Israeli&gt;lose all interest in it
&gt;&gt;2285009Anon...Jews never lose at money. Not investing is a guaranteed way to stay poor.
&gt;&gt;2285029&quot;I will not derive any profit from the enemies of Christ&quot; - Elizabeth of Russia

This meme is making x1000 profits since the ICO explain this
&gt;&gt;228452610,000 numb nuts.
&gt;didn&#039;t overcharge on ICO kept the marketcap down initially, and let the companies performance do the talking&gt;gains were madeMost ICOs sole purpose is to gain as much revenue as possible, whereas other companies literally just need some start up funds
&gt;&gt;2284541Really?
&gt;&gt;2284587I misspoke as well.
&gt;&gt;2284526what the fuck you call graph like these
&gt;&gt;2284720Resistence
&gt;&gt;2284720Money printers
&gt;&gt;2284720Predictable. Buy low sell high in that range, free money
Will stratis at some point stop PoW and switch to PoS or will you be able to choose?
&gt;&gt;2285025You can already choose
&gt;&gt;2285046Thank you.Are there any examples of anyone using this in the wild?
&gt;&gt;2285067None that I know
&gt;&gt;2285133I see that it legit connected with Microsoft Azure. It costs 67 bucks to get a pre-built box for Stratis. How often would this be used. Would most developers prefer to set up their own environment?
Beth ico starts in 4 hoursAre you anons ready for buying your lambos?https://beth.jp/
WTF is this shit
This is a schemer coin, go do some research.
i&#039;ve never heard of this and the one bitcointalk thread makes it sound like a bona fide scam. pass
FINALLY got ride of this pure fucking shitcoin. I apologize to everyone for shilling so hard on here for it; a man&#039;s gotta sell his bags somehow. I&#039;m just glad there was one final small pump so I didn&#039;t have to take as massive of a hit.&gt;tfw gave away almost all my ETH in April for this garbageI missed out on $40,000. Forty thousand fucking dollars because I didn&#039;t hold ETH.Anyway, I have about $6,000 in BTC I salvaged from this wreck, what should I put it in to see Stratis-like gains?
fuck he has a point
Big announcement Monday, goys
&gt;&gt;2285137At least he&#039;s talking to Putin now. That&#039;s not something to cause anyone concern. /s
If fluffypansy thinks you are speculating he will also destroy your money
Why aren&#039;t you buying $ROBO the global robotics&amp;automation ETF to inoculate yourself against the future of fully automated jobs?
&gt;&gt;2284957because Ive made 150k with digibyte in the last wek
&gt;&gt;2284957you are right OP better buy more digibyte now
&gt;&gt;2284957&gt;Why aren&#039;t you buying $ROBOI have no idea how to buy them.I am trying to get into a bitcoins but after 2 days I haven&#039;t bought even one.What do I do wrong.
&gt;&gt;2285117you buy ROBO like any other stock
I have an employee I hired for the summer. She&#039;s a J1 visa student, hired from an exchange agency. She had worked in the US before, and 8 days after she arrived she tells me that her manager from her last job of 2 years ago and is offering her a position for more money. However I am familiar with the area, the price of living is substantially higher. I&#039;m under no obligation to send her right the fuck back to the Eastern Bloc shit hole she comes from. I&#039;m a newer business owner. How should I handle the situation? She does good work, but I have other employees. I&#039;d previously given them applications to work at a restaurant I&#039;m associated with, and she hadn&#039;t even filled out the form or informed me how many hours she&#039;d like to work there. She says she came here to earn money. She&#039;s not punctual, apparently come in at 9 means come in at 9:10 and grab a coffee. But she does do good work. I don&#039;t know how I should handle the situation. Someone enlighten me. I already have my mind made up to an extent, but if anyone has any experience with a situation similar I&#039;d be very interested in how you handled it.
Glad to know actual business discussion is ignored around here.
You need to tell her straight up that she should get her shit together and actually be punctual. Tell her if she wants to leave then bye, she is trying to influence you with that other job shit but you&#039;re the boss at the end of the day senpai. And yes i&#039;ve been in a similar situation
&gt;come in at 9 means come in at 9:10Nothing sets my &#039;tism off like someone who does this every single fucking day
&gt;She&#039;s not punctual, apparently come in at 9 means come in at 9:10 and grab a coffee. But she does do good work.Holy shit who cares? Are you profiting?
Tell her to get in on crypto currency.
&gt;&gt;2284832Cuck
Blah blah blah why aren&#039;t you getting blowjobs under the table from her yet?
&gt;&gt;2284394get rid of her ass. she&#039;s trying to leverage more money out of you.
&gt;&gt;2284795t. dwight schrute
Ask her if the job offer was genuine. Tell her you cannot match the salary they&#039;re offering, and that if she&#039;s planning on leaving for that position you need to know in advance.In regards to the punctuality: I run a three strikes and out policy. Take her to one side and talk to her calmly about your criticisms. If she takes it on board then great! If not, she has a more serious talk coming down the line, then after that one it&#039;s time to consider hiring a new employee.
&gt;&gt;2284394look if youre not getting some vagexchange then she&#039;s not worth the effort. Its easier to train someone to be good at something than it is to train someone to start working when theyre supposed to. ill take a mediocre worker who I can make good over a good worker who wastes my time every day of the week.t. she&#039;s costing you money and if no pusspuss its not worth it. She&#039;s not your gf
&gt;10 minutes lateWho fucking cares? You said it yourself they do good work
&gt;&gt;2284950&gt;&gt;2285043Depends on the office culture. Do you being meetings at 9am? If she&#039;s late for those then that&#039;s a concern. If not then does she stay slightly later or work harder which might make up for lose time?Additionally, I&#039;ve worked places where you lose your bonus for ongoing lateness, that&#039;s a good incentive if you do bonuses.
&gt;&gt;2285043He should.If she comes in late soon every employee will do the same or it will seem she is getting preferential treatment. A person like that can slowly fuck up an entire business
&gt;&gt;2285100JFC, excuse the glaring typos.
&gt;&gt;2284394Maybe you shouldn&#039;t have hired a fucking foreigner when you could support the American economy and hire an American. Hope she runs your company into the ground :)
Would u recommend me this book?Looks like its filled with obvious shit like invest in value.Any other book recommendations about investing or other /biz/ related things?

CLOAK just broke 100000 wall! Why aren&#039;t you investing in CLOAK?
Anons, I&#039;m looking to make some short-term gains. I go to coinmarketcap to see what coins are really moving, figuring I can ride them higher for a while. But some coins are making 100% gains for the week, but only 5% for the day, and are losing 10% for the hour. Others are jumping 100% that past hour, but are so-so for the day and the week. Which rise indicates a rising curve? Or should I look for the biggest DROP on the theory that it will go back up. Help me, Obi-/biz/, you&#039;re my only hope.
Find a tiny coin like RDD, the fewer sats the better. Zoom in as much as you can. Spot the trading range. Buy low sell high. If it escapes that range wait for it to stabilize and start again.
It&#039;s time50% up minimum by tomorrow, whales are accumulating
Go away cryptoyoda
&gt;&gt;2284331you know its true
Load up now, ETC under 0.007 is a steal.
&gt;&gt;2284322kill yourself bitcoin stalking horse
Sounds good opening up a 5x margin position made bank on this coin couple weeks ago or last week idk I forget
&gt;&gt;2284322Wtf would you invest in this shitcoin.&gt;b-b-bbut muh immutability!&gt;muh decentralized!!No one gives a fuck.
&gt;&gt;2284439Key word is invest faggot this coin made me a shit load of money last month
&gt;&gt;2284454Yeah and ETH went from $50 to $240 in the same amount of time. Just stick to investing in coins with good fundamentals.
im ready, and im screenshotting&gt;&gt;2284439to laugh at in a few days.
&gt;&gt;2284505lol stay poor faggot. If it goes up even slightly it&#039;s always because Ether is pumping.
&gt;&gt;2284531first ride ETH, then put it into ETC, then back into ETH
Im strapped in and fucking angry with all this bull bear whale manuplating shit. It better go to 30 dolliridoos.
&gt;&gt;2284439this is why
What to do with Siacoin?Sell it now or hold?
hold faggot
Hold. Always hold.
&gt;&gt;2284393I&#039;m holding this babySomeone post cute Siacoin memes
hold the price will be $3 in 5 weeks
&gt;&gt;2284412i dig our maskoti wish i had a twitter to shill this shit propperly
HODL FAGGOT!
it&#039;s literally mooning RIGHT NOW
&gt;&gt;2284413There is literally zero chance of that, it would have to become like 10x bigger than dropbox for that to happen..10-.15 is possible
Always hold, will moon this week for sure
HANDS OF TITANIUM BOYS
tfw eurofagtfw cant do this shit
&gt;&gt;2284393gonna wait til the digibyte spike on the 9th and then switch my gains from it onto sia
&gt;&gt;2284474why 9th
tearing through sell walls like they&#039;re nothing
&gt;&gt;2284479Developers are giving a presentation, marketing hype will happen and price will go up.But I&#039;m gonna sell after I think it&#039;s peaked.
&gt;&gt;2284479Major announcement about some Citi Bank competition.
pnd when wallet gets fixed
&gt;&gt;2284393Holding about 50k of them now. Read the site, looked into it, plus they actually charge money and compete with other companies like Amazon and Dropbox.Siacoin definitely has moon potential.
I have 50/50 on Sias and DigibyteSell Siacoin to buy DGB, hold to 9th june and after it buy Siacoin or hold everything?
&gt;&gt;2284393Hodl
&gt;&gt;2284393one guy just sold 20btc for 600on bittrex, going on 620 on polo
&gt;&gt;2284467ftw eurofag and doing this shit
&gt;&gt;2284393Hold, especially if you lose money by selling. There&#039;s plenty of growth potential with this one, be patient.
Do you really want /biz/ to hold your fucking hand? Is investing a little too hard for you? Can&#039;t think for yourself?What the fuck do you think /biz/ is going to tell you? Everyone&#039;s either going to tell you to &quot;HODL HODL WEAK HANDS&quot; or &quot;LOL SELL AND BUY _____ (MY BAGS) BECAUSE IT&#039;S GONNA MOON XD XD XD XD&quot;
&gt;&gt;2284467why?
&gt;&gt;2284393Hold for sure. Sia as a program is actually pretty tight, you guys should check it out. If they could make it more accessible, it could be pretty big for cheap+large data storage.
Anyone else notice they cant move this shit in poloniex? Feels like mt goy days.
&gt;&gt;2284886thankfully the dev team is already on it. they keep their subreddit updated pretty frequently.
&gt;&gt;2284886It&#039;s been on and off for a few days now. Not sure what the problem is
Why the fuck wouldn&#039;t you hold, this shit can moon so hard
&gt;&gt;2284690What&#039;s the point of /biz/ if not to tell me what makes me rich?&gt;/biz/ tells me about potential&gt;googlefu verifies it
&gt;&gt;2284988Tech not able to deal with recent massive growth, they&#039;re working on it
&gt;&gt;2284393&quot;SiaCoin is in negotiation with SAP for blockchain integration in MasterData Governance software&quot;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1060294.new#new
There have been whales keeping this price down all day, big things are about to happenBUY BUY BUY
&gt;&gt;2285032They didn&#039;t?https://mobile.twitter.com/SiaTechHQ
It&#039;s a medium to long term hold obviously.If you want to chase around pump and dump intraday gains, there&#039;s probably 5-15 DGB shitcoin threads for that purpose.Now leave.
&gt;&gt;2285039big if true
how can an open source project have such a high market cap?
&gt;you are new&gt;you are daytrading&gt;you don&#039;t research the coin you are buying&gt;you expect every new coin to surge in price&gt;you expect every ICO to make you money&gt;you expect massive gains every trade&gt;you expect every trade to be a success&gt;you don&#039;t know when to take a loss&gt;you don&#039;t have the patience to holdDon&#039;t let these gains spoil you my children. You are growing impatient and making irrational decisions.Feel free to add to my list
&gt;&gt;2283681&gt;you&#039;re using money you can&#039;t afford to lose
&gt;&gt;2283681You are blindly looking to others on /biz/ for advice
&gt;&gt;2283726&gt;not having a mutual fund so you can do coins with your spare dosh for fun and gains
&gt;you are buying in all at once in instead of gradually scaling into your position with smaller purchases
&gt;you make all of your decisions in a panic
&gt;&gt;2283681&gt;you still throw your hard earned dollarydoos on women instead of investing your cash in coins.
What&#039;s up with these twitter traders?Surely they must be multi-millionaires by now? Whats their end goal?The last thing I&#039;d want to do is ask for tips and spend 12 hours a day at my desk watching charts.
ahahahahahahaha believing anyone on youtube or twitter that claims their an expert trader is fuckin dumb.usually they have their own yt accounts or blogs where they collect ad money off of and they just slam that money in BTCthen they parrot what they see on major investment sites to make themselves seem smart
&gt;&gt;2284807Exactly, real anons know the only place to get REAL advice and get rich quick is /biz/
So, I have 65% in BTC, 20% in ETH and 15% in altcoinsI&#039;m not planning on selling anything for a year+ so I can get that sweet longterm investment tax breaks.So, these are my altcoin longterm hodls, is there anything here that is potential scam material? should I swap anything? any advice would be appreciatewhat&#039;s your longterm hodls
Get some Storj as well
ARKI&#039;d also get out of BTC (or hedge it with LTC), the scaling debate is far from settled and UASF goes live in Aug
I have 40% in Strat
&gt;&gt;2284843Drop GNT, get UBQ.
Is there really anyone around here with no coins?This is the financial opportunity of a lifetime and you are still not holding any coins?Are you younger than 18 and can&#039;t bit coin?What&#039;s your fucking excuse?
They&#039;re just at the point where they don&#039;t feel comfortable enough holding any coin. People gotta do their research first.
I lost 60% of my money folwing biz advice, xby, posw, pivxCrypto is all a scam you must be in it together to scam usI reported it to the authorities so dont worry your litle criminal racket will be shut down soon enough
I just started browsing this board yesterday and getting familiar with all this cryptocurrency thing
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;Betting on shitcoins
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;tfw got in at 100 sats dgb and 70 sats xvg thanks to /biz/dob heh
&gt;&gt;2282948Still doing the technical research, this thing is so big I don&#039;t even know half of the coins. Plus knowing what the best wallet exchange is really vague when searching
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;been intro crypto for 4 months&gt;never even seen those coinsGood job bro
&gt;&gt;2282948FUCKING BITTREX TAKING FOREVER TO CONFIRM MY DEPOSIT
&gt;&gt;2283027out of all shitcoins being shilled, you chose the top 3 shitcoins. You deserve this.
I bought into sia at 650, still bagholding. If it doesn&#039;t recover I&#039;m probably not continuing
&gt;&gt;2283099How much are you holding and what did you pay for it?
&gt;&gt;2283099lol fucking normie. Buy high sell low
&gt;be poorfag&gt;see biz meme on pol&gt;check place out&gt;told to invest in coin&gt;spend a few hours reading on crypto and setting myself up&gt;drop $100 on coin at a fairly decent time&gt;get $30&gt;drop another $100&gt;watching and clutching my heart watching these dips
&gt;&gt;228312511400 coins for 0.078btc, currently worth 0.063btc&gt;&gt;2283147I fell for /biz/&#039;s shilling, even though I knew it was wrong
&gt;&gt;2282948&gt;tfw started browsing this board a few months ago after Trump won and I started buying stocks&gt;3 weeks ago decide to stop being a nocoiner&gt;buy 1 eth @ $88&gt;mfw I thought it was too high at the time&gt;mfw I only bought one and don&#039;t want to buy any more now because I don&#039;t want to feel like a sucker who bought high
&gt;&gt;2283186&gt;tfw don&#039;t want to be a sucker who bought higher than I did
I put 20 dollars into bitcoin today. I&#039;ll probably forget about it by tomorrow when I have to go back to wageslaving. Maybe it&#039;ll mean something in 30 years.
&gt;&gt;2282948I was 16 back at 2009 when I discovered it ant BTC was below $50.I live in Israhell so they conscripted me to the military with no pay until about last year so I never got a chance to nail a good posotion in my life until after I was discharged.I hope bitcoin and my other holdings keep rallying higher so I could finally get some for the lost time at least...
&gt;&gt;2283186I probably bought ETH ATH,feels better than to be a nocoiner.
The following are my actual reasons:(1) PIMO, i.e., I am Pissed that I Missed Out. It&#039;s too late to get in now for any sizable gains (a paltry 2-10x vs 1000x), so it is &#039;not-worth-it&#039;/&#039;bullshit&#039;. Is there a phrase for such irrational thoughts?(2) I am of the Pajeets, and I can&#039;t into crypto without getting anally probed by my gubment. There are a few exchanges here, but they are low volume and require extensive documentation. Localbitcoins sellers want 20-30% over current rates.(3) I am an impressionable/gullible man-child who would probably be among the first to be bamboozled by you fine P&amp;D&#039;ers.
I don&#039;t know where to start or what a lot of terms mean but I only lurk a little so that&#039;s probably why.
&gt;&gt;2283262all shilling aside, if crypto becomes mainstream which is a very real possibility , btc could still go up 100x what it is nowwatch some talks by andreas antonopolous on youtube
&gt;&gt;2282948How do you distinguish between pump/dump scams and legit promising coins?
&gt;&gt;2283327That&#039;s the million dollar question.
&gt;&gt;2283262You will want to kill yourself again in a couple months when you missed out again. I&#039;ve gone from 3.5k to over 7k in about 10 days and that&#039;s with some bad trades.
&gt;&gt;2282948getting verified as we speak bros
&gt;&gt;2283327Do your research, Jesus
&gt;&gt;2282948I don&#039;t have any at the moment, but I don&#039;t have anyway to mine or buy theme, so I&#039;m fucked.
&gt;&gt;2283366Lol youre getting b&amp; dumbass
&gt;&gt;2283182&gt;&quot;I lost $20 my life is over this is a scam I&#039;m a victim&quot;I don&#039;t get this...I invested $2k less than a month ago and now I have $10k. I don&#039;t even think I bought anything until I had $1k BTC... whats the point of moving around beans and potatoes just to make $10.
&gt;&gt;22829482yung
Any chance to get into coining under 18?
&gt;&gt;2283464I think the same way. The difference is my 1000 dollars is your 10 dollars.My dudes. Open an FX account. Long USD/TRY... Rent an effing bank safe put some gold in it...
I started 1 1/2 weeks ago. Iv got invested $700. I have almost no clue what Im doing and my value is up to $750 so far. Im day trading with $50 and making small gains until I get the hang of everything. Most of my coin is ETH. Gonna hold ETH/BTC.
&gt;&gt;2283464&gt;&gt;&quot;I lost $20 my life is over this is a scam I&#039;m a victim&quot;I didn&#039;t say that, I just said I wasn&#039;t going to continue. If I can&#039;t make money on $200 (and in fact lose money), it&#039;d be pretty dumb for someone like me to invest thousands
I&#039;m still not sure if this is just a fraud/troll/pumpndumb. Why the fuck are you people so zealous about other people getting on on free cash? There&#039;s something not quite right about taking financial investment tips from an anonymous hentai image board. Why the fuck doesn&#039;t this board have a flag? So we can see how&#039;s from Pakistan, Indonesia or the Russian federation.Why the fuck wouldn&#039;t there be hordes of 3th world cyber scammers trying to capitalize on the autism and anonymity of this board?I&#039;m still lurking thought, but it seems so foolish to believe tips this board.
Only got about $150 worth of coins because poorfag/am lazy so haven&#039;t given much effort into trading. Should probably devote more time to it, but it can be pretty daunting at the start. Plus you have to learn to be ok with short term losses etc
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;I reported it to the authorities
&gt;&gt;2282948&gt;tfw every coin I&#039;ve bet on has moonedHave positions in ETH, DGB, GNT, WAVES, SJCX, XEM, IOC AND ARK and have turned a profit on all of themJesus hell it&#039;s not hard, buy shit that isn&#039;t a meme and HODLTbh, my only regret in investing so much in GNT for x2 profit when I could have made more by putting it into something else.
&gt;finally got into cryptos this week&gt;bought $2500 of btc and $2500 of eth&gt;no idea if this was a decent investment&gt;it doesn&#039;t matter since i&#039;m probably gonna an hero eventually anyway
&gt;&gt;2283824more people=more demand=everything goes up valuebut unless you are talking about small shitcoins, /biz/ is 0.000001% of a market
&gt;&gt;2282948I just don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing.I got a bitbargain account, and I can buy btc.But I&#039;d really rather just buy other cryptocurrencies and bypass bitcoin. Is that possible with GBP?tldr: Absolute noob, need help to get started.
&gt;&gt;2283027Protip, don&#039;t invest in any coin that /biz/ recommends for the sole reason that /biz/ recommends it. Sure, you may miss out on the next ETH or whatever, but at least you won&#039;t lose a shit-ton of money in shitcoins.Do your own research, look for coins that have a strong communities and dev support, invest in coins that perform some useful function, buy before hype, etc. Follow these tips and you can avoid looking like a goofball when the coin of the week flops.
&gt;&gt;2282948Can anyone tell me what&#039;s the best way to buy bitcoins in Canada?Kraken seems to be the cheapest but their verification process is taking forever. I&#039;m supposed to get verified today for tier 1 and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have to wait another 2 days for tier 2 to deposit some fiat and buy some BTC finally.FUCK, I want to get in on the DGB dip right fucking now.
&gt;&gt;2283947You&#039;re gonna make it pham
&gt;drop 100 last night&gt;+25 profit todayfollow the biz memes and youll be fine. only wish i invested more&gt;all my friends think free money isnt worth it
&gt;&gt;2283027Xby and PIVX? How the fuck did you lose money? Both of those fucking exploded?
&gt;&gt;2284300I&#039;ll never understand normies. I&#039;m just sitting on my ass and I&#039;m making thousands, and normies who work five jobs and attend university think investing in crypto is &quot;too much work&quot;.
&gt;&gt;2283947Can you send me your coins before you hero ?That would help me a lot since I&#039;ll probably be homeless in a few days :(BTC: 1K5kGyXNYam1WgvKf3ZGSBhcRBTqNhoQxNETH: 0xdc98cb19941f46fae3554b7123c9615e4f7b4cc3
any brits can tell me what sites they use
&gt;&gt;2284321&gt;i-i-its gambling youll lose your moneythey think you cant sell immediately the moment it bumps in price for profit
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;daytrading without researching&gt;not investing in strong ones and holdingI&#039;m brand fucking new to all of this but I&#039;ve made a 50% increase in 10 days. Come on
I&#039;m from a European country that can&#039;t buy/sell bitcoins on circle or coinbase. I guess I&#039;m doomed to being a no coiner.

&gt;&gt;228306470 on xvg is embarrasing and nothing to be proud of, it was at 38 for a week
&gt;&gt;2282948&gt;Are you younger than 18 and can&#039;t bit coin?Im fucking 16 and I have about 800 in cryptosNocoiners have no excuse
&gt;&gt;2284334Im sure he&#039;d rather throw it away before giving it to a mongol bull milking forum beggar
&gt;&gt;2283099&gt;I bought sia yesterday and im not rich yet wtfLol kys
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;I bought into the memes guise I fucking hate you!!11reminded me of this guy
&gt;&gt;2284543Isn&#039;t 100 sats DGB arguably also embarrassing? In retrospect I&#039;ve noticed that big guys called it at like 30 sats.Anyway, point of my post was just to make a humorous remark about /biz/&#039;s advice. I&#039;ve gone &gt;2500%+ thanks to /biz/ so I&#039;m a happy camper
&gt;&gt;2284570b&amp;
&gt;&gt;2282948Well if you like most people on this board can&#039;t/won&#039;t trade that means you&#039;ve got to become a HODLer. This means you need to take at least $50k of your hard earned money and put it in some shitcoins of your choice.Honestly if I didn&#039;t buy $100 worth of BTC in 2013 and trade it up I would probably be a no-coiner to. It takes most wagecucks years to save up $50k.
&gt;&gt;2284523Kraken nigger
I don&#039;t have any, waiting for when I can read higher volatility to jump in and cash some bucks outI&#039;ll consider to hold crypto in 5 yearsgold tokens way earlier
&gt;&gt;2283027&gt;loses 60% in a market that&#039;s quadrupled its marketcap in the past half year&gt;blames othersYour own fault dumbass.
i took out a line of credit to invest in cryto im going balls deep in this bitch
&gt;&gt;2285090same, I also sold a kidney
&gt;&gt;2282948Have been waiting 10 days for verification on kraken :(Would&#039;ve bought eth at 150 if I was approved day after I applied fucccckkkk
&gt;&gt;2283027How the fuck did you lose money on XBY and PIVX&gt;bought ath&gt;panic sold for loss on a dipI got in on those both pretty early.&gt;$0.40 is not early re: PIVX&gt;$0.009 is not early re: XBY
this fuckin place is giving me an ulcer. i just want to dump everything into ETH/BTC and not even look at my wallet for months.
Sorry anon gotta work to make money.Even if &#039;work&#039; is just reading coin memes until you want to throw up from anxiety.
It&#039;s like we&#039;re real Wall-Street people
&gt;&gt;2285012class act, lil doggo
I keep telling myself that we are early adopters like warren buffet back in the day and will be filthy rich once the mainstream public catches on.
&gt;&gt;2285012class act, lil doggo
&gt;&gt;2285055This is all I have keeping me going. Don&#039;t have a terrible wagie job but want my crypto freedom.
&gt;&gt;2285012class act, lil doggo
&gt;&gt;2284947do it faggot
&gt;&gt;2284947I wouldn&#039;t consider eth a safe long term hold, it&#039;s too complex and likely exploitable. Seems at more risk of an undesirable event than btc.
&gt;&gt;2285037but we&#039;re not though. at least i&#039;m not. at the end of the day i&#039;m just a dumb neet who faps to traps too much
I&#039;m still confused on if/how altcoin trades are reported. For normal stocks, you would report every trade (capital gains/losses). I know everything is still a gray area for crypto, but I couldn&#039;t find any solid answers about altcoin taxes.I think for sure if I buy and sell BITCOIN for USD, I have to report. But all the stuff in between when I&#039;m trading altcoins for BTC, do we have to report that? If so, how in the fucks?
No, its free. Says so in the constitution.
Bump. Want to know if the IRS is going to fuck me for being uneducated in this.
Nobody?
&gt;&gt;2284786Yeah, I&#039;ll tell you. But before I do, transfer some Bitcoin here first: 1MFkPGncP8neXirv6j8yVHGRq3UEQA4Mge
for the 500th time : we dont know and we dont care
&gt;&gt;2284810How does nobody know or care?? When your cashing in your money, it has to matter right?
&gt;&gt;2283567You will need to pay Capital Gains tax on profits only after you withdraw into usd. So you invest 240 usd into bitcoin you do some alt bets and get 1k back you pay capital gains tax on 760 bucks (1000-240)Fucking Faggot
&gt;&gt;2283567https://bitcoin.tax/
&gt;&gt;2284837We really dont know, the IRS doesn&#039;t know, nobody fucking knows. We have to wait and see. At the moment it looks like either you do it when you change back to USD or you have to record every single transaction you make and pay tax on any gains.
&gt;&gt;2284805I only have like .9 is that enough?
&gt;&gt;2284839This is my understanding as well. You dont have to worry about the alt trades just the trades between usd and btc
&gt;&gt;2284810oy vey nobody knows yet, it is a legal gray area, if there&#039;s no legislation by april 15th next year you&#039;re in the clear
&gt;&gt;2284837Most of us that aren&#039;t new have just completely accepted that giving the IRS your fiat exchanges is enough.Listing every single altcoin trade, especially when the only way to establish a fiat value for them is to go through BTC, is stupid.Just pay for the capital gains.
I thought this shit was all anonymous
&gt;&gt;2284899it stopped being anonymous when you gave coinbase your info
&gt;&gt;2284899Only when businesses start accepting bitcoin
&gt;&gt;2283567Why would I ever want to withdraw to USD when I could use BitPay right?I only have to report to the tax if I cash out right? Or else how would they know?
&gt;&gt;2284858That&#039;s fine.
&gt;&gt;2284925some people don&#039;t live in their parents fucking basements and have bills to pay to the modern world
&gt;&gt;2284899&gt;&gt;2284915And the rough part is that even though crypto addresses and such are anonymous, the blockchain is visible. If anyone really wants to figure out what you&#039;ve been doing they only need a starting point and then to follow the money.
&gt;&gt;2283688talk to a cpa/tax attorney specializing in cryptos. Dont ask on fucking biz. People here will either troll you or give you false info.
&gt;&gt;2284839&gt;&gt;2284869That&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard as well, but I never see any actual sources.&gt;&gt;2284856And this is even more obvious than the above &quot;facts&quot;. So I&#039;m really only confused because half the people say noone knows and the other half say to report USD capital gains.
&gt;&gt;2284962They don&#039;t know shit about crypto legislation either from what I&#039;ve gathered.
&gt;&gt;2284889This. There is no official ruling yet so just pay capital gains tax. Once you know this stop asking questions the more you ask the worst it will be for everyone.
&gt;&gt;2284983&gt;&gt;2284971Nobody does yet, that&#039;s what we&#039;re trying to tell you. There&#039;s even talk of having to pay this shit quarterly if you&#039;re above a certain bracket. On the safe side pay your USD at the end of the year. Some of us will be inevitably fucked someday.
&gt;&gt;2284983&gt;&gt;2285033They know more than a bunch of biz fucking neets. Plus if you have a professional take care of it for you if shit goes wrong their ass is on the line too.
Why haven&#039;t you bought Cloak yet? 5 million coins and a 12 million dollar market cap. It&#039;s like you don&#039;t want free money..Cloak offers anonymous encrypted payments that can&#039;t be traced. It also give 6% interest on all coins held every year. This shit is gonna be huge. Buy now or cry later than you missed another moon mission.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzlP69bwHkc
&gt;It also give 6% interest on all coins held every year.where does the money come from?
didn&#039;t it already quadruple earlier today? all the hot action always happens when i&#039;m asleep.
&gt;&gt;2284926whoa watch it buddy
&gt;&gt;2284926&gt;https://forum.cloakcoin.com/index.php?topic=9.01. 6% p.a. Example: you have 10000 CLOAK in your wallet, you will have 10600 CLOAK after 1 year.2. When you leave your wallet open you&#039;ll stake every now and then and get a portion of the 6% yearly interest each time you stake. Example: each time you stake you may get 0.5 - 1 Cloak3. Each wallet is an equal node! Cloak does not have masternodes! Everyone earns 6% staking interest and if ENIGMA is turned on 1.8% of each ENIGMA TX you helped.4. The amount of coins is not important. You&#039;ll get 6 % p.a. Example: 1000 Cloak earn you 60 10000 Cloak earn you 600. The more coins you have, the higher is your weight, the faster you&#039;ll stake.5. The mobile app does not stake right now. CloakTeam works on that.
XVG does everything CLOANK does but better. (e.g i2p and TOR integration)
&gt;&gt;2284926they dilute the value of everyones elses coins.it makes literally no difference its a retarded marketing gimmic
&gt;&gt;2284940Yeah it did and that&#039;s just the start. Volume is growing fast on bittrex and it wouldn&#039;t take a lot of money to get this thing to the moon considering how many coins there are. 120 million dollar market cap = $250 a coin. It&#039;s only $2.50 right now.
hahaha just checked the graph thats a huge ass fucking pump do u really expect people to buy in right now ROGL
&gt;&gt;2285005It&#039;s done so that people keep nodes online, get a better network.
Oh my god could you be more obvious.Nobody listen to this shit. They just ran a pump and dump and this post is just trying garner attention for buys. Nothing is real.
&gt;&gt;2284990Verge is a shitcoin that people only bought because it had a low sat count and they were trying to get on the next DGB. That piece of shit is set to crash any day now.
&gt;&gt;2285020The volume on bittrex has gone up by 300 btc since the dump. Keep laughing faggot. You&#039;ll be the one crying in a few weeks when this coin is trading above $40.
&gt;&gt;2285052If XVG is a p&amp;d at least it&#039;s not as obvious.Yours is just ... ugh come on.
&gt;&gt;2285049You sound like those faggots last year that said ETH is a scam. Fuck off. Look at the numbers and the tech.
&gt;&gt;2285087How is this an &quot;obvious&quot; pump and dump? It went to 140000 sat and then people took profits and it&#039;s at 100000 now. The volume has gone up 300 btc since then. You&#039;re talking out your ass.
bought 4000 VGX for 188... currently it is selling at 150-160 :(.Should I HODL, or sell it now and get more Ark and DGB?
Dump it, learn your lesson (buy low), and start again.Don&#039;t count on it mooning again any time soon.
You&#039;re an idiot. Get out of crypto immediately. You will lose money.If you decide to stay:Time your buys. Don&#039;t hop on a coin when it has just tripled in value.Time your sells. Don&#039;t sell at the first sign of a dip. Most coins end up recovering and climbing at some point. Wait for that. Make some money.Do some research. Buy early.&gt; guys i just bought the ath, should i sell the dip so i can buy another ath????
&gt;&gt;2284973Yup, selling it. Any tips on what I should invest in right now?
&gt;&gt;2285002I am new to Crypto. Of course I will not be a pro right away.Thank you for the tips though.
&gt;&gt;2285056buy XVG, is about to moon yo
&gt;&gt;2285056Buy high and sell low. This is the /biz/ motto. Learn from mistake and repeat it.
Hoping to earn something wile doing nothing :vthen invest it without puting my savings in risk.Any advice? (I almost dieded once)
I heard a rumor that Dan Bilzerian and his family just bought a epic amount of Ethereum!
Heard that rumor too WTFSELL SELL SELL
&gt;&gt;2285042&gt;buy the rumor, sell the news
&gt;&gt;2285017God that&#039;s a cringey picture.
A+ shitpost OP.However, If true, this is an obv sign we are still in the smart money phase. /s
&gt;&gt;2285048that&#039;s what (((they))) want you to do while (((they))) do the correct version
&gt;&gt;2285017not buying dgb, may all dgb holder gets dans hookers and lambos
abandon ship its sinking
&gt;&gt;2281093my biz bros would never sell were in this for the long haul we firmly believe in microsofts ability to integrate this into minecraft
&gt;&gt;2281093&gt;a currency that can only be traded with other currencies giving it no funcion at all&gt;only niche thing is the ability to mine through vidyayeah, no shit it&#039;s sinking, it&#039;s functionless
&gt;&gt;2281093&gt;Bought at 600satI&#039;m comfy, thanks.
Stay strong my digibros, don&#039;t sell!
guys stop selling
&gt;&gt;2281093weak hands gtfo. Hit 10 Cents within a month, gonna laught at all those weak hands. screencap this
It formed a double top. Shit is fucked.
&gt;&gt;2281093Hodl for life. But for real, when you sell you are missing mad gainz
&gt;&gt;2281146getting dumped hard, itll reach one cent before 10 cents
Hold or be mad in the end
&gt;&gt;2281093Oh i bet you&#039;re that myriad shill that constanty talks shit about DGBBe honest, how much would you have made if you havent sold?
i love it when the weak hand mcgees dump their coin when whales push the price down by adding in 0.003 or 0.004 orders lol.you guys fall for anything lmao, no wonder whales pinch all your money.
Too many people cashing out to buy used luxury cars. It will dip and the then spike again in a week or two.
&gt;&gt;2281175This, same shit as last week.
&gt;&gt;2281159&gt;FUD&gt;1$ per coin&gt;you will regret selling this&gt;don&#039;t be mad at the endSave the rest of your money and dump this memecoin. Maybe you even be able to afford 2008 Ford Focus instead of Lamborgini
I&#039;ll 5x my DGB if it ever hits 1500 again
&gt;2700% growth in a month&gt;drop by 25%&gt;HURR GOYS ITS FINISHD IS FALLING DOWNwat is correction? It wouldn&#039;t be able to sustain its growth without that dip, good for daytraders if they managed to get out at the ATH. I think there&#039;s support forming around 1700, it&#039;ll go sideways for a while and then jump up again, moon imminent if Friday goes well.Got mine at 100sat, not daytrading. I don&#039;t mind the dip.
&gt;&gt;2281093bouth at ATH xD kill me
&gt;&gt;2281261no u
&gt;&gt;2281261never buy at an ATH nigga, you have to follow the natural ecosystem of a crypto cycle.you wait til its dip after a huge increase in price, this is usually seen when theres huge sell orders, this is weak handers dumping their coins, daytraders panic selling.typically the big fish who observe the average price it maintains at strike, the whales come in and swallow up the stacks the baby daytraders and weak handers willingly give up and the price starts accumulating again.
&gt;&gt;2281283&gt;no u
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT INYOU TOLD ME WE WERE GOING TO 3000
&gt;&gt;2281157&gt;itll reach one cent before 10 centswhat did he mean by this?
&gt;sell now&gt;buy even more when it dips hard&gt;sell when it moons after 9thtell me why this won&#039;t work
&gt;&gt;2281348It will work. Cucks are selling their bags because a couple hundred sat dip after a 1500 sat gain is too much to bear
&gt;&gt;2281333now it&#039;s around 4.5centsit&#039;ll go down to one cent, and then rebounce back surpassing its old ATH up to 10 cents.are you fucking retarded dude?
&gt;&gt;2281093Kill yourself fudder&gt;bought at 115 sats
Thank lil baby Jesus that it dipped. I sold at 2500 after buying in at 600. Hoping it&#039;d go down this low.
&gt;&gt;2281348My exact strategy. At this point I just hope everyone gets weak hands and the fucking thing sinks to 800sat or something.
&gt;&gt;2281328Anyone who tells you where the price of a coin will reach is a raging faggot.
&gt;&gt;2281364&gt;getting this madcrypto has this board on the edge all the time
Wow you posted this thread last night when it was &quot;sinking&quot; too didn&#039;t you?It&#039;s getting old you newfags.
It&#039;s bouncing. Gainz sooner than later ladies. Stock up.
&gt;&gt;2281451soooo i buy moar nao yes?
Not buying Augur (rep) right nowbiz pls..
same thing every fucking week :the thread
&gt;&gt;2281471nah mate we&#039;r going outa the milkyway
People are just profit taking, a coin with the market cap of DGB should never be a top coin on volume9th and 10th of June at Citi is when shit gets real, expect 5k-6k prior and we&#039;ll be above 10c if all goes well afterwards
If it crashes below 1400 I&#039;ll throw my self off of my commieblock.
&gt;&gt;2281101Microsoft isn&#039;t integrating this into minecraft... Where do you people get this shit?DGB Devs are opening a single minecraft server where they&#039;re paying players. That&#039;s literally it.Once it launches and people realize they didn&#039;t do any research on this meme then it&#039;s going to plummet hard.That said, I&#039;m holding mine until then while more retards like you fomo.
&gt;&gt;2281093can someone post the dgb JUST dude
&gt;&gt;2281773
&gt;tfw bought at 1300 and sold at 1700
bought some at 1696, did i do good?
&gt;&gt;2281837nah it was the dgb mascot with the JUST hairsurely someone here has it
H00000001D
&gt;All those mad nocoiners when june 9 arrives and literally blasts us holders into pluto
&gt;&gt;2281876What, did you just sell now?You really think it&#039;s just going to die off after this? Get real. Why not sell at the peak since you were surely expecting it to crash?&gt;&gt;2281885Maybe, maybe not. I expect more of a dip but either way it won&#039;t matter compared to the gains that have yet to come.
&gt;&gt;2281918i&#039;ll buy more when it goes below 1400
&gt;&gt;2281907&gt;I&#039;m so confident that my memecoin will win City tech contest for no particular reason
&gt;&gt;2281907what happens june 9th?
&gt;&gt;2281940Good goy, at least you&#039;re taking risks.&gt;&gt;2281942Nobody is betting on that to increase the price newfag.
&gt;&gt;2281945feel free to google &quot;june 9th digibyte&quot; at any time anon
&gt;&gt;2281945Traditional changing of the bag holders ceremony
&gt;&gt;2281761When your average gamer gets a whiff that MICROSOFT is PAYING them to PLAY VIDEO GAMES this thing is going to explode.Big picture you autist.
&gt;&gt;2281942&gt;Its literally the only coin right now that actually has the chance to become the biggest shit next to the top dogsHard to mathematic right.Whether they do good or bad or whatever happens. June 9 is where this coin is the biggest. And depending on what happens, it could go very well higher.
&gt;&gt;2281191Yep. Sunday traders....
&gt;&gt;2281945The day you line up your new cars
June 22nd
&gt;&gt;2281160myriad doing pretty well at the moment. and it turns out everything that guy says is true.
&gt;&gt;2281093Its sunday and obviously must correct after a drastic moon phase like this. It&#039;s healthy, but uncomfortable
&gt;&gt;2282079FUCK YOU, WE&#039;RE ALL GONNA LOSE OUR MONEY AND DIIIIE. GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER.
&gt;&gt;2281988what is on june 9th?
I&#039;ll tell you guys a nice story. I never even cared about or liked dgb. Then one day, like a month ago, some anon made a thread saying he&#039;d give 10,000 dgb to first person who got trips. The winning anon was,me, and op surely did deliver. Granted dgb at that time was sitting at like 250 or 300, but because of that generous anon and how dgb has mooned since, I now have sworn loyalty and made an oath to never ever sell it regardless of what happens. I will serve and protect dgb for the rest of my days
i think the rally is slowly starting right now. back to 2000 within 4 hours, i guess, then if hype maintains up to 2500 and perhaps push past that 24 hr high.
&gt;&gt;2281093Hands off my dgb
&gt;&gt;2282093There is a Citibank presentation the 9th and a minecraft server launch at 10th.For reference:http://www.techforintegritychallenge.com/https://www.minethatdigi.com/
Check out the vol. market caps.

So having you money locked up in coins who&#039;s value continues to go up is great and all but what is your exit strategy? It&#039;s not like these coins are paying dividends or you can live off of them like you can with certain stocks.So when you finally say &quot;ok now I want my money back&quot;? What metrics do you use to measure how close you are getting to that point?
&gt;&gt;2283673&gt;bump 4 interest
Once you have &gt; 1 mil, take out 100k per year to live on, and let the rest ride. Obviously.
&gt;&gt;2283673when I&#039;m buying something that&#039;s like 2k plus, I will sell some coins for btc, send btc to coinbase, then sell btc and have money deposited to my bank account.If I&#039;m going out for a night and want like $500 I&#039;ll hit a btc atm and just pay the 10% fee plus 5% exchange rate bs.
&gt;&gt;2283749And how do you report that to the IRS
&gt;&gt;2283673&gt;So when you finally say &quot;ok now I want my money back&quot;?the plan is to hold until we&#039;re using crypto instead of fiatimo no point cashing out until you have enough that you can never work again
&gt;&gt;2283673there are so many uninformed virgin faggot chicken tendies eating niggers on this forum I feel like I&#039;m on 4chan...oh..

&gt;&gt;2283673&gt;grow my $50k in crypto to $5 million (should happen by the end of the year easily)&gt;take out $1.5 million&gt;begrudgingly pay the tax man&gt;buy a $1 million apartment in new york city&gt;have $50 million in crypto by the end of next year&gt;take out another million to buy a country house and build a runway&gt;take out half a million to buy a small private plane&gt;learn to fly&gt;spend the rest of my days flying around the country for fun
&gt;&gt;2284024&gt;what&#039;s your take on what to invest and why?
&gt;&gt;2284024&gt;mfw normies buy lottery tickets so they can dream about &#039;making it&#039; even though their odds are hundreds of millions to one&gt;mfw if they had just put that money into crypto they would have made it guaranteed
&gt;&gt;2283734You&#039;ll probably live more than 10 years after you reach 1 mil, what then?&gt;&gt;2284024Maintanance costs will kill you when bear market comes.
&gt;&gt;2283775as capital gains, how else would I report it?
&gt;&gt;2284052and yet normies think &quot;at least i got a chance with lottery tickets&quot;
&gt;&gt;2284024&gt;things that if posted in another board would be completely unbelievable but since its on biz and about shitcoins its probably true
&gt;&gt;2283673Take out only as little as you need. Fiat currency is losing its value, the central banks are losing control of the economies and the currency they issue. Cryptocurrencies may be a leading indicator for hyperinflation. Gold and silver usually are but the prices have been suppressed with paper derivatives.If you pull money out make sure you buy hard assets
BURST assets like burstocean pay great dividends
&gt;&gt;2283673When the global recession hits people will be looking for an exit strategy... not from crypto but away from fiat. Going into crypto IS the exit strategy.
&gt;&gt;2284146This guy fucks
&gt;&gt;2283922how much dice is that?
for any third worlder with no income tax&gt;localbitcoin.comfor americans, just make enough to move to a good 2nd world country with no income tax.
&gt;&gt;2284152&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/
&gt;Whats the exit strat?Crypto is the exit strategy bro.What part of inflation dont u understand?&gt;&gt;2283859&gt;&gt;2284146These guys get it
&gt;&gt;2284146&gt;&gt;2284198Yeah but when do you think this level inflation will hit that people will need to make the shift? In the meantime I need to continue being a wageslave for these stupid student loans. It&#039;s aweful.
&gt;&gt;2284205in the next recessionjust 5 years ago no one used the itnernet for elections and with trump we memeed one into office.
&gt;&gt;2284205&gt;In the meantime I need to continue being a wageslave for these stupid student loans. It&#039;s aweful.I know that feel dudeHang in there, hold your cryptos and when the storm passes we will live like kings
&gt;&gt;2284057&gt;You&#039;ll probably live more than 10 years after you reach 1 mil, what then?He said let it ride numbnuts. The return on crypto is easily enough to live off of the interest of $900,000 your whole life.
&gt;&gt;2284205When crypto reaches 500 billion market cap things will probably go parabolic insane.Hope you have invested an amount in decent crypto, not only memecoins.
&gt;&gt;2284251you could live off 1% intrest if you had that much. so just throw 10% of your coins into poloniex lending and you are good
&gt;&gt;2284224&gt;just 5 years ago no one used the itnernet for elections and with trump we memeed one into office.What about milions of Americans that doesn&#039;t know what 4chan is and were simply fed up with democrats bullshit? Ever though about them?&gt;&gt;2284251&gt;He said let it ride numbnuts.Shit right, my bad.&gt;The return on crypto is easily enough to live off of the interest of $900,000 your whole life.What makes you think it will stay that way? What would you do if bull market ends?
&gt;&gt;2284287&gt;What would you do if bull market ends?if it truly ends for decades i would kms
&gt;&gt;2283673im going to be dumb and give an honest answeri have no ideai put five grand in ETH months ago and now it&#039;s 30000 grand. that&#039;s not a life changing amount of money for me but it could pay off a chunk of my mortgage, a new car, a nice long vacation, five years of ROTH contributionswhen i put that money in, i let it go, i assummed it was lost, there was one week where it micro crashed and my resolve wavered, but i held (hodled) and here i am with 600% gains in 3 monthsso to answer your question, if ETH really is as important as people think it could possibly be, there is no logical reason to ever sell the ETH, it should be a lifetime investment, barring some GOX level calamityso i have no exit strategy, holding for life. maybe it&#039;ll make me a millionaire, maybe i&#039;ll lose it all, in my heart it&#039;s the same
&gt;&gt;2284262&gt;have invested an amount in decent crypto, not only memecoins.I can&#039;t afford much so I got:ETH (my main investment)BTC (just a little)SiaRippleDigibyteI bought a few on a whim but I&#039;m going to start doing a little more research into other altcoins with solid business plans &amp; products.
&gt;&gt;2283723Also bumping for interest.
&gt;&gt;2284365This is my current portfolio.The remaining money is in eth ~ 7k.Im really bullish about RLC and UBQ.Also, meme coins can give you exponential results in short time. I personally dont like investing in them.
&gt;&gt;2283673When I hit $1mil I will take a quater out and buy some property.
Will any of you pull out Cypto and put it into traditional stocks?
&gt;&gt;2284520lmao no
&gt;&gt;2284520Obviously.
&gt;&gt;2284520probably not me. it would require learning a whole new game, and once the crypto run is over -- assuming it goes anything like we&#039;re hoping -- im eager to move on, not spend my days watching a different set of markets.
&gt;&gt;2284024I&#039;ve got 50k to invest. Are you doing low sat high volume coin trading?
&gt;&gt;2284779holding should be enough for 10x
&gt;&gt;2283673&gt;cashing outGame plan is: this IS the new cash.Good money drives out bad.
&gt;&gt;2284287&gt;What would you do if bull market ends?By the time this happens I&#039;ll probably have at least $1mil principle if not more and I can coast by on stocks.
if I suddenly had enough money to buy a house tomorrow, I&#039;d take it all out through kraken and say fuck the banks and not get a loan.But that&#039;s not going to happen.I will have to get a loan, and probably I&#039;d make more money with crypto gains than by paying the loan more quickly anyways. I&#039;ll keep as much as I can in crypto, until I can use it.&gt; It&#039;s not like these coins are paying dividendSome do, but I understand your point. Once you sell, you ate your cake.
&gt;&gt;2284205Its already hitting in a few countries, why do you think Venezuelans are going into crypto so hard?
&gt;&gt;2284792Word, less capital gains tax that way, long term holdings instead of short.
putin met our guyhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/suddenly-vladimir-putin-meets-vitalik-buterin-endorses-ethereum
Fucking Russian hackers.
he endorsed it because it&#039;s hackable
&gt;&gt;2284879This is good. This will drive the normies away from it while we have time to accumulate. Muh russia
&gt;&gt;2284879Just wait until Congress uses this to tie Buterin into the &quot;muh Russian hackers&quot; pseudo-scandal and shut down crypto. Fuckers.
Relax everyone, according to the report, they only had a small talk, basically exchanged a couple of phrases
Not to mention Vitalik literally just said they have the ability to delete your coins any time they want.But people don&#039;t care they will still support ETH like they support Dash and other scams as long as they make a couple dollars.
&gt;&gt;2284907Lol there&#039;s a good possibility in this being not so far off

What do you guys think? Plan on putting in another 3000 by next month, half spread across some other alt coins like waves and ark, other half into eth. Then sitting, and holding like a mother fucker
&gt;&gt;2284706The later you get in, the more likely it is that this bubble pops.
&gt;&gt;2284715I realize that, but I already put in everything I can at the moment
&gt;&gt;2284706Too much of your portfolio is in small alts. Like 80-90 percent of your portfolio should be in big boys like bitcoin and ethereum. You have almost 25% in sia and dgb lmao.
&gt;&gt;2284897lol

Is smashing a prostitute worth it?Does any prostitute take crypto?
lots do. just go to vegas or something
This question has been posted before. And it&#039;s still a critical question.I&#039;ve thought about it 1,000 times but never pulled the trigger. For me, getting my dick hard is also about the girl being into me and wanting my jizz.Also I have heard guys say that after you cum, and the girl just grabs the cash and leaves as fast as possible, that it&#039;s a shitty feeling.
&gt;&gt;2276825LGD
&gt;&gt;2276855WHOISTHISSEMENDEMON
&gt;&gt;2276831&gt;lots do. just go to vegas or somethingbullshit. I live in vegas. no such thing as btc-whore service here yet.
In countries where it&#039;s legal, they don&#039;t usually run as soon as you cum and actually treat you well. Some do accept bitcoins, you can just text them to ask.
&gt;&gt;2276940this. in a brothel they&#039;re working on commission. they want customers coming back
&gt;&gt;2276825I am not banging a prostitute even if I have to die a virgin; I don&#039;t know why but I find the idea disgusting. Maybe I am too proud but I have to be in love in order to do the deed.
&gt;&gt;2277037lmao this is hilarious
&gt;&gt;2277037IKTF
&gt;&gt;2276825Depends on the country. As someone who has smashed many prostitutes across the globe, this has been my experience. It&#039;s not worth it if you&#039;re in:&gt;USA&gt;Canada&gt;Any Western European country where prostitution is illegal&gt;Northern EuropeIt is worth it (assuming you are attracted to the indigenous women) if you&#039;re in:&gt;Any South/Central American country&gt;Mexico&gt;Eastern Europe&gt;Western European countries where prostitution is legal&gt;The Carribean&gt;Any SE Asian country&gt;AfricaI don&#039;t really know about anywhere else.
&gt;&gt;2277056eh, let&#039;s be honest: hentai faphero plus a good onahole is a far better experience anyway
&gt;&gt;2277088how many countries have you been to?
&gt;&gt;2277037&gt;I have to be in love in order to do the deed
Have a wank, treat yourself to a fancy meal, and enjoy the $400 you still have left over
&gt;&gt;2276825I had a friend who did. It really seemed to help him. He was a 22 year old virgin. After that, he&#039;s consistently had girlfriends. For some guy they need to get over that initial nervousness to feel comfortable. Right like lose it to someone they don&#039;t care about or know, rather than a potential mate.Overall, I can&#039;t see anything wrong with it.&gt;Do they take crypto?Try cash, idiot.
&gt;&gt;2276825if you have the money to blow sure i guessi feel like i wasted my money when i&#039;ve done it
&gt;&gt;2276825There&#039;s a big escort agency in the US that takes bitcoin as payment. They also happen to have some of the best looking girls and the most reasonable prices. They&#039;re basically all top tier russian models who tour here and bring home what to them seems like a lot of money. Pic related.
&gt;&gt;2276825yesMake sure you get a fine and young ones that won&#039;t give you HIV and AIDS. Many cute and hot girls in south asia like Taiwaland and Phillipine.
&gt;&gt;2277106&gt;enjoy the $400I&#039;d rather enjoy my 1.7 ETH
&gt;&gt;2276825like they would know how to cash that shit&#039;hey sugar tits, do you take bitcoin?&#039;
&gt;&gt;2276825u guys are fuckng losersget a girl whos down for 1 month. 1 fucking month ull realize its way more efficient and better to just jerk it and move on with ur lifei feel sorry for any noob still fixated on getting some, like itll shore up ur pathetic self esteem
&gt;&gt;2277229What&#039;s inefficient about hookers? You show up, pay them, fuck for an hour or two, and then you never have to talk to them again.
&gt;&gt;2276825It will be hilarious to see hookers getting tattoos of their public key in a few years
&gt;&gt;2277037How do you know that you need to be in love? Maybe you can&#039;t do it even if you are in love.&gt;&gt;2277229&gt;&gt;2277244I hear celebs and busy people like them because they don&#039;t have to deal with the flirting and the hem/haw/maybe/no that comes with a normal relationship. They apparently want to smash and keep moving. For a hardcore crypto trader, I can see that being the case. Shit, I just want to stare at charts all day.
&gt;&gt;2276825about to find out!!!
&gt;&gt;2278378ur beautiful
&gt;&gt;2278378srsly brah? http://aliencathouse.com/elizabeth-bentley.htmlthere&#039;s way hotter chicks there
&gt;&gt;2277088Yeah but if you smash in mexico or other places aids might seep through the condom ( sometimes and or alot of times diseases can slip through
&gt;&gt;2276825Moving to Indonesia or the Philippines is the thinking /biz/nessman&#039;s move. Cheap pussy and rent. Perfect if you have a job you can do from anywhere; I&#039;m going into shipping but still in school.
&gt;&gt;2278448You think any proper escort would accept beancoin?
&gt;&gt;2276914Sounds to me like you have found a niche in the market.
&gt;&gt;2277037I agree. I find whores disgusting.Then again. I had several chances banging non whore girls but always refused (even some underage, 16 and 14)My problem is that I want that 10/10 girl.But I never found one. I get super bored of girls. I cant feel any attraction towards girls sub 9.&gt;Even had one bitch tell me via snapchat I should rape her
&gt;&gt;2276825Lost my virginity to an escort when I was 21. I&#039;m not normally someone to do something like that. My attitude was like this guy:&gt;&gt;2277037But I did nofap for a bit and my personality was temporarily altered.&gt;Fuck this, I ain&#039;t going another year as a virgin.&gt;Find non-niggre backpage escort. (Probably not a good place to go looking for this. I just got lucky and found one that actually looks like her picture)&gt;Call her and she tells me where the hotel room is.&gt;Nervous as I&#039;m walking down the hallway. Feeling shady.&gt;Knock on the door&gt;Young, hot topless girl opens the door.&gt;She smiles and hugs me like she knows me.&gt;Leave $200 &quot;donation&quot; on counter.&gt;Chat for a few minutes /watch TV&gt;&quot;Well get comfortable&quot;&gt;Get naked&gt;Starts doing magical twirly things with tongue&gt;HO LEE FUUAAAAARK&gt;Tell her I&#039;m a virgin&gt;We go through various positions and she teaches me the ropes&gt;Gives me another hug at the end and tells me to have a good night.&gt;Now if I die, at least technically I&#039;m not a virgin.&gt;Go home and sleep like baby.Don&#039;t regret it. Worth.
&gt;&gt;2277229this, pump and dump &#039;em faster than a shit coin anons. AWALT, focus on yourself
&gt;&gt;2277037You&#039;re putting the pussy on pedistal, you don&#039;t have to whore yourself out but it&#039;s better to be getting side pussy than not.
If a man has $150Does it go to pussy or beans?
&gt;&gt;2276855Depends on the escort.I&#039;ve been with 15 and I could say I only really enjoyed being with 3 of them. But all of them were around 19-22 and I was 21 at the time, it was kinda like hooking up with a girl my own age and they at least some what enjoyed it or orgasmed themselves.the vast majority were average lays and 1-3 were bad experiences. If you can find one that you vibe with well and she gives you a really good time its worth seeing them again imo.But getting it for free with a girl who really likes you is much better but not everyone has the luxury of always having girls into them.
&gt;&gt;2279072Beaner pussy.
&gt;&gt;2279296Well, I am in LA...
As someone whos fucked many whores.The absolute lowest I go is $500and i usually fuck $1200 pornstars. i raw dogged luci cline in vegas. Such a great deal
&gt;&gt;2276855Jesus, what&#039;s wrong with her?
&gt;&gt;2280128So what did you pay for a &quot;private porno&quot;
&gt;want to bang whore&gt;masturbate&gt;saved myself 200$I&#039;m slowly getting rich guys
WhoreCoin = a coin for transacting with whores. This could be the next big thing someone fucking do it NOW.
Lost my virginity to a prostitute a few weeks ago. I was sick of being a virgin and extremely introverted. The experience was not great, but I am much more comfortable with myself now that I don&#039;t have anxiety about being a virgin. In the future I will get a girlfriend or jack off. Not worth the money IMO.
&gt;&gt;2278493You can&#039;t fuck hot girls unless you are Chad.Coping with escorts is the only way out for sub8s, so buy 21 bitcoins, hold, and fuck 1000000 10/10 escorts in your mansion in 2030.
&gt;&gt;2278493Also girl in your pic is an 8.You are an autist that thinks hes Chad when you are a 6.
&gt;&gt;2276825go to a rub n tug. get a decent massage for $60/hr, and if you want a little extra after the massage, its $40 for a hand jibber. it&#039;s great to have a little azn cutie oil up your junk and tug one out.

&gt;&gt;2282059nothing cringe about it newfag
just get a grindr and get your dick sucked and your seed swallowed by a trans or fem boy for free. They just want yo be used.
&gt;&gt;2281811I never said im chad. Im a straight six on a good day however
&gt;&gt;2277229No, I understand what you mean since I always thought like that as well, but I (most people) need a gurl around from time to time.For example: if I don&#039;t bang for two weeks or so, I get extremely sexually frustrated, fapping aint gonna solve that.&gt;&gt;2278358&gt;Shit, I just want to stare at charts all day.Met too anon &lt;3&gt;&gt;2278635YES, MY MAN! The no fap method! I am currently trying to do that to order a tranny I found on Tinder. Wanna try that shit out, never banged a tranny before.&gt;&gt;2279074Can you elaborate about your bad experiences? Or just one.
&gt;&gt;2277037Not at all man, you&#039;re just a faggot
&gt;&gt;2282272hmm. are there any convincing traps on there
&gt;&gt;2277037Hahaha
Shit, I didn&#039;t realize /biz/ had so many virgins.Goodluck anons, I hope one day you earn enough from crypto for women to overlook your assburgers and aura of general beta cuckery.
&gt;&gt;2282059What&#039;s wrong with you? He&#039;s relating his experience.
&gt;&gt;2282337Bonus points if you can find a tranny with long ball sacks (due to prolonged tucking ya know). The sensation of her balls banging your balls when you do doggy from behind... my lord
Service Coin (SRV):Smart contract based, you connect to your clients phone via bluetooth and agree for a time limit (e.g. one hour) where you must remain in their vicinity. The contract is executed after a phone confirmation and the time is elapsed of the phones being bluetooth connected.
&gt;&gt;2277037You are not alone
&gt;&gt;2284051Hahahahha that actually sounds cool.
Paying for favors isnt worth it unless theres a particular fantasy you have that you cant convince someone to do. Iv hired 1 whore and paid extra for a handy from a massage place. Immediatley after both times I though &quot;I just paid X amount for a whole 10 minutes of joy. buy coin instead.
&gt;&gt;2276855&gt;&gt;2279074&gt;But getting it for free with a girl who really likes you is much better but not everyone has the luxury of always having girls into them.I have to disagree. Getting it with a smoking hot girl who likes you/wants your jizz is always of course the best, but most girls I can easily fuck are just regular girls, not model types. Regular girls were fine in my teens/early 20s, but I&#039;ve been ruined by a life time of internet porn and now I just want to fuck smoking hot sluts.Smoking hot sluts take time to court and have expensive life styles to maintain so they only go for ultra rich guys. Therefore I just pay to fuck them and I save money in the long run, and I can immediately return to watching charts and banking off crypto after I cum.10/10 plan to fuck 10/10 girls. When DGB hits 50 cents in a few weeks I&#039;m going to pull out some cash to fuck some porn stars I&#039;ve jacked off hundreds of times to.
&gt;&gt;2284562living the fucking dream anon
&gt;&gt;2278493&gt;&gt;2277037SAD
&gt;&gt;2277037Wait &#039;til you get older and life beats you down into a mush.
&gt;&gt;2278448http://aliencathouse.com/curvy-quinn.htmlI&#039;d smash this one
Get on the rocket.
&gt;&gt;2284714It&#039;s not nice to insult Dogecoin.
&gt;&gt;2284714Dumping my beans because of this. Never intended to invest my family into a pro-bully community.
&gt;tfw holding beans and dogos just because they are funny
Somebody explain to me why bitbean is mooningI now have 3k worth of beans
How much they at?
&gt;&gt;2284851Because we water and care for them.Treat your beans well, and they will grow.
Which coins do you have on your list?Coins that are just air and will crash and burn fast leaving normies behind holding bags forever.Top 5 only!For me that is:1 - Reddcoin (RDD)- Started 2014 but has still not delivered on its promises of social media fund platform. Actually delivered on nothing yet :)-Gets pumped/dumped clearly.- Price should be sat 5 max now hoovers around 150 sat.2 - XtraBYtes (XBY)Do I even need to explain why this is a scam coin? Never delivered anything just promises more and new tech when deadline of earlier promise has expired.Should be sat -13 - Verge (XVG)I do not think this is a scam. But believe it is just nothing special/new. They do nothing better than all other coins out there. Therefore very overrated now at sat 180.- Also gets pumped/dumped.- Should be priced at sat 10 max4 - MoneroNot a scam, just a board (founder) that is so amateuristic that you are just waiting for them to shoot itself in the foot (again). Also the product is outdated with ZCash taking the lead in &quot;privacy coins&quot; .. This coin will not make it to winter at sat 0.016 but will drop to &lt; 0.00015 - And now the big surprise Basic Attention Token (BAT).This coin has f up. Had great potential but the ICO spread a death seed in it.This coin will easily go to 20.000 sat but at one moment will crash and burn to below 1500 sat.Just to much whales in this coin who will start a dump race to the bottom. Also other will copy them without the browser function but just the webbrouwser pluggin.Shame, so close .. :)So those are my 5 coins to avoid (at least on the long run).What is your top 5 ?
&gt;&gt;2282436I&#039;m just glad that I&#039;ve been able to buy a bunch of a coin I likeIt&#039;s taking spots on the market cap list, but nobody talks about it, not yet.It will probably be in poloniex soon, and then I&#039;ll have made a lot of money already.
good list opreddcoin really did start out as a pump and dump here, i was here for ityoure right about verge, the market is starting to get saturated with clone coinsnot intrested in BAT, its not going to pay off like an ico such as Stratis; markets dont repeat themselves when you expect it. just buy stratis if you consider bat.
inb4 emotionally invested XBY bagholders
&gt;&gt;2282473IOTA?
&gt;&gt;2282628Thanks.Can you pls explain why stratis is the new ETH? I aint buying that yet ...Also please add your top 5 ranking of C&amp;B coins ..
BTCsearch your heart. you know it to be true.
&gt;&gt;2282710its just eth in c#some businesses prefer c#and it was released early enough tonhave staying power in this marketliterally no reason to expect it to fail imo, its the only coin i dont pay attention to the dips on
RDD, ETC, XBY, STEEM, GAME
&gt;Do I even need to explain why this is a scam coin? Never delivered anything just promises more and new tech when deadline of earlier promise has expired.There was no deadline of promises for XBY. I&#039;ll be laughing at you when its 5k sats +
&gt;&gt;2282803Sure people also get rich in pyramid schemes ..Just make sure you are rich and get out in time before it all comes falling down ..I hope you get rich.
&gt;&gt;2282436&gt;POS african children W&gt;XBY&gt;also RDD this thing is truly pure airThose are my shitcoin list, you can trade RDD relatively safe just having in mind is a shitcoin. The others are a no go.
&gt;&gt;2282857&gt;&gt;2282869Screencapped. I&#039;m adding this to my XBY moon collage.And with your logic every coin is a pyramid scheme.
&gt;&gt;2282795Yep Steem, and what is up with their twitter account??? All those irrelevant food and vacation picture posts :)
I gotta add XBY to my meme
&gt;&gt;2282898No it is not, guz coins can actually bring in value other than alone create it with their pyramid structure.Just an example, Ripple brings value to their coin XRP by making something that is used in real life (transactions) faster/cheaper. Not saying you should buy XRP btw :) Wanting that coin could be therefore based on the value upside related to that coin in stead of wanting the coin without good reason because you can get other behind you who pay for your profits ... Clear?
&gt;&gt;2282941digibyte I forgot that one :)
&gt;&gt;2282950Your gibberish just proves you&#039;re a fudder and this is your &quot;LIST OF COINS I ALREADY SOLD AND WANT TO BUY ON A DIP&quot;Every coin is a pyramid scheme. &quot;Value&quot; is completely subjective and entirely based on perception. MAID safe has a $100k+ marketcap and yet the tech does not fully exist yet. Crypto markets are based on speculation.
&gt;Your gibberish just proves you&#039;re a fudder and this is your &quot;LIST OF COINS I ALREADY SOLD AND WANT TO BUY ON A DIP&quot;kek. This.and OP sounds like a moron
&gt;&gt;2282436NEM.Their website is trash and poorly coded and riddled with spelling mistakes.There entire product description is just a bunch of vague shit like &quot;New type of spam prevention&quot; and they never actually explain what that even means.They have a lot of claims on their website without a shred of actual prototype proof to back it up.
&gt;&gt;2283039Haha nice. You tried to read me.Also No not all coins always are a 100% pyramid scams (just a part of it with the coins that actually bring something to the table). The fact that value is subjective (even not always entirely true) would not change that. just think about it.
&gt;&gt;2283068Yes I am a moron. I am on 4chan discussing with all Anonym about Ccurrency.That said even a moron can see that the coins listed are overrated .. You cannot. :)Not trying to insult you btw
&gt;&gt;2283252I don&#039;t see how a new means of advertising that has been developed removing the middleman between publishers,advertisers and consumers, partnered with an upcoming browser to compete with ad-sense.. is ...overrated.
&gt;&gt;2283292true that is not it at all ..You will see other parties coming doing the same but with more support/people owning the coin and not as browser just as a plugin. Also overrated depends on price. Anything can be overrated depending on the price .. even something really good ..
&gt;&gt;2282436&gt;&gt;2282436nice list. so what are your top good coins, op?
No one mentioned DGB so far?&gt;top kek
&gt;&gt;2282436&gt;MoneroI agree, doomed by the idiots working on it and their fake ideals&gt;XVGI do not agree, it&#039;s a decent alternative to monero and so far we haven&#039;t seen any retards doing dumb shit on their behalf&gt;XBYhard to tell, they have constant updates on their work, it has decent concepts and ideas behind it. Original dev seems capable. I do think this one is an underdog. Downside is that whales have manipulated the price to hell and back on Yobit because that place is a shithole, worse than Poloshit and Bittrex on their worst day.&gt;RDDI don&#039;t know what to think, because the concept isn&#039;t bad, but I don&#039;t believe we will see implementation any time soon because social networks (mostly Facebook) do not like outsiders messing with their shit. Same with BAT. Good idea, but I don&#039;t see Google or any other big ad companies letting this fly if they can&#039;t fully control it and there isn&#039;t any urgent problem to solve.
&gt;&gt;2284513thank you.First of all we are all gambling big time so do not bet your lunch money.That said there are multiple awesome coins that get me enthusiastic. But because they are already valued at a nice price not interesting in the short term for me.One that is however under valued imo is ZCash. the bump it got from the JP morgan news was basically not enough and it was over &quot;corrected&quot; afterwards.Working on their technology with JP Morgan is imo from multiple angles a huge step.Also I do believe that the strange monero move (also focused on privacy) really makes ZCash the winner for that purpose which is huge.Also I believe private banking is a big chuck of Forex which could lead to ZCash coin to be used/wanted which would explain JP Morgan being interested.So in short yes I have a shit load of ZCash bought on 9 K sat.But again, there are many other good options at this moment in time. Even the scam coins can be good short term :) but I believe ZCash will do good short term and long ..What are coins you are betting on?
&gt;&gt;2284683Can you explain XVG to me? I really do not getting it even after reading I believe almost all there is about it .. Thanks
&gt;&gt;2284732&gt;ZCashThis coin is doomed because of it&#039;s inflation rate. Stay away from this black hole.
&gt;&gt;2284798can you explain that pls? I just see that 1,451,931 ZEC as all the supply of coins.So how come inflation?
&gt;&gt;2284903https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4swjhVFFes
&gt;&gt;2284778As far as I understand it&#039;s a multialgo coin that uses i2p to keep transactions/users privacy. On the same game that DASH and and XMR. I believe people do not take them serious because it&#039;s a community project and it was DogeDark before they changed some code and made a rebranding.
Here&#039;s a business idea for you guys:Install a $20 tablet to a businesses point of sale system that the customer inputs their phone number into. Then these numbers get inputted into a database that I text promotions to every month. I charge the biz $50 a month for this service.
&gt;&gt;2284615are you retarded, just look up a phone book lmao
&gt;&gt;2284693I didn&#039;t know a phone book could link to a POS system and text 1,000 numbers a month. Thanks!
where the FUCK is BRASS golem reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
&gt;&gt;2284913I wanted to buy more before takeoff REEEEEEEEE why no more time to buy !!!
Is winter a good time to cash out?This party won&#039;t last forever. I feel like I&#039;m still in a dream with these gainz.
&gt;&gt;2284838Nothing is stopping you from slowly cashing out
&gt;&gt;2284838nobody can see a bitcoin dump from one day ahead and youre asking what&#039;s gonna be happening in 5 months
&gt;&gt;2284882Kaiser endorsed the fractal theory. Prepare for a long winter before the final moon mission (the real deal).
&gt;&gt;2284838We&#039;re fucked fa m. Crypto will be erased of the face of the Earth one day, that&#039;s why I&#039;m not investing anymore in.
&gt;&gt;2284914Why would it ever be erased lol gtfo
&gt;&gt;2284914HURRR OUR CURRENCY WONT BE HERE ONE DAY, SO WHY SHOULD I BE FILTHY FUCKING RICH NOW?more for me i guess
30,000% in 22 years. No risk. Mfw neckbeards go for shitcoins anyway.
Stratis got 67,000% in less than a year. Nice try, grandpa.
&gt;&gt;2283616stratis is 100,000%
Blitzcash up 700% in a week
OP where did you go?
&gt;&gt;2283574You know the Turkish Lira got descaled right? The huge jump was just the Lira being redenominated. they removed 6 0s from every Lira currnecy. So essentially for every 1million Lira there was there was now 1 Lira. That&#039;s why it jumped such an insane amount.
&gt;&gt;2283626Where 2 buy high
&gt;&gt;2283616&gt;&gt;2283626Strat didn&#039;t even get close to this who taught you yanks maths?
&gt;&gt;2283574roach pls go
&gt;&gt;2283616Startis reached over 100,000% ROI since ICO.If you barely invested 1000$ in Stratis from the start, you would&#039;ve been a millionaire.

2 days ago I deposited 0.06 ETH from coinbase to my bittrex account. Being a NewFag / NoCoiner, I didnt know there was a 0.1 ETH minimum deposit for the coins to show up./biz what do I do now. My ETH is with Bittrex i suppose. Opening a support ticket didnt do any help. Are my coins gone?Help
&gt;&gt;2284398no, you just need to transder more ETH there. Transfer another 0.0 and then it will show up, but consider that the transaction fees are already 0.01, so you might consider to deposit a slightly bigger amount
If some rich coiner could help me out, 0.04 eth..0xeec628ebde047a372870bb354d9e3c400797fdbethanks
&gt;&gt;2284398I think I got scammed too, i transfered eth to bittrix too and it never showed up :(
&gt;&gt;2284567&gt;&gt;2284398Theres a big ass red warning about this on bittrex when you go to get your damn address. Fucking read it.
&gt;&gt;2284398Just transfer 0.04 more nigger
&gt;&gt;2284398no they are not, happened to me too. when u buy more than 0,1 ETH they will appear. go to etherchain org and search your ETH address.
yobit has way faster deposits, and a better selection of coinsi also prefer the yobit UI better, its annoying to change to the order window to cancel your orders on bittrex, and go back to the trade window
&gt;&gt;2284422yea remember the fee&gt;&gt;2284540
&gt;&gt;2284398&gt;poloniex employees still astroturfing on /biz/ because nobody wants to use their scamming shit exchange anymore
Your eth is still there.They don&#039;t keep your money, they just won&#039;t credit it until you have .1 eth. Send another .1 eth and the .06 will be added too.Same thing happened to me broski.
&gt;&gt;2284603I might be partially retarded but didn&#039;t that warning say the address the ETH is coming from must have more than .1 ETH?? I just sent a test amount, but now I doubt that no ETH will ever arrive no matter how much I send.
&gt;&gt;2284398&gt;0.1 ETH minimum deposit for the coins to show up.I&#039;m holding 0.049 ETH and it shows just fine
&gt;&gt;2284398Hello friend, so im a complete novice at this but through tons for research and experience i found the best wallet and trading platforms,First getting BTC i used quickbit.com(im from canada)second I use coinomi to hold and trade alt coinsthese are i find the best and quickest and easiest for new people
&gt;&gt;2284721theirs a page you click In the warning that tells you to account for gas fees. every wallet ever will also warn you about gas fees.
&gt;&gt;2284764When sending from coinbase the fee said I&#039;d only be charge 10 cents. The bittrix wallet shows nothing under the balance.
&gt;&gt;2284707This is not true. I have tried it twice now. sent 0.11 ETH and nothing changed. Unless you need to do another transaction after that one, but I don&#039;t think so.
&gt;&gt;2284816I&#039;m not sure about coinbase as I&#039;ve never had the &quot;pleasure&quot; (lol) of using them.
Friendly tip.
&gt;&gt;2284524looks promising.

&gt;&gt;2281483OP finna tryna spike interest to the moon
&gt;&gt;2281284just bought $500 worth yesterday
There&#039;s a reason all these other shit coins are being pumped just stay tuned
Why? WHY WHY WHY
&gt;&gt;2281824News will be released this week
&gt;&gt;2281975Well I already have it cause I like it and I don&#039;t know why I like it but its pretty, give me a hint
&gt;&gt;2281284are you an idiot?

Getting impatient with this shit coin its going to dump so hard if it hits $40
&gt;&gt;2282281nice :DI always liked this coin, and I cant explain it but I have always thought it is pretty awesome
&gt;&gt;2282310Not all things go moon and up and down some are stable and happy
&gt;&gt; being added to bitstamp possibly monday&gt;&gt; getting lightning network and smart contracts&gt;&gt; on major exchanges like Coinbaseit&#039;s going to moon one of these days
&gt;&gt;2282335It is a lot faster and cheaper to sendI am a big fan
&gt;&gt;2281606Why does other coins being pumped mean anything for litecoin?
&gt;&gt;2282330if I don&#039;t have another 1000% gain week soon I&#039;m going to fucking lose it mayne
&gt;&gt;2282391The theif makes you look to the left while he steals with the right
I like just holding LTC as a backup reserve. It barely goes up or down. Just stays in a comfy 25-30 position.
&gt;&gt;2282484This is called consolidation
OP you better be right, im bagholding 115 LTC of this trainwreck
&gt;&gt;2282536&gt;trainwreckhow
LTC stealth lambo coin 2017the winner was right in front of our eyes the whole time
&gt;&gt;2282484lmfao you might as well invest in 2% annualreturn stock market if your risk-averseliterally NO reason to be in crypto for &quot;comfy&quot; returnsride or die nigga
&gt;&gt;2282769End of year will be very exciting
Yall think it&#039;s going to dip back below 25 again or should i buy now?
&gt;&gt;2282999The lowest you will see is 25 and some change
Litecoin is starting to moon. Its time. Our patience will now be rewarded
Hahaha polo just killed it, its LTC wallet went down :)
&gt;&gt;2283330Sell now
&gt;&gt;2283330what
&gt;&gt;2283290Garbage tier compared to other coins, adding it to coinbase was a big fat mistake!
&gt;&gt;2283330post proof
&gt;&gt;2283346LTC withdrawals and deposits are down
&gt;&gt;2283362Empty star.
&gt;&gt;2283362I do not think this is true please prove it
&gt;&gt;2283379fucking idiothttps://poloniex.com/exchangecheck right tableempty star on LTC, it went empty minutes ago
&gt;&gt;2283396what the fuck that star is for favoriting a coinyou click it to turn it on or offplease be joking with me
&gt;&gt;2283410Anon is just trying to FUD to get cheaper coins
In the long run, are you really going to profit that much from lets say putting in $1000 into LTC right now as opposed to lets say Waves. LTC maybe hits 100 in a year. Waves has a much higher potential. Even if it gets to just $50 in a year, you would have made 10x. Of course, i&#039;m talking about new investors, different if you have been holding LTC since below $10. Please correct me if i&#039;m wrong.
&gt;&gt;2283453in the long run we will be using LTC in everyday transactions while waves is a forgotten memory
&gt;&gt;2283453Stop looking at coins like scratch tickets
&gt;&gt;2283453Redpill me on waves sounds pretty beat
&gt;&gt;2282999price is stable af for the last few days preparing for a moon, buy now
That feel when I have 75 LTC sitting in my wallet since 2013.If only I bought more back then...
I&#039;m a holder, not a daytraderBut is anyone here making fortunes just buying at 24 and selling at 29? Seems really easy
&gt;&gt;2284022&gt;Seems really easyIt is really easy if your capital is already big, which mine is nott. 100 usd hodler
I quickly wanted to know whether making a little cash online is an actual possibility or if it&#039;s mostly just scams. Of course, I am not talking about making 500 $ a day for doing nothing (like some ads promise you) but rather something to get a little cash on the side. Especially if you got some competencies like a degree or knowledge of languages.
yes its possiblejust buy ARK
SEO, cyptocurrency, stocks, HQ freelancing projects all let you earn 500 a day if you put in the effort.
just trade shitcoins famalam
bumpin for intrest
&gt;&gt;2283090You can make some money doing usertests at testbirds.com or something.
Thanks for your replies. Do you guys have some suggested reading on cryptocurrency or &quot;online money&quot;? I feel like diving straight in is a bad idea, many shills seem to be around here. For example, I read buy ARK around 10 times in 5 minutes. Some arguments as to why it&#039;s good make sense to me, but I&#039;d like to have enough knowledge to make my own evaluation of these coins (maybe even stocks in general)
&gt;&gt;2283124I used to buy btc for sr back in the days. I followed the trend pretty long and whoever buys btc now should probably not do it.
&gt;&gt;2283208Read the whitepapers
&gt;&gt;2283223Well if you had kept those BTC instead of using them on SR you&#039;d be rich now. My mate spent around $3000 on SR about 4 years ago would be worth a little over half a mill now. lol.
&gt;&gt;2283385yeah i know, it&#039;s sad really. But I was young and had no interest in making any money.
&gt;&gt;2283354I can&#039;t find a book by exactly that name. Who is the author? Or are you talking about the historic document?
&gt;&gt;2283090ive been making money online since 2012, work online full time.most of my friends make money online too, lots of them into the six figures.so no its not a meme.
&gt;&gt;2283807Can you share some how you make money online?
&gt;&gt;2283766whitepapers lol. i get it now. kind of embarassing haha
&gt;&gt;2283090I make 12k a month purely from my online business ama
&gt;&gt;2284225How?
&gt;&gt;2283090Make a tutorial and sell it on udemy
Pajeet here, I make $100 a day programming for some canadians
&gt;&gt;2284225well, first of all, what is your online business?
i need help. Where do i buy alt coins? How do i do to not setting up a date with EYE R S?(Wink, wink, nudge, nudge). US citizen here take that into consideration in your graceful advise.
Poloniex.comTry to make some money first before you think about how to tax it (wink, wink). If you really should be successful - declare it
Why does everyone think cryptocurrency is illegal in the US or something?Just pay your fucking taxes dude.Just like the stock market, gambling, lottery tickets, and anything else when you ever turned little money into big money.
&gt;&gt;2284636Poloniex or Bittrex, which is better?
Guess I can ask my noob questions here as well. Right now I have a wallet that can only hold BTC. What should I get instead?
&gt;&gt;2284722Copy-pasted from a different anon:register on coinbasebuy a bitcoinregister on bittrexsend the bitcoin from coinbase to bittrextrade the bitcoin for cryptoput all trades into blockfolio app to see your gains/lossbrowse /biz/ to know what to buy into
What&#039;s up with these coin exchanges taking huge cuts? How am I to profit if I&#039;m gonna pay them 20% each transaction?
As long as I don&#039;t cash out and hold my coins, I don&#039;t have to pay shit, right?
&gt;&gt;2284800So I should just keep my coins in bittrex or poloniex instead of putting them in a wallet? I&#039;m not going to do a lot of trading right now as I am this new. I&#039;m just getting into it and learn how it works.
&gt;&gt;2284829You&#039;re not cut for this.Should have opened your own exchange if you wanted free money.
What car will you buy when your portfolio moons?
&gt;&gt;2276072It&#039;s already mooned. I could afford a used Gallardo. But why not just leave it in DGB? So then I can buy a Huracan.
&gt;&gt;2276072I might not buy a car. I might move out of the USA for a few months to forever. Maybe self deport myself back to Japan.
&gt;&gt;2276123This was my plan, use my crypto gains to stay in Japan for a couple months, maybe a year. It&#039;s be an invaluable life experience, the only problem is that I don&#039;t speak Japanese.
I&#039;m gonna keep my shitty 07 Honda Accord and play like I&#039;m still poor
&gt;&gt;2276072Id get around a 10 year old used Bentley for 50k
&gt;&gt;2276140&gt;The maintenanceEnjoy the $3000 monthly brakepads
This is how you hide from the cops. No tinted windows either.
&gt;&gt;2276072I am going to buy land.
&gt;&gt;2276072Lincoln towncar. Used. Black. Leather.
im a NEET and i have no interest in cars
&gt;&gt;2276072this thread already exists you nigger
&gt;buying things
&gt;&gt;2276167I see there are $200 online, so with labor that would be like $400 and it wouldnt be every month. Exaggerate much?
&gt;&gt;2276137Immersion is a good way to learn.That reminds me. I need to get rid of my junk, so that when the time comes to move, it&#039;ll be relatively easy.I have a lot of shit I don&#039;t need.
I&#039;m going to fix up pic related
&gt;&gt;2276072probably a tesla, keep the air clean and shitalso they have an antibio weapon mode, so there&#039;s taht
Depending on how much. Probably seek my 2006 Yukon and buy a fully loaded 2017 accord
&gt;whenFucking new coiners I just bought a truck last week cash money baby
&gt;tfw already own dream car, e39 m5i shall do everything in my power to make sure this fucking incredible car outlives me
A 1984 Lamborghini Countach
Gonna just keep my shitter and save all that money.
Mother FUCKING BASIC ATTENTION TOKENAnyone else getting rich off this? The goyim are literally handing me 7XAHAHAHAHHA
&gt;&gt;2284228bought in @ 8k sats. Everyone told me that I&#039;m crazy and won&#039;t see a dime in profits because whales will just dump on me.Who&#039;s laughing now
Bitcoin: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamEthereum: cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamStratis: Cheap ICO, collected money it needed, no scamBAT: Overpriced ICO, attempting to take everything it can from public, 95% owned by less than 100 people (35million in dev pocket)Overpriced shitty ICOs ruin a company before it&#039;s even bornDo the maths brainlets, feel free to buy Whale bags if you want to get owned
&gt;&gt;2284266Im a noob, can you explain what you mean when you say a whale (I assume people with a fuckton of money) will dump over you? How does that happen?
&gt;&gt;2284266Shills always come out against the good coins. It&#039;s a trend.
&gt;&gt;2284228Fuck you I&#039;m literally losing money bought at 14k, NIGGGERRRRRRSS
&gt;&gt;2284228Should I buy now senpai?
&gt;&gt;2284271ICO was fair, just everyone wanted to get into this coin, but only few could because of high gas price.Who was lucky now enjoying x5 gains, but coin now distributing to others.
&gt;&gt;2284330don&#039;t sell now you weak hands
&gt;&gt;2284306this is how it works anon...morons like&gt;&gt;2284266buy a coin at exchange launch at at least 5 times the actual value of the coin. then whales who bought into the ICO slowly keep increasing the price until it hits a poloniex, and with the increased buy support and higher price, they dump onto the morons like&gt;&gt;2284266and take their guaranteed 5-10x.this is a typical scenario, and idiots like&gt;&gt;2284266will pretend to have known all along, because he&#039;s a degenerate gambler &quot;&quot;&quot;day trader&quot;&quot;&quot;, like 95% of the sheep on this board.also&gt;&gt;2284271, this ICO has so many red flags it&#039;s ridiculous.
&gt;&gt;2284354To be fair it&#039;s only its first day on an exchange, but these FUDers are seriously making me get early wrinkles with their predictions that whales will dump it all soon to nothing. I hate the jews.
&gt;&gt;2284359Not really, dude. ICO&#039;s price can easily drop when it hits the first exchanges.
&gt;&gt;2284335&gt;ICO was fairabsolute rip off, they got greedy
&gt;&gt;2284411and you cannot give an example of that happening.
&gt;&gt;2284359&gt;exchange launch this exchange launch thatHahahahaha you&#039;re the same faggot that told people not to buy at 7k last night.Nice try you manipulative fuck. You&#039;re not getting my coins.
It&#039;s on my list of &quot;crypto to buy after I take gains from sia.&quot;
&gt;&gt;2284458nobody will want them soon enough, don&#039;t worry.
&gt;&gt;2284378Not a fudder and not involved in the coin atm, But they will and you should know that by now from watching other new coins.
&gt;&gt;2284569Can you give a specific example?
&gt;&gt;2284607Sia, which was a bit more short-lived than bat was. Eventually, it recovered a bit because of pump and dumps.There are longer and short examples in the charts, just go look =)
&gt;&gt;2284625Sia is shit though, BAT has a solid whitepaper, concept and experienced dev team. There&#039;s a world of difference between them. I&#039;m not convinced &quot;whales hoarding&quot; will affect the price in the short or long term, this coin is a winner.
&gt;&gt;2284650you sound like a gambler that doesn&#039;t want to be wrong.
&gt;&gt;2284650It might just be in the long run. Doesn&#039;t change the fact that whales will eventually dump all over you and price is going to tank for a good while. Could be a btc AND eth killer but it wouldn&#039;t make a difference, it&#039;s still got to happen.
&gt;&gt;2284271&gt;bitcoin&gt;ICOWhat?
&gt;&gt;2284650brainlet: the post
Doubled my investment at 7000 sats. Its the whales who sold that lost.
&gt;&gt;2284712Yeah, it&#039;s definitely a long hold for me.
&gt;&gt;2284730ICO: Initial Coin OfferingBitcoin: Initially sold at less than $0.1, with whitepaper and mining infoIt was the first coin, so obviously there were no official ICO websites....
&gt;&gt;2284446APX
&gt;&gt;2284791ICOs are for coins that aren&#039;t mineable. Bitcoin never had an ICO. I had taken a break from crypto when ethereum came out so not sure if it did or not but I&#039;m guessing it didn&#039;t either.
&gt;&gt;2284752I bought in at 7000, fag. Stay poor, anon.
&gt;&gt;2284818There are coins which are mineable and still have ICOsICO is essentially initial sale price, are you fucking retarded it&#039;s in the fucking word ICO
&gt;&gt;2284770no, they made 5x on your dumb ass
&gt;&gt;2284835Stop calling others retarded when you clearly don&#039;t even know the meaning of terms being discussed. Most coins do not have ICOs, if a coint does not start out with crowdfunding then there is no ICO.
&gt;&gt;22848254000 reporting in.Holding 50k feels good knowing that I&#039;m going to be rich if it just gets 5% of the total marketcap of ads.
God damn there are so many new people.

Augur (REP) is slowly rising back towards it&#039;s ATH. Right now would be a good time to buy in because if it passes it&#039;s previous ATH we&#039;re likely going straight up from there.
Told family about crypto months ago. They laughed. Dad talked about how the God he serves well stake and bet his life on thr USD &amp; stocks...while Rockefeller said US will be brought to it&#039;s knees in managed decline. Here&#039;s the statement from me then YT red pill vids but still sits and sits checking the market while it crashes.He used to be a man that woke up at 5 to start the day and now he&#039;s up by 1 PM everday being depressed and bitter towards his kids who are grown and still living in the house because our life was basically the movie Fences but we still press on.Still considered black sheep while penny stocks plummet. Mention Bilderberg group meetings and still try to tell him to get the fuck out. And nothing.Find a recepit on the table with a loan to pay off of 99K. He hasn&#039;t worked in months and refuses to sell his SUV and other junk to try and invest.No one is listening to me but go off and google crypto only to now guilt trip me into paying bills that can easily be eradicated by self sustainability.I&#039;m at my wicks end bros. Wells Fargo fucked me and I&#039;m just about to call it quits on all accounts. This has been my life for 28 years and I just want off this ride.I&#039;ve tripled small investments from saving and trying to make up for time I was distracted by jew porn and bullshit but still have this.I haven&#039;t seen my kid in 4 years because a cunt is violating a court order and the courts won&#039;t help me out without a big time lawyer. I told my senpai about ETH at $30 and they laughed. Now my mom is breaking her back trying to pay for food while I try and help out with bills but I can&#039;t pull out my $1400 just for another deja vu month.I know I can change my life now at this moment and get shit done but I can&#039;t look back again. This is Sodom &amp; Gomorrah times bros and I&#039;m getting salty every time I turn back to deal with their shit.What the fuck do I do? I really need help guys.
&gt;&gt;2282375get out of that hellhole and work your ass off. go to some random ass farming town and bust ass harvesting or planting. dont give me that &quot;i&#039;m weak&quot; bullshit, i was 49kg with no labouring experience and kept up fine with the random ass ethnics after getting into the groove.save your sweatbucks and invest in crypto, move to some random ass country and tell the western world to eat shit and die while you live lavish for a tenth of the price in some third world shithole.t. been in the same position
The best thing you can do is worry about you and profit. I tried telling everyone about crypto 3 years ago when I put $20 and no one cares. They didn&#039;t care when I had a couple of hundred and they said &quot;that&#039;s nice&quot; when I build my latest PC with profits, it&#039;s only the last couple of months when I have looked at my phone and said &quot;I just made $4k&quot; that they finally care.Results speak louder than works, show your dad results.
&gt;wicks end
&gt;&gt;2282435I tried but he literally wants me to literally show him how to invest in the basic BTC and then fuck off because he has &quot;trading experience&quot;I kind of want to sell my hatchback and invest in crypto....I&#039;ve got no bills but my family sort of relies on me without saying it.I have no friends because the blue pill doesn&#039;t interest me. You guys are the only ones who can call shit out and still be there to give advice. God bless for real.
&gt;&gt;2282456Whaaaaa?
&gt;&gt;2282375&gt;He used to be a man that woke up at 5 to start the day and now he&#039;s up by 1 PM everday being depressed and bitter towards his kids who are grown and still living in the house&gt;Find a recepit on the table with a loan to pay off of 99K. He hasn&#039;t worked in months and refuses to sell his SUV and other junk to try and invest.sounds like your family is in a tough spot anon, although you may want to post threads like this on /adv/you need to have a grown up talk with your dad, if you want him to respect you, you&#039;re gonna have to get a job at least until you can sustain life with crypto trading&gt;&gt;2282433is basically right although i think you shouldnt ditch your familyyour dad needs to get rid of useless status symbols like a fucking suv aswell and at least give crypto trading a try (this will be easier if you can show him your gains)
I don&#039;t think crypto is the fix to end your problems, but I&#039;d invest in it anyway. Having a baby boomer actively trading in crypto is probably dangerous unless they were traders in the last 20 years. Everything has changed.
&gt;&gt;2282839I do have a job, I actually make more than a wagecuck in half the time with my own freelancing but I&#039;m tired as shit and pull over and sleep sometimes on the road from staying up to look for more work to handling clients.I had a sit down with him and found out he invested in a tequlia stock and cannabis stock that were trendy tankers and he just refuses to listen. Everyone in this house just talks shit and gossip about my shit because I live an open life whenever I try to talk about real life problems (family, right?)I don&#039;t want to ditch them but if they won&#039;t truly help themselves, I&#039;ve gotta put my mask on now....my life has been on hold for years and I think this is my shot to really make it.I might really dip if thus dead horse won&#039;t resurrect itself.
&gt;&gt;2282375Hey fag do you enjoy your gains? If so STOP telling friends and family about it. Once it catches on , kiss these sick profits goodbye. Get that through your thick skull
&gt;&gt;2282375today I learned it&#039;s &quot;wicks end&quot; not &quot;wits end&quot;the more you know :]
&gt;&gt;2282925Yeah that&#039;s why I want to be the middleman and he can&#039;t handle that. He literally doesn&#039;t understand it but sees the gainz and is pissed every time I talk about it.The house already has $350K on it plus this hundo thundo flying on in.I&#039;m getting land with a small house on it if my investments take off. I have my eyes set on the prize of building my house on a rock and just living off the land and still do mining and trading.I don&#039;t know why people can&#039;t wrap their minds around the ease of this.
&gt;&gt;2282967Must be lonely at the top I guess, anon. I just don&#039;t want to be surrounded by weird asian faces from a brothel is all.
&gt;&gt;2282996God bless you, sir. Knowledge is power.
&gt;&gt;2282375Bumpity

Don&#039;t buy this coin. It&#039;s a trap; they are scamming you. Let these motherfuckers hold that heavy bag. If you don&#039;t buy it, they&#039;re out of pocket.Fuck them. Fucking asshole scumbags.
&gt;&gt;2272822what happened in part 1?
&gt;&gt;2273136What does this mean
&gt;&gt;2272427ELI5 on Verge please. What is the big deal with it?
don&#039;t wait for a dip that won&#039;t happen, just get on before it&#039;s too late or we&#039;ll be laughing from the moon.
&gt;&gt;2273136lmao someone&#039;s jelly about missing out on these sick gainz
&gt;&gt;2273136haha nice try.we all will be millionaires.
&gt;&gt;2273152there is going to be a dip...please don&#039;t be stupid and fall for these idiots trap there&#039;s been plenty of you that have fallen for this shit so don&#039;t be a fucking Jew and try to convince people to jump in only to lose money be patient and wait for the dip...
&gt;&gt;2273171just like the dgb dip, right?either way it will mooni&#039;m just saying buy while you can
&gt;&gt;2273145the red graph is a &quot;sell wall&quot;. It means people are dumping.High public interest, you will see a &quot;buy wall&quot;, as shown in green.What he&#039;s showing is people are thinking it&#039;s shit, or it&#039;s owners are dumping their own shares to scam the public to purchase their shitty coins.
This is going to dip again 100%This coin has potential but it will not be mooning for at least another year.
&gt;&gt;2273191Yep you guys are fucking idiots and falling for the trap congratulations
&gt;shilling verge after it was renamed from bitcoindark after doing fuck all for years&gt;developer is a fucking retard&gt;whale investors are greedy fucks
&gt;&gt;2273290Yeah I don&#039;t know, I took a look at the devs and they don&#039;t seem very good. I hope their announcement will pump the coin a bit so I can sell with some profit at least, but this is not going to be the next dgb sorry guys
&gt;&gt;2273290&gt;have sick gains&gt;throw in 500$ at XVG at 90 satsWhat can go wrong?
&gt;&gt;2273290here comes that fag talk
&gt;&gt;2273136what app or tool are you using to view these walls?
&gt;&gt;2273241It does but these idiots never listen and then will be the ones crying&quot;HURRDURR Y BIZ NO TELL ME JEWS WERE GOING TO DUMP XVG HURRRRRRRRR I LOST MY PaRENTS MONEY&quot;WAIT FOR THE DIP DO NOT LET A HUGE SPIKE DROVE YOU TO LOSE MONEY
&gt;&gt;2273290&gt;&gt;2273243&gt;&gt;2273136i hope you guys are right. i decided to sell mine after 1 hour lol. i made a few pennies desu
&gt;&gt;2273334you will want to do some Bruce-Genocide
CLIMING THAT WALL TO 100 SATSNAYSAYERS GETTING BTFO
&gt;&gt;2272427for some retarded reason I have a feeling that this coin will go to 300 satoshi in a week. I have no idea why, I had the same feeling for dgb tho&#039;
&gt;&gt;2273372120 inc
&gt;&gt;2273315The coin is worth jack shit. How cheap do you have to be to wait for the fucking dip of nothing
I got 600,000 a couple days ago.
&gt;&gt;2273315They forget a lot of people bought this coin at 5 sats for a meme.The coin is good but the community is small at the moment. it&#039;s following the RDD trend and I assume It will drop back down to 60/70 sats or lower and then stagnate for a while and the same thing will happen again until the coin takes off or dies.I can&#039;t tell if a lot of Anons genuinely believe the coin is going to reach 100 sats and continue to climb or if they&#039;re just shilling. I hope for their sake they&#039;re shilling or they&#039;re just naive.&gt;&gt;2273408That would depend on how much you&#039;re investing, because you&#039;re not going to make any money by buying in above 90 sats at this point.
this Volume.before it&#039;s on polo...Just saying.
I also bought 61,000 DGB two years ago when they cost 1/100 cent USD. Then forgot about them. Wish I had spent $60 instead of just spending $6
&gt;&gt;2273145It means you are being gamed. Don&#039;t listen to 4chan, it&#039;s full of cunts.That sell wall goes right up until ~1000 sats. With 3.5k BTC total value - that&#039;s $8.75m. It&#039;s a nicely laid trap - you&#039;re buying their empty bags. They pumped it, expecting kids like you to buy it up - all the way to 1000 sats.Fuck these cunts. Let them hold their empty bags.Look into bigger markets, they have less &quot;liquidity&quot;, although liquid enough to &quot;moon&quot;. &gt;1000 sats, maybe &gt;10,000 sats.If you want to get in on low market cap coins then look at ICOs; do your research.
&gt;&gt;2273425It&#039;s obviously a fucking meme the Sell walls are gigantic the majority of these coins were mined to shit so some Jews have just been accumulating this shit since beggining of time and waiting to buy their lambo cause some retards on here have no brain and jump in for the ATH cause it&#039;s mooning for a few hours
&gt;&gt;2273447t. salty mooncoin holder
&gt;&gt;2273432what do you mean by that?
&gt;&gt;2273447Fuck off, if I listened to 4chan I would be a millionaire right now. I didn&#039;t and now I&#039;m poor
99... come on baby...
What the fuck. Almost at 100 sats.If you bought at 90, or earlier. I&#039;d cash out now.
&gt;&gt;2272600i feel you man, have to wait till monday maybe tuesday till i can get more money to throw at memes
&gt;&gt;2273460it means hodl.watch the fud, it get&#039;s worse
walls are coming down fast. we about to break 100! after that its smooth sailing to 120
&gt;&gt;2273447That doesn&#039;t make any sense. That just means those prices are what people are willing to sell it at. If for some ungodly reason a massive whale moves on it over night, they want to be ready to drop their load for 1000 sats.
&gt;&gt;2273309Coinigy.
Gonna sell this at 99 and buy at the dip that comes with the sell walls
WE BREAKIN 100IT&#039;S HAPPENINGHODL HODL HODL
I&#039;ve been trading for 30 years, and I always heard &quot;The trend is your friend.&quot; Why do these stupid whales sell against uptrends?
hahaha that fgt that said this is a scam, those walls are going down fast, first 99 now 100, this will moon as hard as dgb in the coming week, the devs will announce something huge soon just wait
&gt;&gt;2273533The whales are the UP trend they dump after idiots accumulate and leave them holding until they wanna pump it again
if we can break the 43 btc wall at 100 we will hit 120 no problem. get in now for a quick and easy 20% profit
Waiting for the announcement, if it&#039;s good I will buy in at the price it&#039;s at, even if its 100+
Don&#039;t listen to people like this&gt;&gt;2273553
&gt;&gt;2273546How do they get instant fills?
&gt;&gt;2272573&gt;&gt;2272873&gt;&gt;2272974&gt;&gt;2273171&gt;&gt;2273243&gt;&gt;2273315&gt;&gt;2273453&gt;&gt;2273460&gt;&gt;2273546t. jelly hands
&gt;&gt;2273583if you set a buy order higher than the current lowest sell, it buys all those first, then buys the next. same for sells.
Can someone explain what&#039;s so good about a 30 second block time?
&gt;&gt;2273618transactions confirmed faster (bitcoin&#039;s time per block is like, 20m to hours right now)
Where&#039;s this announcement being posted?
100 you retards
100 being chiseled down as we speak. Stand ready for 120.
Chinese wale getting nervous
I think this will make it a few ticks above 100 and some people will drop sell walls &lt;105 (or they&#039;re doing it now, dropping them at 100 or just cashing out at 99) but if it makes it to 110, itll probably keep climbing until people who recently bought shit just get nervous and/or whales cash out.If this 100sat wall doesnt go down below 20 soon, shit&#039;s gonna crash.
&gt;&gt;2273577lmao wall is already down to 25 see you at 120 retard
&gt;&gt;2273653Whale. Sorry. Getting excited.
b-but w-whales and o-other shit ;__;TO THE MOON!
&gt;&gt;2273662if you&#039;re bag holding and nervous about getting fucked here, watch those top bids in the order book and keep your hand over the sell button, put your sell in for 97-98 (not 99) and when the 99 bid disappears and/or the 98 starts getting eaten into, click and sigh relief.now that the 100 wall is toast, (which isn&#039;t entirely from sales....people who aren&#039;t whales probably started canceling their sell orders once it got low in anticipation of it going even higher) we just have to wait and see where they put it now (110-112-115?) and/or when the whales say fuck it and cash out.
LIFTOFF
guys whats the end-game potential herei see stratis reaching $100, will verge hit $1? if so it would have about half or slightly less than half of the market cap if bitcoin

&gt;tfw you got in
ive been watching this moon since 75, its rolling through all sell walls. Sadly ive got not btc to put into, its pushing to 130 so fast

&gt;&gt;2273627Thanks, I figured as much but I really just wanted to post that for the HYPE

Wow I nailed it.Best trade yet, thanks fellas.
&gt;&gt;227380488 to 122 here. Was a good run, boys.

&gt;&gt;2272427Riding this train to the moon. 1 cent incoming.
HOLY FUCK
&gt;&gt;2273809This shit is like Kerbal. It just exploded into 2 smaller rockets, just waiting for them to hit the ignition
hahaha WEAK HANDS
lol it&#039;s going back up
hodl strong!IT&#039;S JUST THE BEGINNING
so many jelly hands, this going to hit that 140 wall
&gt;&gt;2273814&gt;&gt;2273804don&#039;t cry while we moon
&gt;&gt;2273839it&#039;ll take a hell of a lot of buys for people to gain enough confidence to keep buying 120+I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll go very far =( Huge price gaps mean crazy uncertainty
weaks hands selling and we haven&#039;t even heard the announcement yet. will be laughing at you from the moon
You have to be idiot if u sell verge now.&gt;i made 50e profit yeaaaHodl and make 50000k profit
Wait wait wait. So you&#039;re saying the whale owns 1,000,000 coins from 50 sat and sells them at 125, He made a profit of, wait for it, 75 cents USD.
&gt;&gt;2273854where is the preannouncement? how do we know it isnt a monero type troll? btw holding 1.4 million verge
almost got the noose ready when i figured it would dump at 100 sat so i sold 700,000 at 97 and it starting going up at fucking lightspeed so i rebought at a -40,000 verge. One day that could be like.... idk,$20? $20,000? Who fucking knows.
&gt;&gt;2272427Alright last chance, /biz/.Why should I buy XVG and not RDD?
RDD PUMPING NOW SWITCH QUICKLYITS GONNA DO THE SAME THING XVG DID100 SATS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
&gt;&gt;2273886both you faggot
&gt;&gt;2273886They&#039;re both being coordinated by private whale groups in this moment, don&#039;t be an idiot who buys at ATH.
&gt;&gt;2273881Wait. he made $1934, big whoop.
&gt;&gt;2273886&gt;Deus ex credits or normie faceberg coin
https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/870673407372910592LET&#039;S GO
electrum is working.
&gt;&gt;2273814Times how much volume?
Bittrex is being a dick again, pls help.
Anyone else see the words major announcement and think monero now regardless of coin?
&gt;&gt;2273996just gotta wait it out duder.... my gf and i transferred same time mine took 5 min hers took 2 hours
holy fuck i got memed by 4chan. bought at 127 sats. fuck this
&gt;&gt;2274035Anon I asked about Bittrex, not your orgasms. ;)
&gt;&gt;2273972Just baby bits unfortunately. I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to invest much in trading, so I&#039;m working with what little I&#039;ve been able to accumulate so far. I believe that trade put me up 50 bucks, which I know is chump change but it&#039;s a big victory for me.Once Coinbase FINALLY verifies me I&#039;ll actually be able to invest more.
just &gt;hold the line
&gt;tfw bought 500k for both XVG and RDD at 50 satlamboland is coming lads
&gt;&gt;2274051just hodl until 1000 sats, 2 months max
Diop stopped? It seems to be stabilizing. Guess the news was good enough. I don&#039;t understand all that electrum and i2p stuff.
&gt;&gt;2274051hodl you fucking fud, itll be 200 by tomorrow
&gt;&gt;2273996i don&#039;t know if it really does anything, but i always deposit through ltc and then convert to btc on bittrex. it works pretty fast
it&#039;s going up again pretty consistently now. hopefully we can keep the momentum. We gotta break 127.
&gt;&gt;2274108Why, is yours at 126?
That total trading volume is pretty insane for this coin. Not sure what will happen tongiht and it can definitely drop back to 100, but this thing just changed from a good pump to dark horse.
&gt;&gt;2274161what do you mean by dark horse
lmao look at the buy orders @ 120 and slightly belowit&#039;s gonna shoot up again
&gt;&gt;2273306&gt;&gt;2273307&gt;&gt;2273334&gt;&gt;2273425&gt;&gt;2273816&gt;spreading FUD so that the pump lasts longerthanks niggers
&gt;&gt;2274166He means that this thing might have legs and and bne next DGB
&gt;&gt;2274166A diamond in the raw with the potential to make it big. Unless it drops to &lt; 50 sat it will only go upwards in the long run.
one more dip please
&gt;&gt;2274051I bought in at 53 sats and still feel meme&#039;d.
&gt;&gt;2274193how big?
&gt;&gt;22743181 penny baby.
&gt;&gt;2272685Kek I was just thinking that
still eating through sell walls with ease. its not too late to get on this rocket ship
look at those buy orders, this is over
What is good about this coin? Explain
Is the pump over?
&gt;&gt;2274062if you aint first youre last. giggity
im hodlingeither moon or challenger shuttle fuck me
Gonna buy this dip, this coin is surprising and their radio has some nice jams
&gt;&gt;2274382Pump has paused. I sold because as I see it, there&#039;s too high of a chance for the whole thing to reverse.Best of luck to you hodlers.
&gt;&gt;2274441Same thing here.What I risk to lose at the current price is pocket change.What I could possibly gain is lambos.Whenever it goes down a little, many jump i nto buy the dip.Still predicting 100 as a solid new bottom. The Sky is the limit.
Any chance this would become somewhat of a Monero light? Like, say in 6 months Monero is at &lt;$100, and I only want like 2-4g of weed, do you think that verge could be able to fill that need with just a few coins instead using fucking decimals?
&gt;&gt;2274280Yeah everyone should have bought at 4 satoshis each.You know what I&#039;m going to do now? Buy in at 110 and sleep 10 hours while it&#039;s struggling with the walls.Because I&#039;m just that much of a no fucks given holder. I know it will raise.If a shit coin like DGB and XBY can raise from 1 sat to 2400 then everything is possible in a bull market like this.
I can scarcely believe this coin got up here. I used to have a bunch of XVG at 5sats. And it&#039;s now 100+. RDD, XBY, DGB, all these fucking shits absolutely blew up. Ehat is this shit.
Is XVG a shitcoin?I just impulsively bought $2500 worth at 155 and feeling major, MAJOR regret. It seems to be plummeting.Did I just buy a useless shitcoin? Fml.
&gt;&gt;2274837&gt;I just impulsively bought $2500 worth at 155Are you from the future?
http://vergecurrency.com/radio/I&#039;m in the telegram and the dev is continuously updating things. Like he checks in hourly. This is looking great.
Looks like it might be time for another peak
&gt;&gt;2274893sorry 125. nonetheless it&#039;s losing me money now. I may have made a terrible mistake
&gt;&gt;2275193Wasn&#039;t a mistake, but it&#039;s gonna take some time. XVG is probably going to keep rising the whole next week
&gt;&gt;2275193The order book looks better for XVG than RDD or bitbean if it makes you feel any better.Also the sell wall to 100% from here is a tiny fraction of the daily volume.
&gt;&gt;2275060Link to the telegram?
ITS MOVING THE WRONG DIRECTION REEEE
&gt;&gt;2275395https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAENIC3TSqpNQtMvkFw:)
&gt;&gt;2275403don&#039;t worry, it&#039;ll break through tonight. at least 130 sat by morning.
The subreddit has gone up by about 90 subs over the past week so that&#039;s pretty cool. Good sign for lamboland in like, 6 months
&gt;mfw saw verge at 4 sats...
&gt;&gt;2275193I have some news for you that&#039;s going to hurt but I&#039;ll refrain from saying it.Given that this is a bull market the price of this coin will likely rise. I don&#039;t recommend holding it though.
&gt;&gt;2274771Never doubt meme magic.
&gt;&gt;2276317what is your news
&gt;&gt;2276922See what I mean?S H A D I L A Y
Verge is going to go up massively. The market is starting to dry up. Trust me this is hitting one cent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hxibHJOE5E
Are these gains real life? Verge has been going fucking crazy today. I bought $100 worth a month ago (my first crypto investment) just because I remembered that I had some spare BTC sitting in an Alphabay account that I was too lazy to withdraw. I don&#039;t even know why the fuck I picked XVG specifically in the first place.
just showed up on bittrex front page with biggest gainz.broke 130
if the whales go through the 147-150 walls then it&#039;s game over
I am excited :)
&gt;&gt;2278602i&#039;ve been saying it for a couple days nowthis shit will moon fucking hard. hasn&#039;t even left the troposphere.
I only have 9000 coin, hopefully it goes higher, still 57% profit on what I bought is sweet
eat the 150 wall and were taking off so hard
&gt;&gt;2278701holfy fuck, that just happend^^
Whats the target for this coin, can it reach 1000 sats?I have to admit it looks like a shitcoin, the graphics look poor quality...... almost like xby and i didnt hear about it at all until a few days ago.Very strange. Possibly a scam.
&gt;&gt;2278822not a scam. heavily interesting. probably dgb status. get on.
&gt;&gt;2278822gonna need bigger fud
&gt;&gt;2278828Whale talking
an hour ago we were talking about the 150 wallnow the 180 wall is being chewed up
How are you guys storing your XVG?
&gt;&gt;2279167choosing color for my lambo
I put in 20 usd cause it was all I had at 140.Thanks lmao
Nice. I did it guys, I held. It was dipping hard when I went back to sleep but I knew how this will play out. Now it&#039;s over double what it was.Someone wanna feel my arms?
&gt;&gt;2279264&gt; *hugs you*
tfw only bought 10k at 53 sat for the meme
I just bought the top
&gt;&gt;2279275Well done pajeet
Is the dip coming
Seriously guys is this a realcoin or a shitcoin?What can it reach realistically, $1? $10? Hesitant to buy....I visited their website looks kind of unprofessional and the scrolling doesnt work, I have to manually use the scroll bar. Seems fishy............ and why did the hype only start recently? Never heard about it before yesterdayI missed dgb and siacoin I don&#039;t wanna miss another one.But I was scammed with posw so Im very cautious. Thanks!
&gt;&gt;2279376fairly high right now and dipping, so I would watch it and wait a little bit before jumping in. It could hit 150 sats and either bounce up or fall belowalways a risk jumping in especially at ath
&gt;&gt;2279376I don&#039;t think it&#039;s too late to get on Siacoin for longterm. Yeah you missed some waves of volatility but I think it&#039;s a good pick up at 600ishSafer than this shitcoin
&gt;&gt;2279376Volumes have increased steadily over the past weeks, it&#039;s somewhat of a shitcoin, but it has some potential of booming I think. Very risky. Not mooncoin risky tho lmao.
It hurts every day
&gt;&gt;2279431&gt;Got the keys to a lambo, but threw them away...
&gt;&gt;2279422There&#039;s no real short term risk here so any trader who can keep an eye on the markets WILL make money out of this. Just look at the buy orders, there&#039;s constantly huge sums of BTC supporting the green pillars
I&#039;ve spent some time in this coin&#039;s IRC and bitcointalk thread and the dev seems legit. I&#039;m gonna hold.
&gt;&gt;2279410&gt;&gt;2279419&gt;&gt;2279422So essentially its to flip a profit, correct? Noone will actually use &quot;verge&quot; currency.
so when&#039;s this shuttle going to crash and burn most of you alive?
&gt;&gt;2279468No one will actually use 95% of the cryptos, it&#039;s basically just speculation who will get to the 5%.
&gt;&gt;2279479From 1 to 10 how jelly u are?Got 128k at 65, it droped to 30 but i trust this coin, so the iron hands gods rewarded me
https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/871232404668764160it can be our rocketfuel
Sold 400k XVG at 17 sats for 0.05 BTC, if I HODL I would have 0.5 BTC worth 2k now. Kill me now
lol coin dipping before they release the whitepaper, good time to buy
Any chance for 1k sats?
&gt;&gt;2280101only worth 1.2k
&gt;&gt;2280531easily, just be patient
sell orders around ~180 pulling out, we&#039;re going to the moon boys
&gt;&gt;2280531Easily, but not if you&#039;re a wannabe-daytrader who expects it to happen today or tomorrow. Some knowledgeabe people I talked to projected XVG to 0.01$ in the short and &gt;1$ in the long run, but they were uncertain about the time.
Verge dev is the hardest working dev I have ever seen. Don&#039;t forget to donate some profits to support Verge development. See donation address on the bitcointalk page.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1365894.0
Bought 59k at 16 sat feels gooood my bruddahs
Did I miss this one?
pulled out at 170 sats &amp; left some for future gains. I think I might jump back in again
&gt;&gt;2280585Not subtlety
This is a scamming piece of shit.I&#039;m warning you DON&#039;T use their official wallet.I sent 1 million to the wallet 3 days ago from Bittrex and the balance still says 0.Support is non-existent and when you ask for help you get trolled in IRC.Shit is fucked I don&#039;t know what the hell to do. Paradoxically the exchange was safer than this piece of shit wallet. Goddamn.
&gt;&gt;2280706I&#039;ve used the wallet extensively and had no issues at all.maybe you just did it wrong.
I just bought 50k. I hope I didn&#039;t catch this thing on the way down :(
&gt;&gt;2280719Fuck me. I&#039;m not a complete retard.If I copy and paste my recieving address right now from the wallet - I will see my transcation on the blockchain perfectly.Yet the client shows 0.00 XVG and says it&#039;s fully synced.What more could I do? This wallet is fucked, they must scam every 1/100 person to avoid raising suspicion.
&gt;&gt;2280743Maybe try resyncing?
&gt;&gt;2280743Try Electrum, you won&#039;t need to sync with the blockchain.
&gt;&gt;2280672Nah man, hop on. 1000sat in a few weeks
&gt;&gt;2280743You probably havnt given the wallet enough time to update the blockchain it took me a few days to get it up to date
&gt;&gt;2280706&gt;mfw trying to sync the wallet&gt;took a day for only 25-30%&gt;turn off my computer at night&gt;wait fuck my sync&gt;turn back on&gt;open verge wallet&gt;freezes at splash screen&gt;fuck, let me open again&gt;takes forever at splash screen, fuck it im going to bed&gt;leave computer on with splash screen of verge wallet open&gt;sleep, wake up&gt;wallet sync at 15% onlyLiterally fuck this shit, this pile of trash is going no where. I&#039;m pretty fucking sure this is what happens when you have a shitty ass fucking coin with a huge number of tokens. I have to sync all possible transactions between the fucking billions of retard coins they have.REEEEEE, stop making fucking shitcoins with tons of tokens you little nigger ass fags.

How does a total newfag get started with a drop shipping business?
&gt;&gt;2284708It&#039;s a meme now, too oversaturated
&gt;&gt;2284708Drop shippers don&#039;t provide any value. The only way to make money in drop shipping is selling courses in drop shipping by going to Chang Mai and rip off all the millenials trying to be &quot;digital nomads&quot;

How can you look at this graph and not buy in?It looks even better than ETH did when it was at $10
&gt;&gt;2284099Constant growth with only small dips. If you don&#039;t buy in this, you literally hate money.
&gt;&gt;2284099&gt;How can you look at this graph and not buy in?Because I already bought in
if only i had money to buy more
&gt;&gt;2284106Buy more
What makes you believe it won&#039;t dip more?
&gt;&gt;2284099Noob here. Why is it about to moon? Will it continue to moon? How long?
&gt;&gt;2284121Stop trying to make this into some sort of pump and dump scheme, you sound like a desperate bagholder. This is a long-term coin not a short one
&gt;&gt;2284099Bought at 5 sold at 10 , invested in xvg at 45 sats. Doing pretty well w/o strat now
&gt;&gt;2284099grrr please stop posting these. i have wanted to buy in since last week but its hard as fuck to jump through all the hoops if you live in UK
&gt;&gt;2284150Well if it&#039;s long term and you think it&#039;s going to increase eventually, wouldn&#039;t it make sense to buy the current dips? You&#039;ll have much more later for less, assuming the price increases.

So what&#039;s the deal with this coin?Some kind of crowdfunding/project management coin? Value doubled since I bought in about a week ago. The official website/blog has all the usual crypto-speak about innovation, utilising blockchain, decentralising etc.Looks like Microsoft has a finger in the pie too.https://twitter.com/wingsplatform/status/866620320177901568Anyone know anything about it?

&gt;&gt;2284000Mooncoin is a confirmed scamcoin. Get out whilst you still can.
I just got blockfolio to confirm. I can&#039;t find it, but already got dem sweet 3x gains from it going to 3 seats so no biggie
&gt;&gt;2284000Still works for me.
&gt;&gt;2284000I don&#039;t know why i had to laugh so hard on that picture
Why don&#039;t we make ourself a trust fund for /biz/ where people buy shares/chunks of the fund using cash, and some Autists put the money into crypto and give part of the profit to the owner of the share? Seems foolproof
Because the jackass would run off with it all.

Such as obvious pump n dump, but I really dont want to drop my other pump and dumps yet.
I only have like 5% of my portfolio in GNT but I have the feeling that when it moons, it&#039;s going to moon BIG.. I&#039;m hoping I can cash in some of my other coins and buy in more before that happens.
Brass is just around the corner, around 75% done. Have all my golem in a cold wallet for security. We&#039;ll see how brass goes but now is definitely an accumulate period.
Missed BTCMissed LTCMissed ETH&gt;TFW no other coin will rise to the topSeriously is this it for the top crypto currencies. Everything besides these three fall into the category of alts and spend their time being pumped and dumped into and out of existence.
&gt;&gt;2284170Agreed.
Everything is an alt, until it isn&#039;t.
&gt;&gt;2284170LTC is just getting started
&gt;&gt;2284170&gt;Missed LTCwat
If you&#039;re looking for the next &#039;main&#039; currency, there are a few plays you can attempt.DGB has had strong growth over the past few days, and is currently in the middle of a dip.XRP is also in a dip, and has good market cap already, as well as being currently working on working with mastercard for international transfers.If you just want a risky play that could give you lots of dosh in the short run, perhaps look to XVG (very risky though).You might also consider looking at one of several currencies that are trying to become to Ethereum as Litecoin is to Bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2284234poor summer child
ETH is retarded, STRAT is better ARK is better even XRP is better than ethereum imo.
&gt;&gt;2284234&gt;2027&gt;this is it guys, this time LTC will finally moon
&gt;&gt;2284170Ark and Strat
90 billion market cap for crypto70 trillion market cap for stocksI think there will be new coins that will rise to the top eventually
newbie question here, big appreciation if you&#039;re in EUhow much money do you people spend on each alt coin to hold?
I don&#039;t think anyone can kick themselves for not getting into btcETH is arguable, since it did something new but there are going to be better versions of it in the future.LTC is still on the rise.No one can see the future. Everyone has 20/20 hindsight.
Ark, Strat, &amp; Bat
&gt;&gt;2284518it would be funny if it weren&#039;t so sad
&gt;&gt;2284170Then stop being some entry-level hodler fag praying for a ticket to the moon and learn to day-trade.
So after all, DGB is just a &quot;really fast&quot; coin.Bravo, DGB, Bravo.
&gt;tfw this retard probably sold when BTC dipped last week and lost a fuck ton of money
probably, normies have the weakest hands
&gt;&gt;2283740&gt;tfw this retard still doesn&#039;t understand the real purpose of cryptocurrencies and just keeps buying them hand over fist in a virtual free for all they can&#039;t control.
I have 50/50 on Sias and DigibyteSell Siacoin to buy DGB, hold to 9th june and after it buy Siacoin or hold everything?
&gt;&gt;2284651hodl both
&gt;&gt;2284651Same here solid plan but i suggest seeling it everything june 8 as the Minecraft news will either triple dgb or plummet it
Is that your whole portfolio?
&gt;&gt;2284651My best guess is that in either scenario for DGB, the price will rise more than it will fall.I would just hold. You&#039;ll feel so dumb if you sell the day before it triples.
so buy DBG, sell it after 10th and buy Siacoin or do nothing?
bump
Papa thanks for buying Strat
Been following cryptos for a while but never bought in, I&#039;m planning buying for the first time this week but I&#039;m completely lost. My plan is to buy through localbitcoins and then move them all to ethereum, is there any guide that I can read to help me through this whole process?
&gt;&gt;2284578If googling is too difficult for you, you&#039;re entering the wrong space
&gt;&gt;2284596Man, I didn&#039;t know moving bitcoin around would be such a buffer. Also it&#039;s kinda hard to know what to trust when it comes to googling about free money, it&#039;s daunting to google all this cause you never know who&#039;s jewing you and what&#039;s safe.
If it&#039;s a large amount of money involved and you want to hold, look how hardware wallets/paper wallets etc work. Google Nano ledger.for the exhange, set up an account on an exchange (poloniex, coinbase..) and exhange your btc with ethereum. You can buy your btc from localbitcoins and have it send to your wallet of your exchange
so how many lambos are you going to have once this becomes worth 0.1 usd in 2 weeks?
&gt;&gt;2284481good luck selling it off without tanking the market
&gt;&gt;2284591Even if it .1 usd that&#039;s only 20k, not nearly enough to crash it
&gt;&gt;2284606look again
Cloak is pumping again. 200 btc volume added to bittrex in the last hour after the dump.
Thin walls and the volume keeps growing. Looks intresting desu. Might grab some.
&gt;&gt;2283831literally free money
&gt;&gt;2283873Just bought some
&gt;&gt;2284018Nice man. It&#039;s already up 30 btc volume since I posted this. Shit is gonna explode again soon.
&gt;&gt;2284095Yeah I think so too. It&#039;s the top gainer right now on bittrex so it&#039;s gonna pull in massive volume from that alone. Thanks for the heads up.
400 btc volume now and growing
&gt;&gt;2284383How high do you think it will go?
&gt;&gt;2284598Not sure man but there are only 5 million coins and a 12.2 million dollar market cap so it wont take much to pump it to the moon.
Great long term coin. Team received funding from Gates foundation and Tim Draper. Actual real term use, and being adopted by major companies. Why haven&#039;t you bought any yet?
Not memey enough for /biz/

&gt;he thinks the united states government is just going to sit idly by while cryptos dominate the world market and push the petrodollar into irrelevance
&gt;&gt;2281112There is fuck all they can do at this point, it&#039;s already too far gone. They are in checkmate at this point. For the first time they don&#039;t hold all the power.
&gt;&gt;2281112you statists will soon find out just how your beloved authoritarian gov&#039;t is the exact opposite of almighty
&gt;&gt;2281112If they try to ban it, they lose tax dollars and people will just cash out somewhere else.The same thing happens if they tax it unfairly.The only way to stop it at this point would be to sic the CIA or some other dubious organization on it to try and FUD it into irrelevance.China was probably thinking that when they froze their markets, it worked, for a few days.
&gt;&gt;2281154&gt;There is fuck all they can do at this pointwell, the cia can start by targeting and assassinating whales. you think they can&#039;t? you think they won&#039;t?
&gt;&gt;2281190&gt;The CIA is a all powerful omnipent being&gt;Rich people don&#039;t and can&#039;t defend themselves
&gt;&gt;2281212&gt;he doesn&#039;t think that it&#039;s the genuine rich people (not nouveau riche cryptomillionaires) that control the cia in the first place
&gt;&gt;2281190What good would that do?It&#039;d eliminate whales from the equation which won&#039;t do much besides make pump and dumps rarer. There may be a small crash if they threaten whales to cash out but new ones would take their place.
&gt;&gt;2281190You just turned a potentially interesting thread to utter retarded garbage.
Its about time we make our country with cryptos as fiat
&gt;nocoiners still copingoh boy
&gt;&gt;2281212Well the CIA is the only organisation which can legally do murder, terrorist attacks, start wars, human experimentation, etc.All in all they are pretty powerful
&gt;&gt;2281112Its a different world now though.When Gadaffi was trying to build the african union based on gold lybian dinar (an idiotic idea, but threatening to hillary and the dems), he didnt have any real backing of China, Russia or India.Now, China is building the greatest infrastructure project of the world - the silk road. First train with goods from london has already arrived in shanghai. Russia and China trade with each other in local currencies, not in USD. India is wary of China but cuddly to Russia. There&#039;s gonna be a triangle of trade that includes half the world population in the region and does not include USD. Ponder this.
&gt;&gt;2281112This. As soon as crypto becomes a threat to global hegemony, they&#039;ll ban trading it.
&gt;&gt;2283597&gt;ban crypto trading&gt;what is decntralized exchange
&gt;&gt;2283901when we ban things we start at the personal level. Is your personal bank account decentralized? Is your internet connection?the next step is to outlaw untraceable financial transactions, something the US already does above $500 or $1000 depending on the type of trade.a lot of what you guys are doing with cryptos IS ALREADY ILLEGAL in the US. It&#039;s just a matter of them deciding to enforce it.
&gt;&gt;2281112Japan already &quot;legalized&quot; it. Now any country who bans it is giving free money to Japan because people with crypto fortunes aren&#039;t just gonna be like &quot;o well i guess that moneys gone now&quot;. They&#039;re gonna go somewhere where it&#039;s legal.
They will be behind the shadows of the cryptosphereThose shadowy ass bitches
&gt;&gt;2284444&gt;a lot of what you guys are doing with cryptos IS ALREADY ILLEGAL in the US.Like what?
&gt;&gt;2282656It&#039;s only legal if they don&#039;t get caughtWhen they&#039;re in the middle of one of those operations
&gt;He didn&#039;t bought STRATIS
&gt;&gt;2284442What are you talking about?

&gt;&gt;2284491aww man, i could only get 25
800 SATS by tomorrow morning. You first heard it here, faggots.
Confirmed Moon Mission!Next weekend.Be prepared.Whales accumulating.
Easily 800. If not 1000. This coin is rock solid. Even if it crashes I don&#039;t mind holding it till recovery, because I know that by years end it&#039;ll be worth 10-100x at least.
its rebounding get in quick
More like 1000
Not sure if I should buy more now or wait a bit... Got in way earlier but I need more...
Everyone that&#039;s not buying now should be ashamed of themselves.
This is an obvious shill thread. I&#039;m in deep in SIA, but I didn&#039;t even know people would bother trying to shill it
i&#039;m all in!
&gt;&gt;2275375So what you&#039;re saying is that you&#039;re a cunt?
DGB REFUGEES WELCOME
&gt;&gt;2275394pls no
I&#039;m hoping some freak cashes out at 700 and knocks it back down into the 400s before it jumps again so I can get more.
crypto newfag here, what the fuck is a sat?
&gt;&gt;2275590Satoshi. .00000001 of a bitcoin
I&#039;ve never seen such an aggressive attempt to keep a price down, even DGB wasn&#039;t this fucking bad.
&gt;&gt;2275635Tbh we&#039;d see more of a rise if polo would get its sia withdraw sorted out
&gt;&gt;2275624thank you, it&#039;s been bothering me not knowing what it is
SIA: http://sia.tech/1TB - $2.00/mo Storage Cost1TB - $1.00/mo Bandwidth CostSJCX: https://storj.io/1TB - $15.00/mo Storage Cost1TB - $50.00/mo Bandwidth CostSia has much better pricing. I&#039;d stick with them.
LMAO you retarded fags. SIA is not a CURRENCY. You cannot buy anything with it, you can only rent out the few gigs on your HDD that aren&#039;t filled with hentai to other retarded faggots who bought SIA.Once the novelty of &quot;muh cloud storage&quot; dies off, SIA dies too.Once people start hosting illegal shit on SIA, it fucking dies again and permanently and you lose all your money. You really think a cloud server with ZERO oversight and regulation won&#039;t be abused and be brought down by international government agencies?&gt;but muh freedom to host anything I wantYou can&#039;t host anything you want, retards. There is super illegal shit out there and it&#039;s not good for society to have unregulated and uncontrollable cloud storage. You&#039;ll just have pedophiles in third world countries abusing kids even more using SIA to send shit to first world countries.Fucking idiots. Buy RDD coin.
&gt;&gt;2275717bro I&#039;m just here to make dem bills
&gt;&gt;2275717Illigal shit is being hosted since the beginning of teh webz. Get over it.Storage of data is becoming a bigger and bigger market.
&gt;&gt;2275717fuck off retard
One this hits 50 cents I&#039;m buying a new car and moving out
&gt;&gt;2275717SIA isn&#039;t cloud storage like google drive, dropbox, etc.Each file is split into pieces, encrypted and stored at different node locations around the globe.Only you have the key that can put the puzzle piece to each file back together again.
&gt;&gt;2275635The whale can&#039;t fool the market forever. Don&#039;t worry, he wants it at 1k too. If not tonight then definitely tomorrow.
&gt;&gt;2275717nobody cares about what the coin can or can&#039;t do just pump this shit and make money
&gt;&gt;2275735Yeah, but not on a platform as mainstream (relatively) as SIA.&gt;get over itI can&#039;t get over how retarded you dumb faggots are. sorry.&gt;&gt;2275742literally kys you autistic down syndrome&#039;d tard
&gt;&gt;2275749No fucking shit, I know how it works. What will it be used for? USE YOUR FUCKING HEAD.
&gt;&gt;2275717Idiot. Fuck you. I wouldn&#039;t even piss on you if you were on fire.
this shit dropping to 550?
&gt;&gt;2275788No it&#039;s at at 630 and gaining a huge buywall of rising support.
we&#039;re getting rich faggots, im calling 1b market cap within a week
&gt;&gt;2275806well just dipped to 585. not seeing a lot of movement on this shit either. my confidence is purdy low desu
&gt;&gt;2275717It can&#039;t be brought down. By anyone. That&#039;s the whole point. The economics and logistics of decentralized cloud storage actually make sense, unlike compute *cough*Golem*cough*. This coin and all the other storage coins are going to the fucking moon. And there&#039;s nothing you or anyone can do to stop it.
&gt;&gt;2275179the thing about SC is that it&#039;s going to go up no matter what.whether it&#039;s ATH is 800 or 1000sats and it stays there forever you won.if it stays where it&#039;s at right now at least you have coins to use for encrypted cloud service and basically buying cheap right now.win-win.
&gt;&gt;2275777LOL. anger issues much? I know daddy beats you and you think SIA is your way out of the basement, but it isn&#039;t. RDD is.&gt;&gt;2275850Oh really? So you&#039;re predicting a future where public, easily accessible cloud storage exists, that has NO regulation, oversight, or control? SIA will be nothing but CP and snuff films. Terrorist cells will use it to share plans.... and there&#039;s nothing the CIA can do to stop it? That&#039;s fucking hilarious. None of you retards understand that a product must integrate into society to be beneficial.Why do I even waste time trying to teach you retards.
&gt;&gt;22758211b cap would make it .05 right?
&gt;&gt;2275891I&#039;m not *predicting* anything. That already exists. It&#039;s called TOR. Sia, Storj, and MaidSAFE are just better, more economically efficient mechanisms for achieving the same thing. Learn literally the first thing about crypto before you start spouting off on here.
&gt;&gt;2275179Just bought 50000 Sia. Actually read their website. Good idea. I missed DGB, but I won&#039;t miss SC.

SC bull pennant forming. We are about to break out to 800, strap in gentleman

&gt;&gt;2276176It&#039;s a consolidation before moving up again.http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:flag_pennant_continuation
&gt;&gt;2276155I&#039;m going to need some triangles man
&gt;&gt;2276170about to give up on DGB, how should i divide into them, 50/50, 60/40 or whut

&gt;&gt;2275717&gt;I bought at the tip of rdd and hate money and don&#039;t understand technology :(Must be hard being you. Keep your chin up, champ
&gt;&gt;2276271Thanks man, I appreciate it
look at the volume on this sucker holy moly
I&#039;m just hoping it drops a little more before hopping in. I think I can wait until 580 safely before it runs up again
&gt;&gt;2276313just get in now, by tomorrow there&#039;s no way it&#039;ll reach 580
&gt;&gt;2276313I think the floor will be around there, I kind of expect it to hover in this area for a bit.
&gt;&gt;2276328Yeah that&#039;s what I was saying with the pennant. It will oscillate a little until it continues the previous movement. So it swung up to 600 now and I am trying to catch it on the other side
&gt;&gt;2276192&gt;he uses meme triangles and doesnt just throw his money at random shitwhat a time to be alive

EAT YOU MEDECINE AND TAKE AWEY FROM COMPUTERhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gamblingProblem gambling (or ludomania, but usually referred to as &quot;gambling addiction&quot; or &quot;compulsive gambling&quot;) is an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler&#039;s behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.

Any place to transform some eth into siacoin?
&gt;&gt;2277208TO BITCOIN
&gt;&gt;2276826And your point is?
What is wrong with Siacoin withdrawals on poloniex?
Some idiots are really angry here, because they missed the train... What&#039;s wrong with you?
rockets only just taking off, 800 should be a breeze, give it an hour and itll be there i reckon
&gt;&gt;2275652What is keeping them from activating it?
We&#039;re going to the MOOOOON!
&gt;&gt;2278846moar of this
Buy now, it&#039;s a key moment
&gt;&gt;2275744Yeah sell me your coins, you low aiming motherfuckerI&#039;ll by a yatch
&gt;&gt;2278839&gt;&gt;2278545Not sure what&#039;s up with it, it&#039;s been on and off over the last couple of daysIt&#039;s a shit because you can&#039;t mine to the polo wallet, got to download the standalone and wait a gorillion years for it to sync up
&gt;&gt;2275891Drugs are integrating so damn well are they not?
&gt;&gt;2278867I have the wallet sync&#039;ed up but I just want my funds to go to my wallet now, fuck you polo
&gt;&gt;2278846
I got 12,800 bought @675.
&gt;&gt;2279165I made a little bit off trading the highs and lows today and I have to say I think @675 it&#039;s a bad investment. It&#039;s gonna bounce off 700 at least one more time. Maybe sell at 700 and rebuy at 600
&gt;&gt;2275179&gt;tfw your going to make more of sia then eth, and I got into eth at $3.It doesnt get any better than this
I&#039;m a bit disappointed that I sold 6 million sia at 630 sat.Should&#039;ve held out a bit more.
&gt;&gt;2279213Dang hope you got a nice profit though! I had my sell order at 670 when I originally had it set at 690 since I didn&#039;t think it was gonna make it back to 700 but it surprised me
&gt;&gt;2279231Oh yeah, for sure. I bought mine at 37 sat. Bought my pot at 20k and I sold 6 million at 120k. I just could&#039;ve sold it for a bit higher.
&gt;&gt;2279252If u send to me a little amount of it i will hope you luck and say very thank you. Ask you about 0.01 btc, do you help me? If i make more money i will send to you some part of it. Why 4chan ppl do not help each other? If i make by this 0.01 btc 0.1 btc i send to you 0.05. Or if i make 5btc il send to you more then .5btcASK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY 0.05 BTC AND SHOULD RETURN IT TO MY MOTHER TOMORROW
no one is bothered that this is an open source project?whats preventing amazon from making their own sia?
SC is getting dumped. Time to take profits. Stop losses are under 575. Run thoses SLs and buy the dip.
&gt;&gt;2279442&gt;weak hands
&gt;&gt;2279454Smart hands. There&#039;s no real support until 550 imo. It will drop again before pushing past 700

What the actual fuck? This thing grows for 3 days straight and THE EXACT MOMENT I BUY it crashes? I got in with 5 BTC at 2600 SAT, being promised 10K SAT due to that 9th of June event and now I just woke up with -40%?Why do you do this to me /biz/? Please tell me I am not the only bagholder.
&gt;&gt;2282247&gt;buying athHAHAHAHA FUCKING FAGGOT
&gt;&gt;2282247Thats why you dont buy high
&gt;&gt;2282263&gt;&gt;2282252This cmon dudes. No matter what use your reasoning
Same shit, bro. Bought RDD for 125 and now i waiting for miracle.
&gt;&gt;2282247dont buy ath you retards. even if it seems like a good idea, think about how what goes up must come down. now hold you faggt
&gt;&gt;2282247buy high sell low, you are dooing gods work annon
&gt;&gt;2282282And how should i determine ATH?
&gt;&gt;2282247&gt;Why do you do this to me /biz/?Don&#039;t blame us, you watched instead of buying.Pro-tip from someone that is getting pretty good at this, look for spikes in volume for a very short time before the price can rise much. This is whales buying up long before they consider actually moving the price more than 10% for more than 2 days. Picture very fucking related https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_sbd
&gt;&gt;2282247You should totally sell now to avoid even bigger losses
&gt;&gt;2282297look at the chart, look at the 24 hr high.are you anywhere near that? thats its all time high.
SIA AND DGB ARE SLOWLY GOING UP. WE ARE STILL THERE GUYS
&gt;&gt;2282297if...its at an all time highare you fucking stupid? even if it goes up to 2800 sat from that point, buying the CURRENT all time high is the stupidest fucking move ever, that&#039;s literally just gambling and hoping it still goes upfucking retard
&gt;&gt;2282247BUY HIGH SELL LOW
&gt;&gt;2282247Here&#039;s an inconvenient truth DGB HODLERS dont want you to know.If you didn&#039;t buy in at +-100sat, don&#039;t buy now.
Welcome to Biz! Enjoy your stay.
&gt;&gt;2282247&gt;2600That was literally an ATH that lasted mere secondsDid you not realise it was a shortlived pump?
&gt;&gt;2282322I&#039;ve bought it at 800 and sold yesterday at 1850.(But, yeah, i&#039;ve fucked up with RDD)
&gt;&gt;2282247Why havent you selled yet? cut losses and move on cuck
&gt;&gt;2282247You won&#039;t lose money if you just hold it.DGB will at least go to 3k or 4k by Friday.
What a fucking loser, can&#039;t even make proper gains.Why don&#039;t you just sell now and cut your loses before you embarrass yourself any further.
&gt;&gt;2282372Rebuy now during the dip, its floating around the mid 90s (95 right now) with some weak walls at 100-120.Investors will eat these low buys up and it&#039;ll gradually climb back up to the ATH in the next few days or over the week.Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it breaks through 150 next weekend.
&gt;&gt;2282247somebody had to pay for all my gains.thank you OP.We actually need more people like you
&gt;&gt;2282426I would not be surprised if it will drops to 30-50, so it quite trashy analysis. I am still in and will not buy more of it.
&gt;&gt;2282247Start entering your trades in increments, use proper money management, be patient and ignore shills
&gt;&gt;2282298Exactly what I did with FLO. Look at the chart, beautiful. Four major spikes in the past two weeks or smth.Very clear to me that syndicates are accumulating.
&gt;5 BTC&gt;on DGB&gt;weeks after that anime poster was heavily shilling at 100 sats&gt;ATHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
&gt;&gt;2282298&gt;&gt;2282737That being said, I don&#039;t like the clear downtrend in SBD desu
Because you bought so much so fast lmao and at ath
&gt;&gt;2282737Hey FLObro, I actually like the down tread on this one because the accumulation is fucking huge and you can buy right now lower than their average buy-in.
&gt;&gt;2282809What is funny is that I actually already bought SBD (2K) and then panic sold everything when BTC crashed to 1700...I sincerely though it was gonna test 1200...In short, I lost like 35% on SBD. But maybe gonna buy in again. Thx anon.Did you spot any more accumulation phases in particular coins?
&gt;&gt;2282426Only losers average losers.
&gt;&gt;2282247Sell before it&#039;s too late.
&gt;&gt;2282847Several all on polo, I won&#039;t name them as too many people getting on-board will make them delay for weeks but you know what to look for.
&gt;&gt;2282875Fair enough, danke
&gt;&gt;2282247&gt;9th of June eventeveryone keeps talking about thisbut i see no eventis there an actual eventfuck
&gt;&gt;2282247SELL NOW OR LOSE IT ALL
buying btc right now will be a be a bad move unless you plan on hodlin. BTC will surely break this channel to the downside and resume its trend line after a bounce of 1500-1800.
&gt;&gt;2283502https://www.techforintegritychallenge.com/They are going to be at this thing
June 22nd
&gt;&gt;2282401I hate this fucking faggot
Shouldn&#039;t the 9th be a good thing? It&#039;s a new announcement. Why is it dropping then?
&gt;&gt;2282737when do you think they will start pumping? what percentage gains are you expecting?
&gt;&gt;2282247&gt;h-hope you bought t-the dip!
&gt;&gt;2284380I am not all a professional trader, that being said I expect it to start pumping once it breaks the 3700 resistance level.100% gain is fine by me but considering what all the other coins have done so far I would not be suprised if it would quickly pas the 6000 mark, bounce back and go up again.
BUY BUY BUY
&gt;&gt;2283842Where is it?
This is where we forgive ourselves about bad sells and missed opportunities. We forgive ourselves so we can move forward.I forgive myself for converting all my ETH into ETC... when ETH was at $130... just because someone on twitter convinced me to.
&gt;&gt;2281365i forgive myself for jumping in on Omni as it was mooning, gettting out at the peak, then getting back in to ride the waves, only to end up losing 40% of everything. before i went to bed i decided to move everything to zcash cuz i thought the chinese were gonna fuck me over, instead I woke up to a new Omni high, while I was holding the bad on Zcash. its ok desu, you learned from that mistake.
I will no forgive that cunt who told me to sell stratis when it was $1-$2 just because he&#039;s a nigger.lesson learned.
I forgive myself for not going all in on ETH when it was 85 dollars. I still put a lot in, but it eats me up that I could have put in a lot more in.
&gt;&gt;2281365I forgive myself for being okay making more conservative moves and only making about 20% a week with my 0.1 BTC.
Start the BATmobile Robin, were rallying again.
&gt;Buying into a coin where around 20 people own 90% of coinsJesus CHRIST why is /biz/ so dumb?
&gt;&gt;2284560&gt;implying the whitepaper or devs are any less credible for this reason
&gt;&gt;2284542smd joker
&gt;&gt;2284560Yes a coin backed by the creator of javascript and and awesome browser in the billion dollar ad industry.
Wait til LTC dips to ~$22-24 then hold til it peaks (probably will hit $40 sometime before the end of the year) then just move it all to BTC or ETH (as those will rise/be stable) then cash out once I&#039;m content.Think I can double a $10k investment before the end of the year with minimal risk.Tell me why this is a bad idea?
doubling is for cucksi multiplied my shitanon here had turned $175 into $2000 in 2 weeks. Don&#039;t be a cuck OP, multiply your shit.
&gt;&gt;2282326Yeah, but that involves taking more risks. Which I&#039;m not ready for at the moment.I&#039;m not a NEET. My wife and I both have well paying careers and we own a successful business as well so I&#039;m not looking to get rich of this crypto stuff. Just want to snag a few thousand here and there. Always looking for more streams of income.
&gt;&gt;2282487Gas yourself.
&gt;&gt;2282326I turned 276 into 500.I panic sold at loss when BTC surged and everything went red to ride the btc, still lost a little bit. Could have been 600, but 2000? JEsus how did you do it?
&gt;&gt;2282487&gt;my wifeYou won&#039;t get too upset if LTC goes bad, you already made the worst investment of your life.
&gt; have 100 @ $20&gt; ltc goes to $40 by end of yr&gt; double money&gt; exchange to eth&gt; eth is up 10x&gt; less eth than beforeyou just lost money
&gt;&gt;2282573Lol not on here to defend my wife like a fucking whitenight.
&gt;&gt;2282598So you&#039;re telling me to invest in ETH? ETH may go up 10x eventually, but I can&#039;t really see it hitting higher than $400 by the end of the year.
&gt;&gt;2282831because... ?can you tell me the reasoning behind it?
&gt;&gt;2282801no, my friend - you&#039;re the one who will need to defend. In court. Your assets chopped in half... doubly painful assuming she knows about your crypto - do you have to ask her before you buy a position? Jesus.
&gt;&gt;2283546Lol I make all the financial decisions. I&#039;m asking for advice from you all.And if she were to take 1/2 that&#039;d be fine. We literally make the same annual salary (give or take) and started/now run the business together. All the new age feminism is bullshit and drives me up a wall too, but you do realize that women can make money too, right?Inb4 women&#039;s right fag. No, I still agree men are smarter. I just happen to get lucky with this one.
&gt;&gt;2283510Reasoning would be what I&#039;ve read online from anons. Does it mean anything? Probably not, but you fuckers have been right before.Should have invested in ETH at $70 when everyone was telling me too, but I&#039;m dumb.
&gt;&gt;2284404And you&#039;re being fucking dumb now. Put that shit in literally any other solid coin and multiply your gains. Segwit and UASF come out for Bitcoin by the end of the year and litecoin has literally no advantage over bitcoin. LTC will tank. Betting on LTC is betting against BTC and that hasn&#039;t worked out for anyone so far
Hi Op. LTC investor here. It&#039;s a good coin but it isn&#039;t pumped and dumped like these new altcoins. People actually hold on to LTC coins more than others. It&#039;s a tortoise in the crypto race among a bunch of silly rabbits but as the story goes the tortoise always wins. LTC reaches a high on June 7th and than levels out until it reaches another high on the 21st. Its followed a 14 day cycle the last two times so I imagine it will do the same again.Biz is mostly full of young cocky guys who don&#039;t know anything about longer investments. They have weak hands and only invest for short-term gains. You can&#039;t go wrong with LTC. Don&#039;t let them persuade you otherwise.
Hey anons how many of you have fked yourself good selling during a dip? I myself was down $700 two days ago. Last night i was even and up $800 during sleepy time. Now im down $100 now. Still dont care. How many of you can actually stomach this how many of you dump your coins like the neets you are?
&gt;&gt;2284108First time I bought Crypto I bought 6 ETH and then lost my key.Second time I bought Trumpcoin, panic sold after the election, tried buying back in on the inauguration pump and ate shit.Now I&#039;m holding RDD and not letting go. According to calculating a maximum price of a coin by BTC cap/4 multiplied by your coin volume, RDD has a possible ATH of 35cents. Which would unironically put me in lamboland with my current holdings.
&gt;&gt;2284177There&#039;s a formula for determining ATH?
&gt;&gt;2284108I once bought into Dash at 100 and sold at 50. Learned a big fucking lesson that time about holding and I never fucked up like that again.
Why is no one talking about the best performing coin Vertcoin / VTC ? Dont believe me just look at the exchanges. Also look at the past chart - massive potential for mooning
I have been watching it for a couple days. Got in around 15000, since then it has increased volume by 150BTC, No walls in site. I wish I had more money, I would be accumulating as much as I can before this thing takes off. Got a nice little buy dip happening right now too.
LOL I remember when this shitcoin was supposed to be the next Litecoin or some shit for being ASIC resistant, didn&#039;t happen.
&gt;&gt;2283964yet
&gt;&gt;2283970It has a really shitty past anon, massive pre mine, it was normal back in the day bit the devs tried to cover it up which left a real foul taste in everyone mouth.
&gt;&gt;2283992And now Poramin the scammer is behind Zcoin and did equally shady stuff there too (remember zerovert?)
fudders gonna fud, this shit is gonna pop off with or without you
Applying for Air Force. What are some benefits in the AF would help my career path (computer engineering) and education (college drop out). What questions should I ask my local recruiter to get the most necessary information? e.g How is the pay? How much money would I get for college? Can I take college course while in training program?
&gt;Can I take college course while in training program?No, you have to wait a year after you finish tech school.&gt;How much money would I get for college?While serving you get TA, which is like 1000 a year, you get your post 9/11 which is like 30k, and you get a certification stipend worth like 1000.&gt;How is the pay?I don&#039;t think the pay is too terrible when you consider a majority of your check is tax free. BAH, BAS, All pay when deployed, separation pay (for wives/husbands), uniform stipend are all tax free.&gt;What questions should I ask my local recruiter to get the most necessary information?Look up the jobs, get the closest computer job to engineering as possible, don&#039;t take general, don&#039;t take security forces because he shows you some fucking video of off duty cops doing doughnuts, draw a line in the sand and tell him it&#039;s whatever CSS job you want or nothing.
Get married. Even if its just to a dude you knew growing up
&gt;&gt;2282579This is actually pretty good advice, it gets you off base housing faster, gets you more pay across the board, just don&#039;t marry someone in tech school otherwise they&#039;ll steal everything in the divorce a week later.
&gt;&gt;2282451&gt;(computer engineering)You&#039;re fucked. Real hardware engineering is done in Taiwan for 40k/year. US is still taking on a hundred thousand of poos per year to do basic tech support and destroy the supply side of the market. Hence the rise of hacker rank, and other skills filtering services.
&gt;&gt;2282539&gt;I don&#039;t think the pay is too terrible when you consider a majority of your check is tax free. BAH, BAS, All pay when deployed, separation pay (for wives/husbands), uniform stipend are all tax free.Thanks this is really informative. Is this apply when you&#039;re reserve deployment?&gt;don&#039;t take security forces because he shows you some fucking video of off duty cops doing doughnutsJust curious why?
&gt;&gt;2282748&gt;this apply when you&#039;re reserve deployment?Yeah reservies should get the tax brakes when deployed, although if it&#039;s an internal deployment (somewhere in CONUS) I don&#039;t think you get any tax brakes.&gt;Just curious why?Because it wouldn&#039;t help you in your career at all, You&#039;ll stand at a gate for 12 hours a day looking at IDs. losing another two hours for arming/de-arming every day.
&gt;&gt;2282451Buy eth
&gt;&gt;2282748It sounds like GI Joe/Call of Duty action man stuff, but it&#039;s more like checking badges at the gate.
Hey if you&#039;re a little socially awkward i.e. you have mild manifestations of &quot;autism&quot; in the 4chan definition of the term, how bad of an idea is the military?
&gt;&gt;2282451Why? Just get a job at a bank entry-level and then invest it all in crypto. You&#039;ll literally be a millionaire in years without all the bullshit that the military has to offer.
&gt;&gt;2282539Hey, my husband applied and they pay for his college but he only gets his money from being in the reserves. How do we gt that 9/11 stuff? State is Wisconsin.
buy dgb, big announcement on june 10
&gt;&gt;2282451don&#039;t waste your time unless you are have toam in, essentially a wage cuck where you can&#039;t quit and you are surrounded by idiots doing meaningless shit 90% of the timeif you have any ambition, i&#039;m sure you can find a better path
Try /k/ even though they are faggots these daysLike someone else said, if you are smart and have the ambition, go do something else. IMO being an enlisted loser is shit unless you have a cool job (which is not likely). If you are interested in the military for any reason at all, get a bachelors in literally anything and join as an officer.If you are dead set on enlisting, then don&#039;t believe anything recruiters tell you, unless it is in writing in your contract. If you are a college dropout but have some credits you may be eligible for an instant promotion (I think for 20/40/60 college credits). These are negligible because you will have to work hard as fuck to get past, like, E-4.&gt;Can I take college course while in training?After tech school, yes, but you&#039;ll be lucky if you have the time to do more than one or two classes. It looks good to them to do a few things on the side though.&gt;How is the pay?You get a free solo dorm and like $20k a year. Not bad for a job that requires almost no qualifications.Like the other person said DON&#039;T DO SECURITY FORCES, that is like being an RA in college, it looks cool to have slight power but you are actually a fucking loser. If you are for really /fit/ though and want to be super cool do CCT or PJ or something. If you are good with computers look into Crypto Linguist. It is the hardest shit but you will actually come out of the AF with a future in something besides being a cop.Also look up Kyle Gott on YouTube, he is a normalfag but he tells you literally everything about applying for the AF.
&gt;&gt;2284055This, don&#039;t be a shill for the elite. Open your mind and eyest. ex army
&gt;&gt;2284055&gt;essentially a wage cuck where you can&#039;t quit and you are surrounded by idiots doing meaningless shit 90% of the timeSound like the current job I have. 10hrs/day 6days/week and 90% clients and workers are female&gt;&gt;2284124&gt;If you are interested in the military for any reason at all, get a bachelors in literally anything and join as an officer.I want to join the service just to get a better discipline of myself since i have an extremely autistic personalities and lifestyle make it difficult to socially. I heard about bachelors before joining before, can&#039;t you do it the other way around?

Sup /Biz/Several of the largest online bullion brokers are now accepting BTC for gold/silver purchases. Since local cash for gold places will pay paper cash without reporting obligations for quantities up to a few ounces of gold (10k), what&#039;s to stop people from exiting to fiat in 5k chunks without having to deal with all the bullshit? Since there is no paper trail or bank involvement it seems like the risk is minimal if someone didn&#039;t change their lifestyle and used a few different gold/coin shops.
&gt;trading cryptos for goldwhat a shitty deal
&gt;where did you get those ingots?&lt;huh, I just ...mined them&gt;ok thenYou really think the IRS is this stupid? No one would pay taxes on anything if it were that easy.
&gt;&gt;2284204Gold transactions under 10k in USD do not have to be reported to the IRS.
&gt;&gt;2284204&gt;Gold bars lying in a basement&gt;IRS has xray vision and knows that they are there.If you dont flaunt your riches, the boys in dark blue wont know that they are there.Just sell the gold to jewelers in small portions if you need money and have them pay you cash.Use the bitcoingold to pay your living expenses and save up your regular income.
&gt;&gt;2284195&quot;local cash for gold places will pay paper cash&quot;Think you missed that part.
the paper trail is the bitcoin for gold place&#039;s business records. if the irs scoops them up you&#039;re fucked. other than that it&#039;s a fine plan if you want to pay cash and never touch a bank.
&gt;&gt;2284223Why would anyone not break up their transactions in 10k chunks then?This all sounds retarded.
&gt;&gt;2284392There are a lot of big fish out there. People who own a lot of gold aren&#039;t going to want to make tons of repeat transactions of 4 or 5 ounces and gold brokers would get weird about someone trying to do this 100 times.
&gt;&gt;2284437Different brokers, different names (using family members etc), different amounts.......Hiding that shit is easy.The IRS isn&#039;t going to open a fucking investigation into some kid, who bought a 100k worth of gold, where you need multiple agents and tons of resources, just to compile the information (which has to be gathered in different states in the worst case scenario).They are busy with the big fishes and only go after small time stuff if you are stupid.
&gt; www.bitlisten.comIs there a thing like this for altcoins?
Monerosound.info, but it&#039;s offline now. The source code is available on github though.
SOMEONE EXPLAIN ME WHY BITTREX WONT CONFIRM MY DEPOSIT ITS BEEN 4 HOURS
&gt;&gt;2284258is it BTC confirmation you&#039;re waiting for ?did you verify your account?2fa ?
It&#039;s probably just because BTC takes hours to transfer. Bittrex is not the issue here
&gt;&gt;2284258You used BTC didn&#039;t you
&gt;&gt;2284288This. Check it again tomorrow morning.And buy a better crypto next time.
&gt;&gt;2284258They didnt steal your money you impatient fuck
&gt;&gt;2284258I used to be an impatient fag like you. Now I just buy litecoin to send to exchanges. Confirmation takes like 2 minutes on average. Don&#039;t be stupid. Think of btc as a cargo train, then think of ltc as fighter jet.
&gt;&gt;2284258buttcoin is for HODL, not fast transactions
Don&#039;t worry OP, I transfered BTC to Bittrex through cuckbase and it took 2 hours. I know yours has taken longer, but as long as it says pending it will be there soon.
&gt;&gt;2284274Yes I verified my account, yes btc&gt;&gt;2284288yes btc&gt;&gt;2284303yeah&gt;&gt;2284313i want now&gt;&gt;2284327suck a dick fanny&gt;&gt;2284328i see&gt;&gt;2284390sucks&gt;&gt;2284423hope so

When will you fast food slingers ever learn just to buy ETH and STFU? When will you ever learn to stop playing the altcoin pump meme. Seriously, How long will it take. Post your opinions please
&gt;&gt;2284370What are you talking about?Thanks to the altcoins pump I now have more ETH than 3 days ago

&gt;&gt;2284370ETH is a scam
I don&#039;t believe in ETH any more. There are better alternatives in development. I&#039;m rooting for ARK and STRAT over ETH. Even XRP is a better coin than ETH imo.
Well played my friend. For you are a smart man after all. Keep playing and acquiring ethers at all cost no matter what.

What is the best trading platform? I have a need to draw triangles and see support/resistance levels.
&gt;&gt;2284226what product do you intend to trade with it?
Bittrex offers these tools. Plus you can draw all the lines and fibonaccis you like.Their order book graph is kinda shitty tho.

Heads up to newcomers for every person making money here, someone is losing it.
Yes, the normies who will have to pay $10 for every satoshi.
&gt;&gt;2283437Let this happenPRAISE KEK
low-information normies are losing it
&gt;&gt;2283437this tbqh, we will gain and the normies will lose in the future.We are still early in the grand scheme of things, if you buy into non-meme coins right now (BTC, ETH) you literally cannot lose.
&gt;&gt;2283423No ones losing money, we are just kicking the can down the road to the person who will lose it.Like playing hot potato.
&gt;&gt;2283423Cryptocurrency trading is the reallocation of funds from weak handers and normies to whales and HODLERS
&gt;&gt;2283490Yeah the strong hands always win during a dump. Stfu faggot
&gt;&gt;2283486&gt;no one&#039;s losing moneyBullshit. Where the fuck do you think the money comes from?
&gt;&gt;2283638it comes from people investing in cryptothat doesn&#039;t mean they are losing it
&gt;&gt;2283654&gt;it comes from people buying my bags
&gt;&gt;2283696its like that for literally everything, gold, silver, fiat currencyits just a store of value like every currency that has ever existed
You coin shillers shouldn&#039;t be investing your money if you don&#039;t even know where your profits are coming from
&gt;&gt;2283423&gt;Losing (((money)))&gt;not realizing this IS the new money, and people are selling dollars for the price of pennies right nowISHYGDDT
Does this shit feel like early 2016 ETH to anyone else? The community enthusiasm and even the price movement feel like deja vu.
&gt;&gt;2273523you better hold that shit nigga
have you seen the video interviews of the CEO? He doesnt give me confidence.
&gt;&gt;2273523Even the fudders are angrier than usual kek. Welp, i didn&#039;t listen to eth, I ain&#039;t missing another one . and even if it turns out not to be, I&#039;ve still made some pretty sweet gains.This dip getting pretty scary though h00000ld
Buy this while it&#039;s on a dip, it will surely reach $13 today.&gt;&gt;2273541Don&#039;t pay much mind to the communication skills of the people behind it, pay attention to the tech. See Monero for example, the dev is a fucking retard troll autist, but it doesn&#039;t change the fact that Monero is the best currency.
&gt;&gt;2273541does vitalik give you confidence?
&gt;&gt;2273541Do any of them?&gt;anonymous grandfather satoshi&gt;russian methhead&gt;i don&#039;t know any other ones but i should
&gt;&gt;2273605more than stratis ceo, yes. the way in which a person speaks can be indicative of the way a person thinks.
&gt;&gt;2273523Wish I could buy some right now, but I&#039;m holding some solid shit that looks good as well. I hope I&#039;ll yet manage to get on this train too.
&gt;&gt;2273580its double topped already
&gt;&gt;2273541Would Vitalik give you confidence in 2016?kek
&gt;&gt;2273708Double topped yesterday too and then reached new highs today, TA doesn&#039;t mean shit on narrow time windows.
I think it will go up but there&#039;s definitely something weird going on with Stratis. Go to Bittrex and take a look at the sell/buy orders, literally walls and more walls of sell and buys of 0.05 Stratis, this is literally nothing in terms of money and it&#039;s likely that it&#039;s someone manipulating the market to create fake walls of buys and sells.Not only that, whenever this coin starts to go up, it&#039;s always very weird, like it goes from $8 to $10 in a matter of seconds and then quickly goes back to $9-8, then goes back to $10 again, then these fake orders start to pop up and the market &#039;&#039;stabilizes&#039;&#039;Keep watching and I&#039;m sure a &#039;&#039;sudden rise&#039;&#039; of the price will happen very quickly, it has been like this ever since it got to $5
&gt;&gt;2273762People cashing out to buy sia and DGB according to forums and troll boxes. They will return once those pumps are over. that pattern your recognizing is people trying to keep the price down but are having a hard time controlling it.
&gt;&gt;2273762I actually noticed this too but it seems like a collaborative to intentionally double top everytime it gets too high so it has time stabilize ofc idc because the money is ridiculous lmaonoticed this with dgb too but now it&#039;s getting out of hand
&gt;&gt;2273837&gt;&gt;2273875See, It was &#039;&#039;rising&#039;&#039; now and as I&#039;m observing, every time someone puts a high buy order, like 7k Stratis or something, his order gets engulfed immediately by fake buy orders of 0.5 or less each, and high sell orders start to pop up immediately too.Heavy manipulation going on with this from all fronts.
&gt;&gt;2273976Think about it tho, Whales or someone with a lot of cash invested in strat see&#039;s another better opportunity for double or triple gains (See sia and dgb). So he drops sat and buy&#039;s into those. But in order to keep the price low so he can buy into strat, He uses a bot to keep the price low artificially in order to jump back in relatively were or better off than where he was.
&gt;&gt;2274015Problem is, in all this we are like puppets in a marionette game played by whales. They are basically manipulating the market to control our sell and buys so that they can keep profiting, like you said. We can try to anticipate their movements by observing the market carefully and make more gains too in the process, but that&#039;s basically gamble as they seem to have a big control of the price. Or we can hold with iron hands, but that&#039;s also risk imo, for the same reason. I will keep holding, but would say to pay attention to the market and be careful, shit seems very fishy ever since the price got to $5.
Also, Id say the resistance level atm is around .39/8, so that wuld be a good buying point.
&gt;&gt;2273541&gt;He doesnt give me confidence.Did vitalik give you confidence?
My strat and waves are crashing. I&#039;m tieing the noose now
&gt;&gt;2274093whales wouldn&#039;t try to do anything if they know the price wasn&#039;t going to go upfor example ripple, as soon as they found out xrp wasn&#039;t gonna even be used by banks it was dropped like a rock and never got back up again
&gt;&gt;2274553im all in with strat and dgb
&gt;&gt;2274580I hope you are right. Patterns are on our side, but it&#039;s difficult to take emotions out of the equation when there&#039;s so much money involved.
&gt;&gt;2274553&gt;tfw I could sell out at $7 and still make profitGlad I got in early. Still gonna hold this for the long haul though. It actually seems like a good coin with genuine usage potential.
WTF GUYSIT&#039;S ALL OGRE
&gt;&gt;2275238what does this mean?
&gt;&gt;2275238If you ain&#039;t playing this coin for the long game you got into the wrong coin
&gt;&gt;2275260Red are the sell orders
&gt;&gt;2275238&gt;&gt;2275260as soon as you posted it it reversed lawl
&gt;&gt;2274553legit, unless you buy absolute shitcoins you can&#039;t lose, whatever you buy will past the point you bought eventually, just cos it doesn&#039;t triple in a day no reason to panic
&gt;&gt;2275274
&gt;&gt;2275294oh, shit. -_-
Got 10 extra strat from this dip. Nice
So what does Stratis do that Ethereum can&#039;t?https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereumhttps://github.com/CiaranJones/Ethereum.NETThis shit is literally not needed.
&gt;&gt;2275294Please explain
&gt;&gt;2275406Lack of sleep i didn&#039;t notice the chart was mirrored.
&gt;&gt;2275390Here come the butthurt eth fanboys kekity
I&#039;m gonna keep making Strat gains if these people keep freaking out and selling. Drop it lower you pansies
stratis pls i bought you yesterday
This is honestly a pretty big dip, it went from $12 to $8, either it&#039;ll crash or now it&#039;s the best time to buy.
&gt;&gt;2275512i havent seen a dip on a coin this big since like 2 days ago
I&#039;m no expert by any means but this looks to me like something you could see integrated into Windows or Microsoft Office in the future
holy fucking dog shit if you just bought that strat dip youre fucking golden
&gt;&gt;2275732got it at 32k lmao
&gt;&gt;2275732dfw. got out at the bottom of shakeout.
This coin is insane. That was more like a nosedive than a dip, then landing on a trampoline for the bounce.
How much STRAT you boys holding? How far to the stars are you gonna take it?
&gt;&gt;2275825about 1,100 i&#039;ll wait until 200$ to sell
&gt;&gt;2275839&gt;1,100Fuck anon, I wish I got in earlier. About to drop 1k on bittrex for it, coming out to around 100 STRATS. If this reaches ETH levels of gains this time next year then we&#039;re all gonna make it.
lmao nigga that bear trap was so epic it was almost biblical lmao i thought i was going to lose my house nigga lmao
I was waiting for a dip on ETH to go all in and then I decided to trust you faggots and buy Strat not even knowing it was at the perfect dip. Got 950 of these bad boys and have already made $800 in two hours thanks to you guys.
&gt;&gt;2275825&gt;How much STRAT you boys holding?Enough for the node.
&gt;&gt;2275857fuck nigga, i bought 100 for $40. damn glad i got in at 50 cents and $2, i am about to drop another 1k in it too. good luck brahs
&gt;&gt;2275903Fug it, just bought 110.1 STRATS. Hope it will be worth a lot more in a year&#039;s time.
&gt;&gt;2273637Computer engineer here. Lets see you speak highly technical stuff in front of huge audience with an assload of cameras directly pointed at your face. You wouldn&#039;t even step on stage you fucking faggot.
&gt;&gt;2275937how much more could it really be worth? 10x? 20x? a year is a long time to wait for that.
&gt;&gt;2275957Shit man, ETH was only $10 at one point. Who the fuck knows
If my guess is right, the pump is gonna happen at late night. Get ready.
buy it and don&#039;t sell it desu desu senpai senpai
&gt;&gt;2275902So how much do you need to hold to make running a node worthwhile?
Prepare for the rise.
&gt;&gt;2275948this.Public speaking is something very few people do well...Takes a lot of practice.

Since radeon cards are now impossible to buy anywhere, what would be the next best thing? Would 6 GTX1060&#039;s make a good mining rig? They seem to be readily available at under $200 and their hashrate and TDP are in line with the RX470.
&gt;Since radeon cards are now impossible to buy anywherewhat?
&gt;&gt;2282993RX470, 570, 480, and 580&#039;s are sold out literally everywhere, or being scalped for &gt;$600. I managed to buy one 580 the other day when newegg had some in stock with a &quot;1 per customer&quot; limit, but even that sold out quickly.
&gt;&gt;2282979where you finding them sub 200?

&gt;&gt;2283104If the 6gb was this price I think I&#039;d get it.
&gt;&gt;2283104Apparently mining with low gb ram graphics cards will decrease performance as the blockchain becomes bigger.I don&#039;t know the details, but 3GB wouldn&#039;t be good future wise.
&gt;&gt;2283257I&#039;m currently using my existing 3gb 1060 and I&#039;m getting about the same hashrates that people have reported with the 6gb version.
&gt;&gt;2283303Yes, currently.Apparently as time goes on and it becomes harder to mine, 3GB vs 6GB will have performance differences.
&gt;&gt;2283377this is especially true with ethereum as daggerhasimoto is designed to use more memory than other miner to be ASIC resistant
&gt;&gt;2283257This applies only to ethereum as DAG size increases, and 3gb limit will be hit around april 2018, 4gb by september 2019 and it is very likely that by that time ethereum will be no longer mineable by gpus. There are plenty of other algos that do not use same DAG tech for mining, or are just not memory intensive at all so memory size is irrelevant.
&gt;&gt;2283528Will eth mining last until 2018-19. From reading their documentation they seem to imply a closer date. Perhaps the end of this year?
&gt;&gt;2283544Eth has anti-mining feature called ice age or difficulty bomb, by august this year block time will double and mining profits will be halved, we are already seeing the effects as average block time is currently 16.5s, and it used to be 15s until recently. However if price of eth doubles by summer the mining revenue will not change, so there&#039;s no real way of knowing when eth mining will stop being profitable, but I believe it&#039;s safe to say it will remain profitable until end of this year.
&gt;&gt;2283528&gt;will be no longer mineable by gpusuntil someone pays a ansic designer and a team with inside info to do more math and pass as gpus, gaining x200 what normal pcs will mine. profitable as fuck
&gt;&gt;2284351if devs wanted they could order dedicated ansic based on their algorithm....this is why ETH sucks in long term, not only +50% of coins in on holder, but the entire mining not open to everyone giving them the monopoly too. Consider the limiteless supply and you are fucked.

&gt;&gt;2284256double bottom... more like slow and agonizing death with small spikes of optimism followed by a dramatic slap to the nutsack...going down further until ultimately everybody starts jumping ship like rats.only those who invested at sub 500 sats will leave with anything substantial.
Wait ...Oops no digibytegaming.com still down, still a piece of shitcoin.
&gt;LAST CHANCE BEFORE IT GOES ON THE RUN TO 20K
&gt;&gt;2284125lol dumb bagholding faggot kys
&gt;buying in for almost 10x ICO days after no one what but whales bought invery stupid
&gt;&gt;2284148investment groups made up the big wallets, not individuals you dingus.Also I bought in for 6.5k yesterday sold for 11K.bought back in for 9.5k and sold again for 14K.Now I just bought back in for 11.5k and will sell again at 16/17K tonight.Couldn&#039;t give a shit about your fear of making money. Someone always gets in cheaper, doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t still room for gains pussy.
Swarm City will release Boardwalk on June 15th. Boardwalk is their Minimum Viable Product. Their first release was Terminal which is a wallet and is accesible right now on swarm.city, and their third release after Boardwalk will be Storefront (but you don&#039;t need to even think about that one yet, it&#039;s just good to know more is coming).Okay, so now that I got your attention, I don&#039;t think I have ever seen such good odds for a 10 bagger in such a short period of time.Not only will the devs at Swarm City release their unique platform (nobody else is doing what they are doing in crypto) in two weeks, they will also release a new website before the launch to actually give people an idea of what Swarm City is about.So let me give you a hint of what Swarm City is about: SC is a commerce meta-platform where anyone can create a hashtag like #needaride or #cash4btc (can be location specific). So whenever someone creates a hashtag they will become the de facto business owner of that hashtag, and people will be able to transact with eachother under that hashtag by making use of a smart contract (the hashtag creator/maintainer will be the arbiter and decides what % of the transaction to pay himself as fee). You also get reputation points for successfully completing transactions so you will know who to trust. So basically you could set up an Uber or localbitcoins type business up on Swarm City or any business that you could think of really and you don&#039;t have any regulation stuff to worry about because it is decentralized and impossible for a government to take down.If you go to their current website it&#039;s already clear the Swarm City team are great at marketing. This ain&#039;t no amateur show.What really makes the value proposition of this coin so good right now though is that it is totally under the radar because the website is so cryptic and nobody really understands what it is about. Not for long anymore.Thank me in two weeks for giving you the heads up /biz. I&#039;m all in.
This is how you value invest in crypto.Also good to know that on June 15th they will limit the platform to 1 hashtag #Pioneer. After a couple of days that limit will be lifted though and everybody will be able to create their own hashtags.
Interesting... how do you feels it compares to Bitbay&#039;s concept ?
&gt;Enabled by the SWT token, runningon the Ethereum blockchainzz
&gt;&gt;2267641ICO?
&gt;&gt;2267641noice and it&#039;s flat as fuck, totally premooned.
Or you can get dgb as we rocket from 2k to 10k sats. Why are investing in worthless shit?
the fuck kind of cryptocurrency name is swarm city
&gt;&gt;2267685Bitbay is an exchange. Swarm City will enable any type of business to operate, the use cases are only limited by the creativity of the users. And most of all you will be able to do it without some middle man snooping off 20% of your revenues.
&gt;&gt;2267691&gt;&gt;2267685Have you not realized by now everything is pumping like mad?Who cares just jump in the chart looks good.
INPicked up 100. Thx OP.
&gt;&gt;2267701No Swarm City has been in development for a year. The profits are going to be reaped on June 15th and nobody here is even aware.I predict the floodgates will burst once they release their improved site before June 15th.
Seems interesting OP, how do I buy?
&gt;&gt;2267727That&#039;s what makes Swarm City so good. It&#039;s not just some pump and dump scheme. It&#039;s a legit platform that actually has massive potential and I think it makes use of crypto that gives it unique advantage. Swarm City will be one of a kind, for now at least.
price looks good no pump yetwhere can we buy
&gt;&gt;2267641whats a good entrybelow 100k sat?
&gt;&gt;2267710In this thread we are value investing. If it doesn&#039;t hurt at least a little to buy in, you are doing it wrong.However unlike old school value investors, you don&#039;t have to sit for 2-3 years on your investment and hope the value will be recognized.We know what the catalyst is going to be that is going to unlock the value, and it is June 15th. You know it&#039;s priced it for the reasons that I mentioned in my original post and because it&#039;s obvious that 95-99% of people on this board have never even heard of Swarm City, and in the off chance that they did they have no clue what it&#039;s about.
&gt;&gt;2267788Correction: meant to say &quot;You know it&#039;s not priced in...&quot;
&gt;&gt;2267755Anywhere around 100k sats and you are gold in my opinion.This thing is going to go to the moon in two weeks so entry is not that important. What&#039;s important is that you are on the rocket before it takes off.
&gt;&gt;2267828had this in my top3-whats-next alreadygoing to get a nice stash!
Well I just googled into this, and this appears to be a project that rose from the ashes of arcade city coin which turned out to be some massive scam?Whats there to stop this just being scam again?And quite frankly the marketing so far has been rubbish, trying to even understand what the fuck this coin did was a pain, their bitcointalk thread is in shambles basically and barely explains a thing. The website is also a fucking shitshow that barely explains anything and runs like trash. so idk why you saying they are good at marketing, doesnt seem they have really tried yet which would make sense since the app is out yet.Havent finally understood wtf they are on about though it does seem like a great idea, seems suss though since it comes from arcade coin and they havent really shown off the application as functional yet except for one blockchain transfer test in a pretty poor gui?Unless im mistaken and they have somewhere shown off the app???
Why do I need a hashtag to trade under? Why wouldn&#039;t I create my own and trade under that for no fees? Why not just send the payment directly?This sounds like a normal wallet, but you add a referee tag to who you send a fee for each transaction.
&gt;&gt;2267850I think this will be the best &#039;I told you so&#039; of my life. There have been many ten baggers in crypto before, and there will be many after this. The difference here is that a 5x is virtually a sure thing and I estimate that a 10x happening in the next month has like odds of 80%.
&gt;&gt;2267944Because he&#039;s holding
If you don&#039;t know why this is a scam then you don&#039;t deserve to be rich.
&gt;&gt;2267944They rebranded from Arcade City to Swarm City and ousted the scammer CEO. The team right now is very solid and transparent. Visit the slack. Read their blog posts.Your opinion is exactly why this coin is going to do amazing. They are launching a new website in the coming 10-12 days to give people a better idea of what Swarm City is about + they will release their functional application June 15th. Again check the slack if you are curious to see what it will look like. But it will have all the functionality of the hashtags I described. They have been working on it for months.The next update after this is Storefront which will provide context dependent GUIs so you will be able to hook up the Swarm City API to any app and have the same experience as you would using Uber for example, while being totally decentralized and without having to pay any middle man.
&gt;&gt;2267991Does that stop this from being a buy the rumour sell the news scenario?
&gt;&gt;2267991Are you still going to mindlessly say it&#039;s a scam once they release Boardwalk and people are going to start using the platform?If you want to explain to me why you think it&#039;s a scam please do so. I&#039;m all ears.
&gt;&gt;2268007What do you mean not having to pay a middle man? In the OP itself&gt;the hashtag creator/maintainer will be the arbiter and decides what % of the transaction to pay himself as feeThere clearly is a middleman, the creator of the hashtag. In your example Uber would still take a cut of every transaction.So again, what makes this useful? Why pay extra to pay thru a hashtag, when you can pay without one even easier?
&gt;&gt;2267991From my basic research it seems to be the previous coin was run by a scumbag CEO that the team hated so they hardforked off it into swarm city, which does raise some suspicions but otherwise i cant find much to say its a scam coin, so give some reasoning as to why??&gt;&gt;2268007I&#039;ll go on slack and look around, holy fuck they need a new website the current one is complete trash.&gt;&gt;2268012If XRP can rise to its current prices, then any coin can lmao
I like the idea of the currency but it&#039;s so new and shady.Could go either way so I&#039;ll get maybe $40 and wait
We&#039;re off to the moon boys
&gt;&gt;2268058Uber takes a 20% fee. They have to because they have to pay for a lot of overhead costs.On Swarm City you are correct that a small % of the total transaction amount will go to the hashtag maintainer, but the only costs he has is playing the role of an arbiter which is necessary function. But the fee on every transaction will be max 2-3%.This is because you essentially have an environment of perfect competition where anyone can set up a hashtag and compete for the lowest % fee.What I mean by not having to pay a middle man is not paying for all the unnecessary overhead costs that are associated with normal businesses.
One of the reasons why their website is pretty shitty is because it runs completely client side, similar to MyEtherWallet. That&#039;s the trade-off you have with decentralized applications.But as I said they are working hard on a new website which should give people a better idea of what this is all about.
got in sub-100klets go boys!
So what&#039;s the ticker and where can i buy?
&gt;&gt;2268156SWTbittrex
&gt;&gt;2268156SWT on Bittrex or Shapeshift.Shapeshift does not accept scam coins by the way.
&gt;&gt;2267737You&#039;re welcome. All you have to do now is sit on your but and be patient until June 15th arrives.
Not really convinced desu senpai, I&#039;ll stick with Bitbay for now
&gt;&gt;2268104I agree their past was shady, but it was only related to one individual. The current team is pretty awesome.You can always wait of course. Just know that the big money is never made after the rocket has taken off. It is made before.
&gt;&gt;2268249Here, watch this senpai. I guarantee you will be sold on the concept.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xljDR4yDd4c
&gt;&gt;2267641And why are you telling us about this? What is your motive?
not sure if you&#039;re the same guy, but your thread and your writing-style in general reminds me about the last two shilling-threads, which made me actually buy something.these were RDD at 5sat and DGB at 113 Sat.Made a lot of money on those and I will ride this rocket now, too.thanks OP!
&gt;&gt;2268077Ok finished doing a bunch of research, going in with 250us most i can afford rn desu. OP isn&#039;t shitting this coin is pretty solid once you get a grasp on it, information is fucking disorganized though, check out the video below for things to actually be explained. Slack channels good to check out too, I like the old lady lmao&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xljDR4yDd4cHow the fuck did you even find this coin OP, feed me your ways so I may moon more often and never wagecuck again
&gt;&gt;2267641Project looks meh, website is meh, whitepaper is meh. ONly thing making me considering buying it is that the Master of Autismo aka Dmitriy Buterin, father of the autistic paradigm officially endorses Swarm City
&gt;&gt;2268605where&#039;s the whitepaper? i&#039;m trying to find it. there&#039;s only the &quot;convert arc to swt&quot; whitepaper which pertty much says nothing about what it actually is
&gt;&gt;2268376this
&gt;&gt;2268376My motive is spreading awareness. Also as I said I am all in so I have an interest in getting the word out. I have no more fiat to invest so there&#039;s no point anymore in keeping it quiet
&gt;&gt;2268428That was not me and believe it or not this is the first time I publish my investment thesis on /biz.That should tell you something.It means I&#039;m serious about this.
&gt;&gt;2268789&gt;you get reputation points for completing transactionswhat&#039;s stopping a guy from creating many fake accounts and transacting to himself to increase his reputation?
&gt;&gt;2268514Yeah there&#039;s a bunch of normies who follow Swarm City because they have crazy good on the ground marketing, and the product isn&#039;t even out yet. That should tell you this thing has actual potential to go mainstream.Also contrary to what some anon said here previously, I don&#039;t think their marketing is shit. It&#039;s very solid. They are doing all the right things like doing outreach on the ground/organizing events/interviews/new website/new marketing tools for the launch of Boardwalk. Also their spokesperson Mathew Carano is a master communicator. Once he does some more interviews/appearances and people get to know him I promise you they will 100% buy the vision they will flock to Swarm City.
&gt;&gt;2268789also, are new swt created? what is the rate of inflation
&gt;&gt;2268643They have a whitepaper but it is fairly outdated. They brand forked from Arcade City to Swarm City and broadened their mission from just making a ridesharing app to include all types of businesses.
&gt;&gt;2268850The inflation is 0%. There are a total of 9.5m SWT tokens. But some still have to be converted from ARC to SWT so in coinmarketcap you only see 6.5m SWT tokens.
&gt;&gt;2268846looking at their bitcointalk announcement, youtube, and website currently it is very shitty marketing. right now you have to do a lot of work just to find out what this thing is. it&#039;s a very interesting idea though
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL /BIZ ABOUT THIS FOR 3 DAY NOBODY LISTENS TO MEoh well get the fuck in here we meme this now. way better that digishit
&gt;&gt;2268840The same thing that stops someone from spamming the blockchain. Transaction fees.
bumpgtf in here /biz/
&gt;&gt;2268884Yes I agree. But what&#039;s the point of investing if everything is perfect? In 99 of 100 cases the price will already reflect that and you will be overpaying.What makes the value so great here is that Swarm City is actually a super solid concept once you get your head wrapped around it, right now you just have to do some serious digging to understand it. But this will change.Once they have their new website and Boardwalk ready by 15th June the hard to understand aspect will disappear and the super solid concept will be all that is left.Suddenly everybody is going to realize that this is an actual gem in crypto, and that is when the FOMO will start.So the point is that you are not investing in what it is now, but in what it will be in two weeks. And it will be great.
&gt;&gt;2268898will boardwalk offer a &quot;global&quot; hashtag e.g. for online work, it looks like it&#039;s just going to be geolocation based
&gt;&gt;2268988doesn&#039;t matter; will pump
&gt;&gt;2268988On June 15th you&#039;ll be limited to the #Pioneer hashtag. After that everyone is going to be able to set up their own hashtag. You will be able to choose yourself if you want the hashtag to be location based or not. For certain applications that makes sense, for others it doesn&#039;t.
ITS TIME TO STOP SHILLING DGB
&gt;&gt;2268605Having Dmitry Buterin as advisor is another data point which should solidify that this is not a &#039;scam.&#039;I agree 100% that the website and whitepaper are meh. The website is changing in 10-12 days and who cares about the whitepaper..The project is far from meh. Watch the video that is linked in this thread.
it still has a really low price compared to its overall total supply, it&#039;s fair to expect at least a 6x in the next weeks
&gt;&gt;2269293Imagine what will happen once the platform will actually gain traction...
&gt;&gt;2267641Where can I buy some of this shit? From a trusted exchange.
&gt;&gt;2269681bittrex
&gt;&gt;2269702Thanks. I could&#039;ve just read the thread, saw it earlier.
&gt;&gt;2269681Just saw this thread. Been in SWT for a while, and never saw this point mentioned. Right now the main exchange to buy from is Bittrex, but imagine the FOMO if Poloniex decides to add it? I&#039;m holding for that day, which I believe will come.
&gt;&gt;2269681You can find it on shapeshift too if you don&#039;t have a Bittrex account
i actually saw this token two days ago when i was checking the roi on recent icos. this has gone up over 3000% since then. i&#039;m in.
&gt;&gt;2270076Stratis has been out for literally one year and since then it did a 100,000% return.3000% is nothing.
&gt;&gt;2267641Good post OP
&gt;&gt;2267641It&#039;s already at a $20 million market cap though, it&#039;s one of the most popular altcoins (#80 on coinmarketcap). So how far up can it really go?I guess it doesn&#039;t have to go up 10x though, even just riding the hype is feasible, but still it&#039;s a risky game to play.
&gt;&gt;2270294if they don&#039;t fix their shitty website, ther&#039;s not gonna be any hype
&gt;&gt;2270200if you look at the stats you can clearly see stratis is an exceptional case. compared to everything that isn&#039;t stratis, 3000 is very good. that&#039;s 30x your initial investment.
&gt;&gt;2267641&gt;&gt;2267672&gt;&gt;2267725&gt;&gt;2267740&gt;&gt;2267751&gt;&gt;2267788&gt;&gt;2267795&gt;&gt;2267828&gt;&gt;2267964&gt;&gt;2268007&gt;&gt;2268022&gt;&gt;2268121&gt;&gt;2268149&gt;&gt;2268175&gt;&gt;2268245&gt;&gt;2268268&gt;&gt;2268283&gt;&gt;2268771&gt;&gt;2268789&gt;&gt;2268846&gt;&gt;2268860&gt;&gt;2268873&gt;&gt;2268898&gt;&gt;2268986&gt;&gt;2269023&gt;&gt;2269124&gt;&gt;2269375&gt;&gt;2269957&gt;&gt;2270200That&#039;s quite a lot of posts. Are you sure you&#039;re not shilling?
&gt;&gt;2270388It&#039;s coming before June 15th. Visit the slack and ask the team to confirm if you don&#039;t want to trust me.
&gt;&gt;2270294If Digibyte can go up to $350m and Waves can go up to $500, this can go to $200m easily. Remember the Swarm City platform will be the first thing in crypto that actually has unique and compelling use cases besides giving the DNMs a payment system and setting up ICOs.
Was reading about this yesterday and was planning to buy. Looks pretty undervalued. Just bought some now.
&gt;&gt;2270577If Uber alone can be worth 60 billion, there&#039;s a lot of upside here. It&#039;s actually mind boggling to think what this could become. I don&#039;t know if I should hold for $50 or $10,000 per token. We&#039;re at $3 right now.
&gt;&gt;2270390Yes, and that 30x is with a shitty website and without a useable product. Do you know what that signals? Belief and confidence in the team and the concept.Imagine what will happen if the broader crypto market gets wind of what Swarm City represents.They will see what I am seeing now. I am seeing it earlier because right now it requires work to understand the value. But this is only temporary.Once the new website is released and their product comes out, boom, the value is unlocked because suddenly it is recognizeable. These things move very fast too.Remember when Sia was trading at $20m not too long ago? Not many people here knew about it. Now pretty much every knows what Sia is about. Nothing has fundamentally changed about Sia since it was trading at $20m, but it still did a 15x since then. Once the price started to rise people actually took the effort to take a closer look. It turns out that all the while Sia was just a gem hidden in plain sight, just like Swarm City is now.Unlike in Sia&#039;s case though, here we have two clear catalysts which will unlock the value and wake the broader crypto scene up.The problem right now is that they haven&#039;t heard about it or that they don&#039;t know what it&#039;s about. After the new website and the platform are released, I will guarantee you that they will be sold on it.
&gt;&gt;2270462It&#039;s because I&#039;m passionate about this thing. Doesn&#039;t really matter if anyone thinks it&#039;s shilling. Just listen to the arguments and decide for yourself if you think it&#039;s worth something
I&#039;ve known about this way before even the first ICO for Arcade City. I never liked the Arcade City name. That was something Chris actually paid someone to come up with. When Chris left, the team decided on a new brand, Swarm City. I still consider it a kinda weird name, but since I know the history behind it, I&#039;m able to see what others do not see because they look at the name and think it sounds weird. That means I&#039;m going to be rich.
&gt;&gt;2270938Sadly I learned about it when it was trading in the low single digit millions and passed on it just like everyone else because I couldn&#039;t understand it. I only dug deeper once I saw it move up the ranks in coinmarketcap.
&gt;&gt;2270462Of course he&#039;s shilling. But he also thinks he&#039;s found literal gold, and the only way for that gold to be recognized is for others to see it as well.
&gt;&gt;2271166And they will
&gt;&gt;2271310Any crypto with good fundamentals will rise in a bull market, it is only a matter of time. I own golem and will hold till it hits 80 cents at least, and I will look into this. It would be dumb not to put part of your stack in this coin if it is actually good and you think this bull market continues (which it will.)
&gt;&gt;2271331Indeed. I&#039;m already on the phone with the Lamborghini dealership as we speak. They have me on hold, I&#039;m inquiring about what they&#039;ll have available in a few months. Being rich is going to be so nice.
&gt;&gt;2271166I don&#039;t know if you think this is something nefarious, but what you describe is literally how value investing works.You see the value before the market does and you either wait for the market to recognize it or you publicly publish your thesis and hope that it will accelerate price discovery.There&#039;s nothing wrong with this.
&gt;&gt;2271375I don&#039;t. I just want people here to understand, not everyone shilling is trying to get you to buy for his 30 minute long pump.I will be reading this thread tonight and putting in between 5-15% of my stack depending on how much I like it.People forget the eth shilling at $2. Everyone shilling it only had good intentions. I think a lot of people are gonna get burned on DGB and turn people off from anything being shilled, which is a damn shame.
&gt;&gt;2271401What makes you think a lot of people will get burned on DGB? Not trying to start anything im just genuinely curious.
&gt;&gt;2271464Most people vastly over value the fundamentals and don&#039;t understand it&#039;s being manipulated by whales.
&gt;&gt;2271401In that case, great to encounter another rational mind. To be honest, what continues to suprise me is how well many cryptos keep their value once they have been pumped.By the way, the thing that keeps me coming to /biz are threads like the one I created here. Even though there are many scams here, I believe biz was the first one to shill ethereum, then pivx, waves, sia, reddcoin, then digibyte. It&#039;s pretty impressive.
&gt;&gt;2271464Because there&#039;s literally nothing special about Digibyte and once Bitcoin adds Segwit and is bolted onto the Lightning Network, all of its benefits are made redundant.
&gt;&gt;2271401I remember the ETH shilling on here. I took note and now I&#039;m applying my wisdom by buying an undiscovered gem before it goes mainstream. I&#039;m smart. I love myself.
&gt;&gt;2271522that feel
How much does it cost to create a tag?Is is first-come first-serve?Is there a market-place for tags?Seems like there&#039;s going to be a run on good, short, tags like the domain name run
&gt;&gt;2271677Join the Slack and ask the devs. I&#039;m not going to do it because I don&#039;t want to reveal my anonimity.
&gt;&gt;2271819so you&#039;re shilling shit without even understanding the basics of how it works?
&gt;&gt;2271946Welcome to /biz/
&gt;&gt;2271946This thing is a work in progress mate. Pretty sure that what you&#039;re asking hasn&#039;t been decided yet. On June 15th the hashtags will be limited to #Pioneer. I imagine that there will be a run on hashtags after that, probably on a first come, first served basis.But because I&#039;m not entirely sure I implore you to ask the devs yourself.
&gt;&gt;2272039it&#039;s less than 2 wks from release, but fundamentals haven&#039;t been decided?they can&#039;t change this after release without nuking their credibilitythis smells like poorly managed toxic dog shit
&gt;&gt;2272309Here&#039;s the answer:&quot;anyone will be able to create, the community will decide which hashtags show up in the official swarm.city&quot;
&gt;&gt;2272309&gt;this smells like poorly managed toxic dog shitI love hearing opinions like these. Let&#039;s me know how early I am to invest. Same exact criticism was given to Bitcoin, and back then I believed the doubters way too much. Turns out, they don&#039;t know shit, they&#039;re just intellectually lazy faggots who suck at life!
&gt;&gt;2273160By the way I asked around and it turns out that there is a clear and very elegant plan. But it&#039;s kinda sensitive right now because there is a lot of economic value attached to this so they don&#039;t want to disclose the details yet because they don&#039;t want to change people&#039;s behaviour. Hint: it has something to do with reputation. If you don&#039;t trust my answer, ask the devs yourself.
it&#039;s not a cheap coin really is it? what are the legs on this? you mention 10x gains earlier and now you say here&gt;&gt;2273212&gt;Hint: it has something to do with reputation.are you suggesting this is tied to augur? how would you know that?
&gt;&gt;2273212You quoted the wrong person. I&#039;m onboard with SWT all the way. I&#039;ve been in the slack since the beginning and seen that they are a team that thinks thinks through very carefully. This is definitely not some fly by night shitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2273249No it has nothing to do with other coins. Remember how I said that you gain reputation in Swarm City by successfully completing transactions? People will be able to vote with their reputations which hashtags show up in the official swarm.city
&gt;&gt;2270732$50 is very reasonable. For $10,000 I think they are 5 years to early. I think there are currently still too much problems with fiat/crypto conversion to really make this go mainstream beyond the crypto space, but I could be wrong. I&#039;m sure there are lots of brilliant brains working on solutions right now.
so where do i buy
&gt;&gt;2273632Bittrex or Shapeshift
&gt;&gt;2273477Yup, but a real application like this is exactly where fixing those problems begins. That&#039;s pretty much why Dmitry Buterin is an advisor, imo.&gt;&gt;2273632Bittrex.
Thanks OP. Finally a good shilling thread with actual explanation of the fundamentals. I filled my bags
&gt;&gt;2273755Glad to hear my shilling was appreciated. Be patient now though. I guarantee that if you hold this coin for 10-12 more days you will remember me and this thread.You guys are lucky I only have so much fiat and having nothing to lose by disclosing this golden opportunity
lol look at faggot OP desperately trying to lie about it not being a scam.If you buy this coin you&#039;re fucking retarded and deserve to lose money. Anyone shilling THIS hard is a liar.
&gt;&gt;2273885I&#039;m shilling THIS hard because I&#039;m all in so I finished buying and because I like giving my biz bros the opportunity to profit because biz has given me several profitable opportunities in the past + it simply makes me feel good. Don&#039;t give a shit that it comes off as shilling.If you think this is a scam, I&#039;m all ears and willing to hear your arguments. Actually I would be very grateful because you&#039;d obviously save me a lot of money if you told me something I didn&#039;t know yet.But I suspect you don&#039;t have any evidence because I did pretty extensive due diligence.
&gt;&gt;2273885Go back to your shitcoin threads, you sad clown.

you should have posted something like thishttps://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-boardwalk-overview-9a362f19411fit&#039;s long but interesting, this is actually pretty great and looks slick. the only downside and limit to adoption is, like the other anon said, the inevitable bullshit that you have to deal with trying to buy, store, and sell crypto. but that aside, this looks great.
&gt;&gt;2274870I read that earlier today. It&#039;s actually genius in how simple but how necessary it is to everyday life. It&#039;s basically something like Craigslist except with escrow so you&#039;re less likely to get fucked. Plus users define all the tags themselves AND it&#039;s still a cryptocurrency, so there&#039;s endless flexibility in the (shady) business you can conduct. I plan on HODLing this for a long time. For once it&#039;s a coin I actually believe in the application it has.
https://press.swarm.city/embracing-more-diversity-and-getting-organised-swarm-2-0-59115c80101eYeah nah, this is absolute trash written by a bunch of SJWs who program primarily in javascript but cant even make a decent fucking website.
&gt;&gt;2275065you can tell from their logos, the website style, and their videos that this is going for an instagram type audience, i&#039;m not sure how much money there is to be made from stormfront tokens.
&gt;&gt;2274995Yep couldn&#039;t have worded it better myself&gt;&gt;2275065I&#039;m not at all convinced this is a SJW fest. It&#039;s more like a libertarian/ancap fest. Besides who cares, we are trying to make money here. Also, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit are all SJW infested and guess what? They are all successful platforms.The guy who wrote that diversity article is like that guy who is constantly brainstorming and comming up with awkward connections, every project has a dude like that. Who cares.The two programmers actually seem like they are bros.As I said they will release a new website soon. This is going to be a real catalyst. Remember one of the reasons the site is a bit shitty is because it runs a decentralized app entirely on the client side similar to MyEtherWallet. That&#039;s not some easy javascript stuff.
&gt;&gt;2268514Why does the spokesperson look like someone just beat the shit out of him?
&gt;&gt;2275412DGB shills didn&#039;t want him showing off an actually good coin
&gt;&gt;2267753i just bought a little on bittrex. now im thinking I should buy a lil more.
&gt;&gt;2268846&gt;Mathew CaranoEnjoy your visit to 4chan, Mat?
&gt;25, 50, 75 125, 225this bot has been there all day selling this shit
&gt;&gt;2275412Shut up, nigger.
OP, It seems very interesting by the way you described, however, I have to say that their web page lacks clear information about what they are trying to do. By reading, it doesn&#039;t look that different from the hundreds of other alts out there.I&#039;m saying this is a bad thing because people who stumble across this coin will not know what you are telling us, they will dismiss It as just a copy pasted shitcoin. They need to do a better jon at explaining what the project is about. Not to mention the page is slow.
&gt;&gt;2277028But isn&#039;t that good for you because while most will pass on it, you will accumulate at really low prices? Anyone who does their proper research will know that a new website is coming, and everything is on the up and up. That&#039;s how investing early works.
&gt;&gt;2277028Looks like decentralized craigslist to me mate, very normie friendly. Potential to go high if it takes off, the token is also a key part of it too.Normies LOVE hashtags, reputation, connecting eachother, trusted transactions in escrow, all that shit they can piss around with on their phones. Some bitch will sit and make a #IKnitThings tag, and other bitches will join in and sell/buy their random shite etc.If they get a good enough app / ui and so on, and have that obscure all the blockchain bollocks, it could take off pretty well.
&gt;&gt;2270462
&gt;&gt;2274995That is a really great idea once you explain it that way. If they can get it into the app store and advertise to the right people, it could become really popular.
&gt;&gt;2267641The investment here is into a website or &quot;platform&quot;? Not a tech value investment but rather the idea to create the next craigslist with a crypto - like silkroad but marketed at normies? Not saying it cant work just curious what the sell is since the website wasn&#039;t very helpful.
But just how viable are we talkin here? What have they said in reference to the biggest problem facing normies and crypto today? (That being the actual entry/initial purchase of the coin)Has anyone read how they will handle actually transacting the coins into real money? For us /biz/raelis its pretty simple since we&#039;ll just throw that shit to an exchange and swap it out, but for a normie, how are they going to handle turning SWT into cold hard cash?
&gt;&gt;2277569i spent a few horus looking around. it is a platform where you can create marketplaces. a hashtag is a specific marketplace. you can make a request to buy something on a hashtag and people who sell the service/product will reply to you. then the buyer can choose to chat with the seller and arrange a deal. once a deal is struck, you both will put up money in an escrow. when the deal is finished, both your reputation points will go up.
is there a slack chat or discord i can hop into? Seems sick.
&gt;&gt;2277585they&#039;re not working on that right now. they probably don&#039;t have to do anything and just wait for the exchanges to offer it
&gt;&gt;2277606Thx anon, I like the idea but dont see this one in particular going newhere.
&gt;&gt;2277641i&#039;m iffy on this too. i think it will depend on how good their mobile apps are
&gt;&gt;2277606Yeah, this sounds convoluted as fuck. No normie will use this. Also, OP has like 100 posts out of the 145 in here, so fuck this shit. Sage!
&gt;&gt;2277606This sounds like it COULD have huge potential. How does a swarm &quot;coin&quot; work then?
&gt;&gt;2277797it&#039;s the money that is used on the platform. i&#039;m not sure why they even need a separate coin
&gt;&gt;2277223Indeed. I definitely see this as being the next &quot;general service&quot; buying thread.Imagine tons of normies downloading it just to see what it has to offer, and then get interested in the coin. I just threw 500$ at 115k yesterday
&gt;&gt;2277953i meant buying app/website*
&gt;&gt;2277797swarm coins work by swarming all over these gains with BEANCOIN!
&gt;&gt;2277706When Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin as they promised to do if Prop 1 passed requiring fingerprints for drivers, Arcade City started promoting the #needarideatx hashtag on Facebook. It was very popular and proved that people will transact with each other over a hashtag.
&gt;&gt;2277829&gt;i&#039;m not sure why they even need a separate coinno one will use they system, so how else are the devs supposed to scam money?
How much will i get paid per tag
I love how every coin claims to be the first ever decentralized XThen another comes and say we are the first really decentralized XThen the day after that another comes and says we are the first TRULY decentralized XThis is a big redflag, this bubble is getting saturated and ready to burst.
&gt;&gt;2278651No, I&#039;m not going to sell my coins to you.
Will users have to purchase SWT to spend in the app, or can they plug in their credit card info to make instant purchases with FIAT in the app?
&gt;&gt;2278935Someone answer this man
&gt;&gt;2278935This is essentially the question I asked here -&gt;&gt;2277585If they plan to use the coin, then someone would have to buy the coin before using it, so reasonably, a normie would have to use cash to buy the coin. But from where I&#039;m sitting that just sounds like extra unneeded steps in the eyes of a normal-fag who doesnt give a single dick about &quot;New-Age Currency&quot;.They&#039;ll just see it as microtransactions, and having to essentially purchase the Swarm-City version of an in-game currency.So unless they were backing all of their tokens with the cash themselves, the whole process just seems too convoluted to actually work.
&gt;&gt;2278997Agreed. I really like the marketplace idea, in theory this could make uber/ airbnb/ craigslist obsolete by putting it all in one place.If you have to deposit money into the app tokens before being able to trade then im 100% out. That is a dealbreaker. I&#039;m not going to put $100 dollars into an app because I might need a ride sometime soon. I want to put money in when I actually want to pay for something.
&gt;&gt;2275412Have some respect anon. He&#039;s a good dude.&gt;&gt;2277585&gt;&gt;2277619I share you concernes and so do the Swarm City people. They are highly aware that fiat/SWT conversion will be a painpoint and they are working on solutions. They wrote up an article about it a couple of days ago.https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-business-hive-update-31-05-2017-998c14c5a6c3So how I imagine it is that all the early adopters of Swarm City will come from the crypto scene and that gradually more mainstream people will join. By the way he Dark Net Markets are pretty huge and plenty of normies have learned how to buy bitcoins so it&#039;s not like this will be the end of the world. But as you read they are keenly aware of the problem and they are working on solutions. What more could you ask for?&gt;&gt;2277614Yeah there is a slack and it&#039;s full of friendly people. Visit swarm.city and click the slack link.&gt;&gt;2277663The mobile apps will come with their third release Storefront. Remember this thing is decentralized and open source so anyone could develop a mobile app if they wanted to do.&gt;&gt;2277829To make us rich anon&gt;&gt;2278185You set your own prices. The hastag owner asks a small fee because he plays the role of the arbiter. You can create your own hashtag too if you want.&gt;&gt;2278651This is not the 1000th coin promising to revolutionize the payment system. This is a commerce meta-platform. 100% unique in crypto. It&#039;s like a decentralized craigslist with hashtags and reputation built for normies.&gt;&gt;2278935&gt;&gt;2278997See above and read https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-business-hive-update-31-05-2017-998c14c5a6c3The answer is they are working on it but for the time being you&#039;ll have to face some hurdles. But hey crypto doesn&#039;t go mainstream from one day to another. It takes time to develop solutions.
&gt;&gt;2267962Because hashtags are a way to organize buyers and sellers into different hubs. The reputation you get for successfully completing transactions is hashtag dependent. Context matters. Someone who is good at ridesharing might not be the best person to provide you a cooking service for example.You can always create your own hashtag but you&#039;ll have attract buyers and sellers, and most of them are going to be concentrated within the established and popualr hashtags so it&#039;s a pure competition for who can provide the best experience basically..
&gt;&gt;2279341&gt;To make us rich anonBut really though, is there a clear reason as to why there even is a token? Sorry if I&#039;m being dumb here
&gt;&gt;2279777Because there is a need to have economic incentives of participants in the platform aligned, and to eventually insulate the community from value fluctuations of other currencies.I basically see SWT as a way to make the platform sticky. SWT incentivizes the participants to be invested in the success of the ecosystem because the value of SWT is closely linked to its success.If we would just use ETH that kind of incentive disappears.
Damn i&#039;m so happy I bought into this yesterday. THANKS OP
&gt;&gt;2268937&gt;buying at ATHyeah how about you go and fuck your self?
&gt;&gt;2267641thanks for shilling this meme coin op
&gt;&gt;2280062&gt;not buying at ATHBitcoin&#039;s ATH once was $0.1, then $1, then $10, etc...Following your genius advice would have caused you to miss every train in the last year senpai
&gt;&gt;2280018&gt;&gt;2280072Now be patient bros. Nothing has happened yet. Once the two catalysts I talked about take place, only then will the price start to reflect the real value.
This is only the beginning, it&#039;s going to moon in value soon
&gt;&gt;2280274Yea, within a few months.. Not today.
&gt;&gt;2280279SWT is highly illiquid right now. The price is extremely easy to manipulate. That&#039;s why we&#039;re waiting for the new site and the release of Boardwalk. That&#039;s when the big guys with the big volume will start coming in.In the meantime you will need to exercise some patience though. June 15th is still 11 days from now. But the new website will be released before that.
That website tho.
&gt;&gt;2280324Oh I&#039;m very patient. Just letting everyone know we&#039;re not there yet. We&#039;ll see volatility till the epic mooning occurs and leaves all the dumb fucks behind, where they belong. Right now I&#039;m surviving on a very shitty income until then, but I&#039;ll be able make it to the finish line, that&#039;s all that matters.
A little bump, now dead in the water. nice shilling anon
&gt;&gt;2267641Oh damn I only have a few eth. It&#039;s either swarm city or Bancor ICO for me. Which one has higher gain potential ?
&gt;&gt;2280987diversify
&gt;&gt;2281001I don&#039;t have enough to. I want to go all on one of them since they both look incredible solid/safe
&gt;&gt;2268514ya that got me, I just went all in after looking at the market capwhy did none of you faggots tell me about this ico?
Why is the guy with the bot selling?
&gt;&gt;2281534don&#039;t know, his loss my gain I hope Tass really does nuke the fucking bittrex bots 99% of the time they are annoying as hell this one time is a VERY rare exception
&gt;&gt;2281534&gt;every transaction has a buyer and a seller&gt;so there&#039;s always someone buying and someone selling&gt;there&#039;s only one reason for buying but there are many reasons for selling&gt;I have no clue what the answer to your question is
&gt;&gt;2281596ayy fuck i&#039;m gonna throw a couple hundred on this
Just bought some, I&#039;ll probably dump June 14th.
&gt;&gt;2282099
Am I too late to buy?
&gt;&gt;2282826I think there will be a mini-crash by tomorrow and then we will see steady increase until the 14th when it will moon. It will crash around the 15th, and who knows what will happen after that.
I&#039;m in a lot of coin Slacks and this one has the most people, how did biz miss this ?All in boyos, looking at lambo colors https://swarmcity.slack.com
&gt;&gt;2282841Indeed, they have VITALIK&#039;S DAD on their advisory board.The talk about &quot;Diversity&quot; and other normie shit is great. Think now, SC, Strat, all these other coins appeal great to business (yay shekels), however their reach is still limited.Swarm will appeal to ALL hipsters with the instagram, rep points, hashtagging faggot ways, AND some of the general public who just want to buy and sell shit.You&#039;ll have mums selling cakes or knitting or god know&#039;s what, UBER style random taxi dudes selling rides (and pubbies buying), punters soliciting prostitutes, families trading second hand furnature, the lot. Like the dude said, decentralised craigslist.There&#039;s a lot of potential here, a LOT of kinks to work out, marketing to sort, and the whole thing hangs on how they handle currency, and having a VERY simple UI in their app that focuses on simplicity and trendy shit, and obscures all the blockchain bollocks.June 15th-20th will be telling, but this coin I actually have a lot of hope for. ETH, SC and the rest I have good long term hope, but this one could really explode if it successfully gets normies on board.

Ey boys, so I already have a few thousand in BTC and ETH and was never really interested in altcoins, but I think I should for sure put at least a thousand into altcoins just incase.Which coins should I buy for year+ hodls? Long term coins that could be the next ETHRight now I only have money in WAVES
Planning on holding STRAT for the year. Hope it does well
&gt;&gt;2284068ARK, check out the meme triangle on bittrex
&gt;&gt;2284068gnt and ark are my long holds
ANT, ARK, SIA
&gt;&gt;2284107I forward this.

whats long term in this crypto market?
I thought I&#039;d try to gain some quick gains by diversifying my portfolio, so invested in some of these coins. Bought dgb @ 1780 and invested in some other coins than eth for a change.Problem is, I have an exam in two days and I&#039;m spazzing like an autistic fuck, checking my blockfolio every other minute.Rate my coins please. I&#039;m thinking about just selling DGB @ a slight profit for my peace of mind and hold btc until exams are over (I know, weak hands). It feels like I have put too many of my eggs in the DGB and Stratis basket.
Buying high and selling low, you are a good fit for /biz/ !
You don&#039;t have to diversify so much with only 200$, this is only for bigger amounts. Just hold, wait and study for your exams.
&gt;&gt;2283887Exactly... The ppl on here that buy on ath&#039;s... it&#039;s amazing.
Buy high, get high and buy.
&gt;&gt;2283895What are the chances of DGB imploding within the next 48 hours?&gt;&gt;2283887&gt;&gt;2283923&gt;&gt;2283943Tbh I bought DGB at a dip, same goes for XBY, Waves and Ark. They just dipped even more in the past 24 hours. Usually I do a more research, but the FOMO kicked in.
&gt;&gt;2284008The next 12 hours for DGB are crucial. If it falls even lower, then DGB is probably over.If you see it getting up again, this coin is ready to go for some time.
&gt;&gt;2284040It just feels a little surreal desu. I&#039;ve seen these DGB threads for the past few weeks and just hid them usually, and all of a sudden it moons. It seems too big for a pump and dump, but I&#039;m starting to lose faith just by looking at the charts.Ah well, I guess I&#039;ll just hodl.
Been trading DGB a lot this weekend. Originally I thought &lt;1800 was a great buy but now it&#039;s sunday and the chart is starting to turn down. Be very careful with DGB anon.
does this mean it&#039;s time to get the fuck out?
&gt;&gt;2283440Yes.
Coin?
looks like order book for $bat
Is this BAT?
&gt;&gt;2283440means it&#039;s already too late moran.
Their browser sucks and they&#039;re trying to push Google and Facebook aside? I shat on Bat.
&gt;sell BAT&gt;Before polo releasenever gonna make it
not necessarily. BAT has only bee on the exchange less than 24 hrs, so that&#039;&#039;s kind of skewed. Look at the market history, still tons of big buy orders coming in. I&#039;m holding.
&gt;&gt;2283488Looked just like that 6 hours ago before it took off lol. Let the whales sell off their shares
Is this batcoin?
yes its bat
&gt;&gt;2283613when it will hit polo? i want to dump it already and sleep
&gt;&gt;2283440I&#039;m not selling you cheap BAT, faggot.
&gt;&gt;2284054bumpppppp
hey biz friends!i have a new business idea.im thinking of paying a few nasty girls minimum wage and then hiring them out by the hour......a new form of &#039;pimping&#039; if you will.not sure how much to charge, was thinking maybe 200 bucks for an hour....NO BUM FUN THOUGH!
&gt;&gt;2283576please do not post here ever again
Woah, good job, you just invented prostitution.
&gt;&gt;2283840dont be silly that would be illegal....its a form of pimping (legal).do you think 200 is about right?higher if they are clean (they&#039;re not)
Dude stop fucking namefagging and never post here until you do

&gt;&gt;2284167any reason for this rally or just the normal lambo mission continuing?
Do you think we can pump and dump a low market cap coin together /biz/? We can use Discord to plan it and dump it together. Spread the world that it&#039;s pumping hard and get Redditors and retards to hop on it.Let&#039;s get rich together.
&gt;&gt;2284089&gt;doing anything coordinated with /biz/cuitsno
&gt;&gt;2284089There&#039;s MOON for that.
/biz/ is too poor
&gt;I made just 700$ in this entire bull market. I&#039;m so pissed.After this it&#039;s back to me buying every stagnating coin ever and being thankful for even a 50% gain.
State your portfolio amount. Go

Worth 19k right now. Started with 5k and all I can do is say thank you to whoever came and shilled it on /pol/. I remember he said &quot;last chance to buy ETH &lt;$50&quot; and I&#039;m so glad I listened.
&gt;&gt;2283644better: rent out 2 rooms in your appartment for x months and invest everything in crypto

Byteball is giving away free bytes to BTC owners and also to current byte holders.https://byteball.org/&gt;In the 6th round, which is scheduled for the full moon of June (June 9, 2017 at 13:10 UTC), we&#039;ll distribute 62.5 MB for each 1 BTC of linked balance and 0.2 new byte for each 1 byte you already hold.I&#039;m no expert but it seems like it could be a decent coin. It&#039;s based on directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than blockchain, which avoids the scaling problems of blockchain. Also seems to have private transactions.In any case, it&#039;s free, so why not grab some? Just helping out my fellow /biz/bros.
&gt;&gt;2284189ok guys,let&#039;s pool our btc together into one wallet, get free byteball, then send the btc to our other wallets and get free gainssend to me first and I&#039;ll swap it in order of who sends ;)

When will the great global financial collapse happen and why do you think so?

&gt;&gt;2282481I can legit see this happening in the near futurethanks &quot;economic nationalism&quot;
&gt;&gt;2282481YES
&gt;&gt;2282437And when will they do so?Is the whole reason just Jews becoming even richer or are there also other reasons?
&gt;&gt;2282481What do you mean by this? And why should the USD be abandoned?
&gt;&gt;2282481This.It&#039;s going to be the like the 1600-1700&#039;s all over again but this time with much better weapons.BRICS will win in the end the US is going to make a hell of a mess in the process.
&gt;&gt;2282546I think so too.US is still sucking up the best brains in the world but is quickly collapsing from within. You can&#039;t keep immigration up but then throw your own people on the backburner. Those carriers are gonna be pacifying california before fucking with BRICS
&gt;&gt;2282481Some of you guys are alright. Don&#039;t go to the south china sea tomorrow.
&gt;&gt;2282592&gt;US is still sucking up the best brains in the worldI hear many are moving to Canada
&gt;&gt;2282607What the hell are they going to do in Canada? Retire?
&gt;&gt;2282622Presumably work and build up their wealth there.
&gt;&gt;2282592Just wait until they manage to throw Trump out of office, might finally get our white riots
&gt;&gt;2282546Most of those countries have issues far worse than the US. I don&#039;t think any sides going to win. Just going to be a slow grind into poverty for the whole world.
&gt;&gt;2282635No business opportunities in moose land
&gt;&gt;2282704By &quot;win&quot; I mean dethrone the USD as the global reserve. It&#039;s going to be a clusterfuck but the US will get the worst of it and go full post-USSR Russia.
&gt;&gt;2282761Lets see:Brazil: Massive poverty, corruption, unemployment, and crime, but great natural resources and strategic location.Russia: Constant bickering with developed countries, and top-to-bottom mafia culture, but improving balance sheets, military, and relations with developing nations.India: Massive poverty, unemployment, sexism/rape, but improving economy, disciplined workforce.China: Aging workforce, corruption, stalling economy, saber rattling with neighbors, but wealth of resources, strong propaganda control over population, and improving diplomacy.South Africa: Racial tensions and riots, corruption, unemployment, and crime, but wealth of natural resources and among (if not the top) most developed country in Africa.I can only see Russia and India coming out on top in a major conflict. The others are too unstable domestically and I can&#039;t see their population willingly accept incredible suffering for a vague idea of patriotism (maybe China actually). I was reading that historically (pre-1700s) India and China produced 51% of world GDP. They currently have 40% of world pop and have good technical abilities, so that sounds achievable even now.Given that, my overall assessment is that some combination of those 5 countries will overtake the US and we&#039;ll fade away as the top world power. Maybe S China Sea disputes will ignite the whole pacific region and in the chaos Russia will make some plays pissing of W Europe and we&#039;ll get WWIII. I hope not since we gotz nukes now, but war is constant throughout history so I&#039;m not optimistic. I&#039;m spitballing though so I&#039;d appreciate any corrections/additions from kind anons.
&gt;&gt;2282666Your poast gave me a spontaneous orgasm. Thanks, anon!
Warren Buffet finds Recessions to actually be a good thing. Prices dip, low risk. BUY BUY BUY
&gt;&gt;2282509Who is this psycho pajeet spamming like a SQL query all over /biz/?
I&#039;m just gonna buy the GLOBAL FUCKING DIPhere is my plan:- accumulate cryptos.- since bitcoin is virtual gold once recession hits, cryptos will skyrocket- as blood runs in the streets and investors are an heroing all over I will start selling cryptos and buying the FUKKIING GLOBAL DIPI will buy as much as I fucking can.Then everything will get back to normal within 5-10 years and I will be fucking rich as fuck.Is my plan solid?
&gt;&gt;2283660no if the actual markets die completly, without purchasing power from clients, a bussiness loses its breaththe financial crisis is not going to be just a spook, but a permanent change where lot of agents go broke and lots of people lose their wealth and income&#039;s valuestuff and people will be cheap, that&#039;s for sure, turning to 3rd world does that
&gt;&gt;2283698I think he might be some kind of SE asian. I wish I could at least understand what his argument is. As far as I can tell, &#039;bitcoin&#039;s great for billionaires who want to sugardaddy their underage gfs.&#039;
&gt;&gt;2283727The trick is having the skill/luck to executeYour plan is every thinking persons plan
&gt;&gt;2283727Agreed.
&gt;&gt;2283727There wont be a Global dip, as certain countries economies hit the shitter it will create surges in the cryptosphereGlobally people will be waiting to pick up cheap bags, do the maths
&gt;&gt;2283727your plan looks good, you just need to have zen master patience and discipline
&gt;&gt;2283730So you&#039;re talking about a radical extreme that probably isn&#039;t going to happen?... Especially with out new president.
&gt;&gt;2283727&gt;Then everything will get back to normal within 5-10 years&gt;He thinks things will go back to normal after the next crash
&gt;&gt;2283932&gt;He thinks things will go back to normal after the next crash&gt;He things &quot;this time its different&quot; and it won&#039;tPic related
&gt;&gt;2283730What people don&#039;t get is the stock market was never designed for normies, when America eliminated pensions for 401ks all it was doing was creating a new massive bubble of dumb money to be injected willy nilly and played with by greedy bankers.
&gt;&gt;2283727I&#039;m gonna buy my whole neighborhood at a discount as my neighbors get foreclosed on.

&gt;&gt;2283489Holy shit did no one actually read his fucking post he linked to?Slashing conditions are autonomus, and it basically means this:To roll back the blockchain you have to spend a mountain of Eth, so much so that the only good reason to ever roll back the blockchain is to save a bunch of people Eth because they lost it to something stupid, like a malfunctioning smart contract that just took trillions of dollars in eth out of circulation.Vitalik doesnt control that.It just means part of Casper is people can rewind the chain if over 66% of the stakers agree, but rolling back the chain costs a mountain of Eth, such that a 51% attack isn&#039;t worthwhile because the amount of eth you need to spend to roll back will be more than the amount of eth you can gain.Thats all there is to it.Thus if you try and do a 51% attack you just lose your eth.
Nothing centralized about it; it&#039;s a mostly (and often fully) automated process. Seehttps://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/minimal-slashing-conditions-20f0b500fc6c

Yo /biz/,Question for crypto oldfags. When the DAO hack happened and there was a hard fork that resulted in two cryptocurrencies emerging from what used to be a single one, how was this actually reflected in the wallets of people holding the original currency?Obviously, Ethereum Classic just continued the blockchain so everything stayed the same with that and 1 ETH that was in your wallet pre DAO was now just called 1 ETC.What I&#039;m confused about was how people became holders of the new ETH?When the hard fork happened did wallet holders get to decide whether they wanted to keep their balance in ETC or ETH or how the fuck did this work?
Your private key would work on both and hold the same quantity on both
Split it 50/50 i should sue for all the lost gains
&gt;&gt;2283934This.My eth was on polo at the time I think, they actually fixed it for you so that you got both.
Wait so, it was split 50/50? If you had 1 ETH pre DAO then post DAO you had .5 ETC and .5 ETH?
&gt;&gt;2283998Yes
&gt;&gt;2283998Really, shouldn&#039;t you of had the same amount as you started with? They were duplicate chains after all.
&gt;&gt;2284084this, the other anon is bamboozling you
&gt;&gt;2283998No, you got 1 ETH and 1 ETC for each pre-fork coin.
Thoughts on PEPECASH?Seems relatively lowkey other than Fred Wilsons bump a few weeks ago.
pepecash is amazing. A great long hold.Now is a good time to buy since we&#039;re on a downtrend. It will reverse eventually. When the game comes out, Pepe Party, its moon time
Large quantities of Mooncoin is being bought up on Bleutrade right now.The 3 sat wall has been weakening all day, and the 1-2 sat buy walls have been growing.Are we getting close to liftoff? Are we about to moon?
&gt;he fell for the mooncoin meme
&gt;&gt;2282649I haven&#039;t put much into it, but if it moons it would be pretty comfy.It&#039;s a gamble, but i would kill myself if i sold now at 3 sats and it moons to 100 sats later.I am not saying invest any huge sums into it but putting a little bit into memecoins is pretty fun.
Everyone will dump again at 4 or 5 sat and the cycle will begin again from 1.
&gt;&gt;2282866Possible, but if we could meme this coin onto bigger exchanges like bittrex i think it could moon for real.
&gt;&gt;2282616hahaha it&#039;s funny that someone actually took the time to make that picture. Bought 86,000,000 moon though.
&gt;&gt;2282913I am sitting at a measly 1 million myself.Not much but if it truly moons it will be enough.
im out at 300% gainsfuck this shitcoin desu, im done holding it, one dev is not enough to shill it properly
I made 4x my stake on this coin. But it is a quintessential shit-coin, has no novel idea behind it and Jo new tech whatsoever.Zero fundamental value besides a pump vehicle. I was there in the first thread where somebody pointed out its potential as a 1sat dormant coin for pumping.
&gt;&gt;2283098&gt;&gt;2283122You guys may be right, it does seem like it is getting pumped pretty hard right now.The question is when will they dump?
15,000 coins. What the fuck is 3 sat? What is a sat?This is my first time buying a memecoin, did I get keked?
I got a bunch in at 2 and out at 4 with initial+20%still holding a few millie for shits n gigs in case it goes to ten+
&gt;&gt;2283219yea sell at 4 if you can, or yous 2/3 of your money
Not buying Solar coin SLR right now anonwhy aim for the moon when you can aim for the sun
&gt;&gt;2283219A sat is the lowest possible fraction of a bitcoinso 0.00000003 (current mooncoin price) would be 3 sat.If it goes up to 0.00000006 (6 sats) you will have doubled your money.Mooncoin is a bit of a meme though so no one is sure if it will go back down to 1 sat or moon up to 10+ sats.Memecoins like this are high risk high return.
&gt;&gt;2283207either now after 3sat wall or anywhere between 5 - 10 in week or twofeels good to not have those bags though
&gt;&gt;2283381I am only holding a very small bag (more like a pouch) containing 1 million MOON.I don&#039;t mind holding it, i think we can get to 10+, and if we don&#039;t, no big deal.
&gt;&gt;2283310Wew thanks ladI bought at .00000015 so I&#039;ve doubled already. I know it&#039;s not much in profit at all.Might hold on to it for a few days see where it goes.
&gt;&gt;2283470Sorry lad but you might have autism,.00000015 would be 15 sats.You probably bought for less unless your autism is really advanced.
&gt;&gt;2283470You wanna buy my mooncoins for 15 sat aswell? You know what, discount price for 14 sat for my new friend :)
&gt;&gt;2283470&gt;buying moon without even knowing what a sat isMADMAN

&gt;&gt;2282616Wtf is going on with this chart
&gt;&gt;2283310Is my app fucked up? Mooncoin looks way higher for me.

Ok men, i want to start out trading coins.I just made a coinbase account, but at the moment should I be buying BTC, LTC or ETH?
BitBean
&gt;&gt;2280946You buy BTC and send it to exchanges to trade for altcoins. LTC and ETH will probably see large gains within the next month.So it depends, do you want to trade on an exchange or just hold and sell on coinbase later?
Buy BTC. Send to personal wallet and then to poloniex, bitfinex, etc.Then buy EXP, the buy the lambo.And inform yourself from sources other than only here
&gt;&gt;2280963&gt;&gt;2280966Yes, the point is to start trading altcoins. Thanks
Buy LTC, send it to an exchange, convert it to BTC and then buy. The reason for this is that ltc has a transaction fee of $.02 while BTC is $2. BTC also takes awhile to confirm..
&gt;&gt;2282064Yup, LTC has faster/lower confirmations and less fees.
&gt;&gt;2280946Buy Reddcoin on the dip, get in cheap before it&#039;s too late. I&#039;m sitting pretty on 100k RDD with 1000%+ gainz
&gt;&gt;2280966&gt;EXPliteral trash

&gt;&gt;2280946take 25% and buy BTC, 25% LTC, 25% ETHhold long termthen take the last 25% and buy more LTC, to send to poloniex so you can trade the meme pump and dump of the week
Don&#039;t buy LTC it&#039;s garbageYou might as well throw your fiat money out the window at passers by and ask them to hold onto it for you while it gathers interest via inflation
&gt;&gt;2282778hodl gives many rewards to those with strong hands.
&gt;&gt;2280946Reddcoin (RDD).It&#039;s a Proof of Stake Velocity coin (5% interest on staking, no mining) so the total pool will only increase gradually.It has real devs, and when Redd-ID launches it will be THE crypto used on social media sites for micro-tipping.Just broke 100 sats last night, and was at 120 in 5 minutes. It had been at 60 the day before, and has stabilized around 100.When Redd-ID launches, people can tip w/ rdd via social media like instagram or twitter or youtube in addition to Likes and Shares.But more than that.... if you don&#039;t care about the taboo... this will be the coin used on adult cam sites.If you&#039;re looking for an overnight lambo, you&#039;re going to have to day trade between cryptos.If you&#039;re looking for a real alt-coin to invest in and see 10-1,000x returns in the coming months there is no better choice than RDD.Official client:https://www.reddcoin.com/#WalletsAnd here are steps to bootstrap so it won&#039;t take days to sync:https://wiki.reddcoin.com/index.php?title=Bootstrap_the_Reddcoin_BlockchainOriginal white paper from 2014:https://www.reddcoin.com/papers/PoSV.pdfWhitepaper FAQ:https://www.reddcoin.com/papers/PoSV_FAQ.pdfDiscussion board:https://www.reddcointalk.org/
Simple. ONLY buy ETH. When there is an urge of weak or strong hands just HODL and listen to this if its dropping or mooning. 5 year hold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ePQKD9iBfU

&gt;&gt;2282955crypto got me really excited about trading. a buddy of mine has been trading forex for about four years now, and he&#039;s gotten consistant. made $100k+ last year and works about 4 hours a week.So i&#039;ve been reading books on how to trade effectively, how to identify candlestick patterns, etc. so far crypto is crazy volatile, so most doesnt apply, but I&#039;m using this as my practice along with a thinkorswim papermoney account to practice. I hope that within six months not only will i have a better grasp of the concepts, but crypto money will help launch me into forex trading part time.
Get out pajeet
&gt;&gt;2282955I legitimately enjoy reporting your spam.
I work in management of a big retail company and make pretty good money and do crypto trading when I get off and I&#039;m bored.I made some minimal investments of ~200 -300 dollars just to play around back in september and those have turned into around 5 grand so far.Do any of you do this as a source of primary income? I&#039;ve got around 20k I could use to start more investments on top of the 5k I have in wallets and exchanges. If I just keep doing what I&#039;m doing could I quit my shitty job and live pretty comfy?Anyone else have experience doing this?
its a &#039;job&#039; like pro video gamer is a &#039;job&#039;feel free to refer to yourself as a &#039;crypto trader&#039; if you like being humiliated

Dont fall for itThese shills are all over leveraged in this massive PONZ. In slack, they talk about how they mortgaged their house, or withdrew from 401k, or have their entire life savings in this thing.There is blood in the streets, and their money is ripe for the taking! They have been throwing massive amounts of btc trying to keep this from going down, which means they are going to run out any minute now. Once the drop really happens its open season, and they will fold and sell and the house of cards will collapse, and you will all be able to buy back in at 100sats or lower. They have no choice, and they will get what they deserve for working with pump groups to push a PONZ
