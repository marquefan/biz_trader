This thread is for everyone investing in the Bancor ICO.I have a great portfolio, and I&#039;m breaking it all up to put 20 eth into this. I really want to put more in, but I refuse to sell some other coins I own. Let&#039;s talk about why we think Bancor is a great investment and how much we&#039;re putting in.Reminder: The best way to deal with FUD and /pol/ level trolling is to just ignore it and not give the attention they so desperately crave.
&gt;&gt;2407280&gt;/pol/ level trollingaka the truth
&gt;&gt;2407310They&#039;ll learn one day.
&gt;&gt;2407280&gt;&gt;2407310
&gt;&gt;2407280I&#039;m planning to put in 3.6 ETH I made on digibyte. I wrote it in another thread&gt;If any of you guys is using etoro, I&#039;ve just noticed that the charts for some alts have been added. One of bancor team members is Yoni Assia, CEO of etoro.BTC and ETH are on etoro since a while already, so I guess they might utilize bancor to trade other alts. People there are definitely going to get into cryptos, so this would generate trading volume for bancor.
&gt;&gt;2407310not really man. it turns out some jewish people are just normal people, and some mentally ill people aren&#039;t unappreciated geniuses.
I love Bancor because they promise so much for such a large investment.
&gt;&gt;2407356damn I didn&#039;t know about that, but that could generate some nice volume for BNT.
I&#039;ll throw some dust at it and hope it will explode into a lambo
I was gonna put in 15 now I might put in 20
&gt;&gt;2407459dust+2 years=lambo&gt;&gt;2407490do it bro. I don&#039;t want you only making $150k when we hit $100
&gt;&gt;2407280Planning to put in 10 ETH.They&#039;ve said that any excess over the cap will be put into a smart contract where you can exchange 1BNT for 0.01 ETH (the original ICO price). There is literally no way to lose money on this.
&gt;&gt;2407552how are more people not getting this. It can only make you money
In for 10 ETH.If they achieve what they set out to do it will change the crypto landscape and bring yuge returns.
&gt;&gt;2407552&gt;literally no way to lose money&gt;jews
&gt;&gt;2407552Yeah that&#039;s a big reason I decided to invest. I had some concerns about it being oversold, but them buying back at ICO price should solve that. Let&#039;s all get rich /biz/ bros
Fees, interests, a global bank.Have fun backstabbing the idea of bitcoin greedy faggots
&gt;&gt;2407517Thanks dude it&#039;s gonna be nearly half my eth but this really seems like a no-brainer. 2000 BNT here we come!
&gt;&gt;2407280putting 1k eth into this and hold 2 years
&gt;&gt;2407732god damn man you trying to become a billionaire?&gt;&gt;2407725Feels comfy in the 2k club.&gt;&gt;2407717So you don&#039;t have a bank account or a credit card? You don&#039;t use fiat currency ever? hypocrite.
&gt;&gt;2407768Fuck this seems like it could securely grow to be huge. Let&#039;s say it starts at a 3 or 400m market cap, then catches up to where eth is now in a year, that&#039;s nearly 100*!!!
&gt;&gt;2407797yeah and then you and I are sitting on $700k my friend. certainly a long way from here, but I could see it happening.
&gt;&gt;2407671&gt;&gt;2407879&gt;/biz/ bros&gt;my friend&gt;hypocriteshilling at its finest
&gt;&gt;240787920 mins!
&gt;&gt;2407360They still are inflating the whole worlds economy though.
&gt;&gt;2408006They don&#039;t need me to shill for them, bud. They&#039;re doing just fine on their own drumming up demand.
&gt;&gt;2408047It&#039;s just a coordinated fud campaign to keep price low by driving people away from ICO
&gt;&gt;2408070You have mental problems if you actually believe that.
The blatant shilling. Jesus. At least adjust the way you speak before you plop your little jew seedlings on here.
&gt;&gt;2407280Jews get out!Sage
&gt;&gt;2408089Nah m8 you do.
nobody worried that it might drop when hitting exchanges like waves did because it was overhyped?
&gt;&gt;2407280can the ETH be sent from bittrex?
&gt;bittrex ETH withdrawals from 20 minutes ago still unconfirmed&gt;trying to withdraw 10 ETH to put in Bancori&#039;m not going to make it am i
&gt;&gt;2408070damn man I withdrew 10 eth from bittrex 18 mins ago and that tx is still pending. looks like I might only be in the 1k club. is the eth blockchain being fucked up already because of this ICO?
&gt;&gt;2408183yep, withdrew a couple ETH 30 mins ago with no problems, now trying to withdraw more and the whole network is congestedgonna have to settle for &lt;300 BNT :(
https://blog.bancor.network/gas-price-has-a-cap-bedab081b3d0&gt;Our smart contracts require a minimum of 200,000 gas. Meaning you need to set the limit to be 200,000 or above but definitely not less than that.If you decide to set the limit to 500,000, this only means you will be willing to pay more for the transaction but this will not get you any advantages or priorities with the miners.So no need to have anything more than 200000 gas at 50 Gwei?
is it active now? the countdown is still going down but it says its starts at 1400 GMT which it already is???? wtf
&gt;&gt;2408183I pulled 5 eth out of gdax just now
why is the fee 0.12 in the wallet and how do you change gas price?
&gt;&gt;2408070If you want to see coordinated FUD, look to DGB or XRP. Get out of here with your &quot;Bancor is being FUDDED&quot; nonsense.
&gt;&gt;2407280Shit... just found out my mobile wallet will not do tokens. fuck. I wanted to BNT today. fuuuuck.
&gt;&gt;2408209god damnit man. hopefully it goes through in time for me to contribute.&gt;&gt;2408214yeah, as far as I can tell there&#039;s no need to go higher than 200000 and 50.
&gt;&gt;2408232nah dude you are thinking of GMT + 1
&gt;&gt;2408266so it hasnt started yet? ah shit daylight savings time
is 25 gwei enough or should I do 50 ? what is the difference?
all these unconfirmed bittrex withdrawalshttps://etherscan.io/address/0xfbb1b73c4f0bda4f67dca266ce6ef42f520fbb98
&gt;&gt;2408300Just do 50, it&#039;s what, 2 dollars difference?
&gt;&gt;2408300do 50 like they reccomend just to be sure
&gt;&gt;2408174No, Bittrex will get your tokens.
&gt;&gt;2408314&gt;&gt;2408318thank you both
&gt;&gt;2407280Do I just use myetherwallet?

How do I know if I sent it on Myetherwallet?I even clicked 2 times on generate transaction FUCK
serious question. Ethereum wallet from free wallet .org people says no tokens. what happens if I sent anyways?
&gt;&gt;2407360&gt;&gt;2407280bancor shills are literally kikes. really makes you think.
how long does it take to withdraw eth from bittrex. also, do you have to do anything to receive the eth or is it exactly the same as with bitcoin it just arrives?
Sage all bancor threads
&gt;&gt;2408410same here...
&gt;&gt;2408383

&gt;Transaction Information (Pending)
&gt;&gt;2408391I changed the node on the right top corner to etherscan.io.Now it works.
&gt;Didn&#039;t make it into Bitcoin Suisse presale&gt;Gave them my ETH to put in for me anyway cos I knew it would be a clusterfuck and I trust them more than myself to actually get it thereHere&#039;s hoping they pull through boys
&gt;&gt;2408383&gt;&gt;2408391just change node to etherscan. worked for me.
IT IS A SCAM
Myetherwallet fix:upper right corner, change your node to etherscan.

&gt;&gt;2408447IT DOES NOTHING
&gt;PENDING...
&gt;&gt;2408466life-saviour &lt;3
&gt;&gt;2408510Choose ETH (Etherscan.io).That worked for me.

&gt;&gt;2408502Thanks!!

DON&#039;T FALL FOR THE JEWISH SCAM
I sent it from coinomi, and didnt have an option to change the &quot;gas&quot;... will it be alright? :/
STOP BUYING THIS SNEAKY JEW TOKEN
P E N D I N G
&gt;&gt;2408544did you get through?&gt;&gt;2408546create a myetherwallet real quick, withdraw from bittrex to that, and hope you can get in.
&gt;&gt;2408546idiot your trying to figure this out NOW?you are literally not getting in this club.
&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447&gt;&gt;2408447
&gt;&gt;2407280Sage all bancor threads
&gt;&gt;2408546Jesus christ. You had WEEKS to plan for this. Make a myetherwallet account, send eth there. Then set gas to 200000, set gas price to 50 Gwei (Bottom of the page, slider to max). Then send.
PENDINGGwhat happens if its still pending over the minium time ?
&gt;&gt;2408575Yes, even after only two confirmations the tokens were sent to my address.
&gt;&gt;2408447G-D BLESS YOUHoly fuck thank you.Now my transaction is pending.You guys think we will get in before the hour is up???
&gt;&gt;2408589then we don&#039;t get in. or if enough txs are pending they might not have hit their cap and then some of us will get in.
&gt;Unable to locate Transaction entryWHAT THE FUCKK LADS
Who here /pending/?
Can I get a quick rundown on why bancor is revolutionary?
&gt;&gt;2408588What happens if i didnt set it to 50 gwei....? i thought it sent if i jsut put it to 200000 gas? what the fuck didn&#039;t realize i needed to set that fucking slider too
&gt;&gt;2408614yea i got this every time i tried
&gt;&gt;2408607I got in quite quickly, about 3 minutes.Anybody know how to view BANCOR tokens in myEtherWallet?
I think I already received the Bancor Tokens but it doesnt show up in myetherwallet... do i need to add a custom token to see it?
What address do you guys see here?Is it this one?https://bancor.network/fundraiser
&gt;&gt;2407310pol is always right, this will kill a lot of shitcoins and I&#039;ll be glad.
&gt;&gt;2408509well, I assume they could check which transactions were initiated before the 1-hour time limit ran out, then give all the eligible addresses their BNT tokens?
&gt;&gt;2408626ur probably fucked
What happens if it&#039;s pending after the time limit? Do you get fucked?
&gt;&gt;2408546you can&#039;t - send it to a wallet first dingus
&gt;&gt;2408626Then your transaction will take longer, might not go through? There might still be a chance though. Good luck.&gt;&gt;2408641Yes.
&gt;&gt;2408641no it&#039;s this one0x5cd207451D49Bb739Dabd563d8419DD1251daa85
13 mins ago Still pending
&gt;&gt;2408588Oh my god I&#039;m retarded, I kept looking for it, didn&#039;t think it would be way out there, I thought myetherwallet just handled it differently with the gas limit.Is my TX even going to go through? lol
&gt;&gt;2408626i&#039;m in the same boat, didn&#039;t see the fucking slider damn
&gt;&gt;2408607&gt;You guys think we will get in before the hour is up???I think we&#039;re fucked. Look how many are pending (4,755).https://etherscan.io/address/0xBbc79794599b19274850492394004087cBf89710
&gt;&gt;2408659Maybe? If you didn&#039;t send all of your ETH, if you really trust the project, then send more? Up to you really.
Once /biz/ gets scammed by the Jews, /pol/ will rightfully annex you. Prepare for Hitlercoin.
MUH BANCORMUH LAMBO LANDMUH MISSING ETH&gt;THE CITY OF (YOU)&gt;MFW NO COINERS HAVE THE LAST LAUGHBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
&gt;&gt;2407280&gt;https://twitter.com/Bancor_Network/status/874265665431105537QUICK GUYS I&#039;VE JUST DROPPED 100 ETH . HERE QUICK DEPOSIT ADDRESS:0xe3A19BfeD3b9417Df5a8F66aefcac4cF931Af94F
bancor ico broke the network..i think this is gonna be bigwish i had more than a few ether to buy with..I had bitcoin ready to purchase eth a year ago but got scared off by the dao fisasco..If I hadn&#039;t bought an ounce of weed with bitcoin back in 2012 and saved it like i was telling my friends to buy for investment i&#039;d be freaking rich right now.i was sitting on 500 bitcoin at one point.. that i bought for $2 a pop just after it crashed from 30.. wish i knew then what i know now
&gt;&gt;2408667Should have used DGB instead of ETH
&gt;&gt;2408682fake fuck off
the nodes are crashing
&gt;&gt;2408680your girlfriend sure is fat bro
&gt;&gt;2408682omg t-thx annon, I just sent 5,000,000 ETH.
&gt;&gt;2408682kys
&gt;&gt;2408508yeah why not what the fuck do i do now how long does a transaction take will i be able to use another wallet?
&gt;&gt;2407280None. I&#039;ve been fucked by ShapeShift, and it&#039;ll probably be over by the time it clears.
PENDING SINCE 10 MINUTES AGO!!!!!!!!!!Did MyEtherWallet just cuck me out of a lambo lads?
&gt;&gt;2408682Sent ;)
&gt;&gt;2408720i got in in 3 minutes, but it was at the very beginning of the ICO. You can use myetherwallet - see my last post for details.&gt;&gt;2408588
&gt;&gt;2408636yes, if you click on your tx it will show you the address it was sent to and just add the contract id to your watchlist I was scared at first too
Pending for 18 mins hereRRREEEEE
&gt;&gt;2408730I&#039;ve been waiting 3 and a half hours. JUST fuck my lambo up
how do I set gas limit? I found gas price at the bottom of the page of myetherwallet but I can&#039;t find gas limit to set it to 200000.
Already 68k ETH given...
&gt;itt no one learned their lesson from BAT
&gt;&gt;2408758it&#039;s directly under the amount of eth you want to send...
This is suppose to be the future of currency...Everyone getting cucked and fucked waiting...
&gt;&gt;2408768what was the lesson - I missed that ICO - invest or not to invest?
&gt;&gt;2408779sounds like business as usual. fucking jews.
&gt;&gt;2408667Already up to 2104 transactions now...If that&#039;s the processing speed, and the &#039;pending&#039; amount was accurate, I think we should be able to get in before the hour is over.Christ, what the fuck is this thing going to be valued at?Would be comfy af if /biz/ gets in and everyone else is left out because some robot decided to break the network with 1m 0.001 eth transfers.
crashing the explorer
How do I see my Bancor balance in my Ethereum wallet?
pending
well mines still pending and transaction record cant be found, might just shut off my computer and come back in a couple hours to see if i have this memecoin in my wallet
&gt;&gt;2408786BAT was a retarded premise. The lesson was to read the whitepaper before investing.
&gt;&gt;2408765btw I made this 5 mn ago if you want to check, just add an id=&quot;test&quot; to the table of transactions on etherscan and run it with your browservar table = document.getElementById(&quot;test&quot;);var total = 0;for (var i = 0, row; row = table.rows[i]; i++) {if (i != 0) {for (var j = 0, col; col = row.cells[j]; j++) {if (j==6) {col = parseFloat(col.innerText.substring(0, col.innerText.length - 6));total += parseFloat(col);console.log(total);}}}}
&gt;&gt;2408786it sold out in 24 secondsand 5 people got over 50 percent of the total volumesmall time investors (i.e. /biz/ ) all got fucked and couldn&#039;t buy shit
&gt;&gt;2408786
&gt;Unable to locate Transaction entryWhat does this mean? Has my ether been send or not?
&gt;&gt;2408801WITH NO SHURVIVORS
&gt;&gt;2408800Well my transaction failed.Says &#039;Unable to locate Transaction entry&#039;Oh well.
&gt;&gt;2408827most of the nodes broken aswelalso FUCKING 23 MINS PENDING
&gt;&gt;2408835Same here, tried 3 times
&gt;&gt;2408823lol 5 times ICO price is what you left out of that pic.
Can anyone tell me what&#039;s so great about Bancor and why one should send their funds to it?
&gt;tfw you gambled your whole life savings on this icouuuhhh guys?
Will our ETH be refunded if it doesnt go through?
since you guys seem to be too retarded to read the details, I made a nice simple guide from myetherwallet.Feel free to send me some eth: 0xaB0E0f2f4300a9408765797061D4Eb45E0425073
&gt;&gt;2408835Ok now it&#039;s back.
Trying to use imToken but I keep getting this error after about 15 minutes
So where is the BNT under &quot;Token Balances&quot;Did we all get kiked
the transaction isn&#039;t even completingclick send transaction in myetherwallet and nothing happens, funds don&#039;t go out but I still get charged for gas
&gt;&gt;2408881it would be real funny if it didn&#039;t....wouldn&#039;t it...jewishman.jpg
DO SOMETHING
why am I getting &quot;The contract won&#039;t allow this transaction to be executed&quot;
&gt;Unable to locate Transaction entry
&gt;bittrex widthdrawal transaction made 45 minutes ago is no longer even on the blockchaingonna be days before i get those coins
&gt;&gt;2408878they basically promised to be the newest way to create coins WITHIN coins using ethereum as their base. basically any business could make a coin using the bancor protocoland it was all started by a jewish startup from israelput two and two together friend. this is was a scam from day one. put funds into it if you want to fund zionism
&gt;&gt;2408920You broke the gas limit? It&#039;s 200000
&gt; goys come up with divine technology to break away from jewish debt slavery&gt; everyone is getting rich&gt; jews come up with diabolic scheme to regain control of cryptocurencies&gt; goys fund their own downfall through ICOnice job you idiots
&gt;&gt;2408933

I&#039;ve got 4 BTC but I gotta diversifywhere should I go? will give tip for well argued points
ICNXZC
ETH.Or if you were thinking about Bancor but afraid of not getting in on the ICO, get into WINGS
ETCXBY
&gt;&gt;2405423LTC XRP and ETC
By long term I would choose RDD, its very cheap and it has good expectations. also UBQ is growing and has good return1FtUzhiBtXKtst24G9Uqktba62n5dArTv9
&gt;&gt;2405423You might want to look at Decred(DCR)Its a very complex, unique currency with very intelligent devs. Its both PoS and PoW. Strong fundamentals and huge upwards potential.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzIoHfDgUW8This is a video you might wanna check out.Also most of the twitter traders are bullish on DCR, most claiming it will reach a 100$ till the end of the year if not sooner. (its at 43$ now.)Pic related, chart and order books look very healthy.Do some of your own research and Im sure youll find that this is a very good mid to long term hold.Tip will be appreciated:BTC: 1Ngz8JRMoJ8j7oXnMhMayf9LBNhFyYLF71
&gt;&gt;2405485I made a killing on DGB and DCR is my first investment since I liquidatedAlso there&#039;s the order book.
&gt;&gt;2405423Swarm City begins implementing their marketplace on June 15th. Currently their SWT tokens are hovering around $5.60/SWT on Bittrex. For a short play, I would go with them. (It might end up a good long move as well, but it&#039;s riskier. The concept is genius but normie adoption rates could be too low.)Here&#039;s the Dev explaining it in detail:https://youtu.be/UzORm-M8BWk1FEtYRxBJu3uzw3wtSoLpQfkfcivyxUGCa

&gt;&gt;2405521looks like a scamhttps://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2017/06/stratis-coin-redflags-abound-in-short.html
&gt;&gt;2405485Also, they have a on-chain voting system which is explained in the video. It is unique for decred
&gt;&gt;2405622I came in here to give my 2 cents and ended up learning something awesome from your posts. Thanks anon! I wish I had BTC to tip you, but I just went heavy into SWT, at least shorterm. I never had a huge amount of BTC, jumped in late, swore never to do that again. Hence the SWT, and now maybe this crypto.This board has been brutal lately, so your well thought out post is appreciated!
&gt;&gt;2405686Im glad I was able to help anon, your post is enough gratification for me. Good luck and happy trading.
&gt;&gt;2405730Thanks bud! You too!
&gt;&gt;2405423OP, I am going to nominate this anon&gt;&gt;2405485for your tip, if you&#039;re only doing one. I just did a ton of reading on his post and mid/long term his suggestion is excellent.
&gt;&gt;2405574Looks like that guy made that blog because he was upset he bought high and sold low.

&gt;&gt;2405936That seems to be the smart move right now. I&#039;ve actually been somewhat won over by their entire concept and it puts me in a dangerous position where I&#039;m thinking less logically than I should be.
&gt;&gt;24054233DrEhuCcgA6VnojDDskpGXdL3YQevC61vLif you follow any e-celebs, you&#039;ll find they are constantly complaining about Youtube fucking them over. Steemit is essentially youtube with tokens, I imagine all it will take is one e-celeb getting a video demonetized and bringing several million people to the platform to make the price jump.This is still a ways off, but it seems like a highly likely occurrence. Happy trading!
&gt;&gt;2405423Hi, AnonI&#039;ve been in your place before and was reading everything I could myself for a couple of months.I&#039;ll give you some tips I&#039;ve posted on my living room wall.Part 1Principles:&gt;1. Never lose money.If you lose 50%, you have to get 100% back to be where you started&gt;2. Asymetric risk/reward. Diversifiaction is a free lunch. Because it reduces risk and increases the reward. Have no more than 10% in high risk coins. Increasing investments from 2 coins to atleast 15 (25 is ideal) increases your risk-reward ratio by about 30.&gt;3. It&#039;s what you keep after costs/taxes.Figure out a way to trade less. This eats a way about 0.5% of your money for a round trip trade. If you think in terms of comound interest this is huge sums. (Tens of thousands across years). Have your storage harder to trace back to you - exchanges, wallets so if you cahs out to a bank you can tax a single sum. (Ofcourse there are other ways to avoid taxes).-Cont-
&gt;&gt;2405423-Cont-Part 2&gt;4. Diversify across:A. Exchanges. They are still companies based in a specific place with incentives. They can always be hacked. Kraken is safe for Europeans, Polo is the biggest, Bittrex for example have wide variety of risky coins.B. Coins. For long-term safe investing - 10% high risk coins [Bottom top 60-100 of market cap top], 50% in top 3 of the market cap, the rest in Top 20.For active investing, If you have a favourite coin - look at their dev team, corporate support (ETH is great for this), fanbase (bitcoin), and how active they are on media, likely hood of new money flowing in (what they offer consumers)C. Countries who hold coins - some countries accumulate specific coins - can create risk if one country (China bank rulings on BTC for example) or safety if equal.D. Sources of information. Everyone shills. Everyone predicts moons and crashes. Noone knows. Truly. You can check any data - there arent any acurate wizards. Only true fact is price. But know the market sentiment and know if greed or fear stimulates people.&gt;5. Patience.Correction happen atleast 1x a week for most coins, crashes 1x a month. That means your favourite coin will go down 50% atleast once in any given month. Be patient. Also, Crashes are your best friend. The point of maximum pessimism.For my own high-risk shill advice I would go Nexus for the global use of free internet they plan, and for safe the BTC/ETH Split of 1-3 and mid-risky for LTC now that its back on the map. But consider the principles as paramount to any current market trends. It all changes very fast.Use this adress if want to thank your friendly /biz/vestor:18z99sAKZAxjXcCY8951pQ9ryGcVUTQtpmGood luck OP!

&gt;&gt;2406886&gt;poor man&#039;s ETH/STRAT
I would put 1 btc right now into Waves. A Russian Billionaire is now on board. His name is Titov.1 btc into ARK right now. It&#039;s down 18%, It&#039;ll come back in next few days..5 into OK Coin. One of the biggest communities in Crypto. it will be worth 10$ a coin one day. OK coind will freak yu out with random up 100% days..5 RLC because of all the super computer coins, this is the one that will deliver..5 into GBYTE because this thing does nothing but grow and grow.Keep .5 in BTC to buy when something drops
decred and blocknet. Do your research and you&#039;ll see that they have ETH like potential. Thank me later1B3zYuz4y3ErLDjuXC8PaZmWcP1af3WDUn
&gt;&gt;2409101I also want to add that they&#039;re both dirt cheap right now because so many people funneled money into BTC.
Wow, in a matter of a month this board has become a cesspool of /b/tards and /pol/zis.NGR coin? Really?1. You guys are never getting your money back.2. You&#039;ve giving the crypto community a horrible name right now.I know this thread will be overrun by our new friendly shills, but I&#039;m pretty done with /biz/ at least until the next crash comes. I hope all you cancerous newfags lose every dollar you have.

&gt;people are saying things i dont like!&gt;stop doing things i dont like!No, we are free to do what we want. Cry more.&gt;OP: I invest in cryptocurrency (a decentralized currency) but get mad when people use this decentralized currency and went to stop them from using it in a way I don&#039;t like.You are mother fucker?
&gt;&gt;2397327This shit is so stupid. Your personal life must be fucking miserable.
&gt;&gt;2397288I tried to get into crypto last year and failed miserably in the &quot;convert dollars to cryptocurrency&quot; part, but this is genius. As soon as the media reports on it it&#039;s gonna skyrocket.Also&gt;literally owning niggersit&#039;s like pottery
&gt;&gt;2397331&gt;t. alphonse
&gt;&gt;2397288I hate niggers as much as the next guy but I agree with OP. Doing this stupid shit childish shit will only make more normies be okay with government cracking down on crypto.How fucking immature are you faggots?
&gt;&gt;2397288shut up nigger
&gt;&gt;2397340fuck off to leddit, cuck13iKHDaDiywag9f33YyDfkdXeUQbWEBccA
&gt;&gt;2397378its fucking decentralized, they cant do shit&gt;supporting a decentralized currency, but then wanting to police it for &quot;hate speech&quot;you cant, youve missed the point of cryptocurrency completely, we can do what we want, cry more
&gt;&gt;2397288WE WUZ CRYPTO TRADERS AND SHEITkys nigger
&gt;&gt;2397378The racist in chief will not mind
&gt;&gt;2397288&gt;&gt;2397340&gt;enslaved nigger
Okay, this has gotten to the point where it&#039;s not even funny anymore. You&#039;re just shilling your shitty coin without any real good memes all over this board. It&#039;s totally fucking annoying...
&gt;&gt;2397378&gt;ThisIf the news ever reports this (which they probably won&#039;t you bubbled dumbfucks) they are going to press the darker (stupider) side of crypto until normies never want it.The typical normie knows about buying drugs with bitcoin, they know about pedophilia on the deep web (well, actually just /b/ nowadays), and now they&#039;d know that the crypto community is an uninviting cesspool of backwards child-of-a-conservative fucks.You guys are actually trying to make it harder for legit coins to get traction, ultimately making us all poorer.Maybe if you weren&#039;t fucking autist level edgelords you&#039;d realize that.
&gt;&gt;2397438cry more, we can do what we wantits decentralized and you cant stop us.&gt;cryptocurrencies should be controlled to avoid &quot;hate speech&quot;nope, fuck you nigger
&gt;Thanks /pol/!
&gt;&gt;2397446cry more, we will do what we want&gt;your coin cant have HATE SPEECH!Fuck you and fuck off, if you want censorship go somewhere else.
&gt;&gt;2397468Okay guy, singlehandedly shitpost more. Your team of &lt;25 y/o autists is going to keep this shit up, why pay any attention to me?
&gt;&gt;2397288Still better than DGB shill threads.
&gt;&gt;2397490Stay btfo
&gt;&gt;2397490&gt; shouldnt be allowed to say things i dont like, or trade currencies i dont likeyou sure cryptocurrency is the right field for you? maybe you should try a different boardlmfao
&gt;&gt;2397557That&#039;s not what I&#039;m saying.Lmao&gt;YOU CAN&#039;T TELL US WHAT TO DO WE&#039;RE GROWN UPS NOW MOM I SAY NIGGER WITH MY FRIENDS ONLINE. I DON&quot;T NEED A GF PLEASE LET ME LIVE WITH YOU UNTIL I&#039;m 30
&gt;&gt;2397288OP is so right. This puts a black eye on biz and creates unnecessary risk in the cryptosphere just so a bunch of anonymous neckbeards can have some &#039;edge.&#039;.Anons, are you all so rich you&#039;re ready to throw your money away at some dumb, racist project? At least look out for yourselves...why would you even consider NGR coin when you can make enough money to quit your job and retire if you just take this seriously? Ark, Lisk, Waves, Bitshares, ether, dash, pivx and two dozen more....all red hot right now. Do those.Look, I made over 350k last month and paid cash for an M4 last week. I&#039;m early 30&#039;s and quit my day job as a lawyer. I&#039;m fucking Rainman at assessing risk and evaluating the scene, so do what you want, but you&#039;d all do a lot better to take some friendly advice from a bro that knows what&#039;s up.
&gt;&gt;2397583&gt;stop saying things I dont like!&gt;stop trading currencies I dont like!You dont understand cryptocurrencies. We can do what we want, cry more.All this does is keep pussies (like you) away from crypto while we accumulate. Crypto adoption is inevitable.

&gt;&gt;2397820&gt;they&#039;re being given out for freeI thought you needed wave tokens to get them
&gt;&gt;2397288not about making money, niggerjew
&gt;&gt;2397834are you the mexican who used to shitpost in /o/?
&gt;&gt;2397405&gt;Tump&gt;racistYou&#039;re an idiot, he&#039;s a complete cuck that loves niggers
&gt;&gt;2397784Not everyone else in the world is a brainwashed retarded PC american
&gt;&gt;2397806I never thought said blockchain would be abandoned. I&#039;m worried about the backlash from normies and governments cracking down. Governments could make our lives a living hell by imposing taxes or fees. Or maybe something even worse.My point is, crypto doesn&#039;t need another blackeye. This nigger coin shit is so fucking childish.
/biz/ should be pass users onlyinstantly would remove all the 15 year old pajeets spamming shitcoins hoping to make 25 cents
&gt;&gt;2397834I honestly don&#039;t have an argument and don&#039;t wish to argue, merely point and laugh. I just realize that you must clearly hate money due to your warped mindset.This is what hapoens when containment boards don&#039;t do thier job.
&gt;&gt;2397870Being an egdelord makes you just as bad.
&gt;&gt;2397903You do a great disservice to white men by assuming they&#039;re not capable of shilling
&gt;&gt;2397288Don&#039;t worry, they all &quot;invested&quot; in xby. They&#039;ll lose it all soon enough.
&gt;&gt;2397331I am not OP.However I am a mother fucker.I have fucked several mothers, the first being the local tv weather girl. It sucked; she didnt.The most recent mother I have fucked is my wife who Hs two children with me.speaking of children - you are acting like children and I suspect several of you are still minors.But hey - go right ahead and practice saying these things in utter anonymity so that you will be well-rehearsed when you go to your job and say some stupid edgy shit (because in my experience every racist shows it sometime) and get fired.Then you will more time on here to complain about how its everyone else&#039;s fault but yours.
&gt;&gt;2397288This is what happens when /biz/fags shill on /pol/. We got what we deserved.
&gt;&gt;2397468its not really censorship.
&gt;&gt;2397998&gt;get fired.normie. true /biz/nesmen have their own companies.
&gt;&gt;2397903This would be fantastic. If not this, then maybe a seperate /biz/ for pass holders would work too. For starters, the nature of the discussion on /biz/ makes us FAR more susceptible to spammers than other boards, because this is the only board where there is an actual direct financial incentive to spam. Additionally, if you can&#039;t afford $20 why does anybody need to be listening to your opinion on business anyway?
&gt;&gt;2397998&gt;till you say something racist and get firedkek, my boss makes nigger jokes all the time
&gt;&gt;2397616&gt;We can do what we want, cry more.Those should be two sentences, or perhaps, set off with a semi-colon instead of a comma.i guess it depends on your intent. As it is, it reads like you are saying that you want to do what you want, which to cry more.
Who the fuck invited /pol/ to our board?It was so comfy before then
&gt;&gt;2397732holy fuck anon, why are you such a cringy edgelord
&gt;&gt;2398098there are 0 threads on /pol/ about this.
&gt;&gt;2398042This is more of a /b/ / /pol/ mix, /pol/ is essentially anti-pc and counterculture and hating on lower class black Americans is definitely part of that. But this overdoing of it is meant to trigger responses in others, like a troll, it&#039;s not really /pol/.
&gt;&gt;2398098NGR shilling isnt /pol/ though
&gt;&gt;2397732Actually - crypto purchases is better described at speculating, not investing.I suppose there are some crypto that the proceeds from the sales go toward developing apps and such, in which case you are using the currency itself to invest in the underlying tech, but somehow that has not come across in many of the boards.edge on

&gt;&gt;2398112&gt;&gt;&gt;/pol/129518921Dude nigger XD
&gt;&gt;2398098Prepare to be lectured about how &quot;/pol/ founded /biz/ we were pretty much always here&quot; when the board has never looked remotely like this in its history.
&gt;&gt;2397998&gt;&gt;2397288Kill yourselves shitlibs. Leftist subhuman scum is not welcome here.
&gt;/biz/ shilled crypto all the time to /pol/ months back&gt;/pol/ comes to /biz/&gt;some of us stay&gt;/biz/ bitches about us being here nowYou brought this on yourselves, what did you think was going to happen as a smaller board shilling on a larger one? Only an idiot would expect no change in board culture after inviting immigrants.
&gt;&gt;2398137Fucking seriously ?30 posts on /pol/ pointing out the nigger spam proves that /pol/ coordinated it?Fuck off. The nigger spam will die in a week anyway.
&gt;&gt;2398180kek
&gt;&gt;2398180&gt;Only an idiot would expect no change in board culture after inviting immigrants.&gt;Literally the same guy who would shitpost&gt;&quot;THE WALL JUST GOT 10ft HIGHER&quot;&gt;So ironic it&#039;s painful.
&gt;&gt;2397288Yeah they are going to give us a bad name.... I would pay for crypto only board with pass only access
&gt;&gt;2398124True. NGR is a trollcoin and related discussions are for entertainment.Nevertheless, I do specifically remember Ethereum shill threads on /pol/.
&gt;&gt;2398209What&#039;s ironic about it you retarded nigger? It&#039;s evidence that if you like your culture the way it is, you should in fact build a wall. Dumbass.
&gt;&gt;2398180Literally the Muslim rapefugee attitude&gt;You tried to help us by making us richer and happier so now we get to invade and fuck up your culture so that no one gets to prosper
communist here, made some profits on this shitcoin that i&#039;m going to invest in a gulag for all of you
&gt;&gt;2398243exactly, /pol/s point is proven, assimilation does not work and immigration is deaththanks for playingbuy niggercoin
&gt;&gt;2397288Pretty edgy and insecure stuff over here, but what did you expect to find on 4chan, the default place for all insecure and wanna be edgy kids?If you don&#039;t like the shill and spam, the intelligent thing is to just move on and find another place to post that&#039;s at least decent to invest your time.It&#039;s going to stop eventually for a newer (Probably &#039;edgier&#039;) thing, though.
&gt;&gt;2398237&gt;Be the immigrant&gt;&quot;FUCK IMMIGRANTS&quot;

&gt;&gt;2397438Fuck off. I&#039;m still laughing.
&gt;&gt;2398070based boss
&gt;&gt;2398272Great so it&#039;s /pol/... fucking autist
&gt;&gt;2397998&gt;But hey - go right ahead and practice saying these things in utter anonymity so that you will be well-rehearsed when you go to your job and say some stupid edgy shit (because in my experience every racist shows it sometime) and get fired.that&#039;s not how it works dummy4chan is literally my blow off valve where I can vent my views without worrying so that I can continue hiding my power level irl
&gt;&gt;2397452no one&#039;s talking about hate speech you dumb shit. Stop arguing with strawmen.We want you to stop spamming and shitting up /biz/
&gt;&gt;2398346&gt;implying /pol/ isn&#039;t just an attempt to tame what used to be /b/ and /news//pol/ is 4chan, 4chan is /pol/deal with it
Fuck off /pol/tards, you&#039;re the reason why 4chan is shittier than ever.

&gt;&gt;2399023Listen you leddit shithead. I remember /n/ and the Ron Paul spam. You may have been one of those retards who only browsed /b/, so that may explain why you&#039;re wrong.
&gt;&gt;2399038You must be the coolest kid in school
&gt;&gt;2399043I&#039;m being dead ass serious. /b/ was all for Obama. You might just be a newfag and jumped in his second term but his first term /b/ was all for him
&gt;&gt;2399023You sure told me plebbit/b/ only supported obongo in the primaries because they thought it would be easier to beat a nigger
&gt;&gt;2399066NGR will bring coons to the moon!
&gt;&gt;2399092Nope you&#039;re WROOOOOOOONG don&#039;t get mad because b supported a person with darker skin. It&#039;s ok poltard
&gt;&gt;2398255
&gt;&gt;2399084&gt;&gt;2399043&gt;&gt;2398947&gt;&gt;2398903&gt;&gt;2398738I distinctly remember both. There were Paultards and there were Obama supporters (back in 08, not so much in 12).
Secret code word for nigger coins is now mooncrickets. Don&#039;t let the normalfags know.
&gt;&gt;2399092&gt;/b/ only supported obongo in the primaries because they thought it would be easier to beat a niggerYeah, not at all. Literally, no one on 4chan supported McCain/Palin, that is just a straight up fact.
Whatever happened with Trumpcoin? I woulda thought it shoulda gone to the moon when he won.
&gt;&gt;2397288Kek stay poor whiteboi
&gt;&gt;2399197He&#039;s a newfag he&#039;s to young to know about this
&gt;&gt;2399230Celebrity coins are a meme, avoid at all costs. The only way I could see one working is if it were like a Taylor Swift coin or some shit that you could sell for tickets, backstage passes etc. Another possibility could be something like Yankeescash or Lakerscoin that you get in on early and possibly be able to trade in for amazing seats and unique fan experiences if it moons.
&gt;&gt;2397288BTC has been /pol/ - tier since it&#039;s inception.It&#039;s only that you&#039;re late finding out about it.
&gt;&gt;2399289Thats a good idea, taylor could pull this off if she wanted.
Haaa Taylor Swift, yea right. If ya got half a brain and want good things you follow trump and his Trumpcoin
&gt;&gt;2399307Btc was a /g/ thing. Newfag spotted
&gt;&gt;2399197&gt;implying /b/tards weren&#039;t fapping to the idea of having her as a VPlmao&gt;&gt;2399172of course there were Obongotards, just like there were Hilldawgs in /pol/ recently. That doesn&#039;t mean &quot;/b/ supported obongo&quot;, the majority were in for based Ron
&gt;&gt;2399427The very idea of a currency with limited supply is /pol/ tier
&gt;&gt;2399289Why haven&#039;t we created a mooncoin yet?
&gt;&gt;2397454
&gt;&gt;2399624This is how I know you are newfag part 3. Moon coin was created and shilled last month. Get out of /biz/ you new fagit got back to /pol/
&gt;&gt;2400710&gt;taking a break makes one a newfagreally made me think
&gt;&gt;2400865&gt;taking a breakMooncoin is three years old.
This edgy 16 year old racism meme is 20x worse than SJWism. There I said it.
Go back to fucking /reddit/, nigger.Yeah, I hope the Crypto market doesn&#039;t grow soon or else it&#039;s going to stagnate like stocks market.I hope you nigger die. Fucking faggot, you are disgusting
&gt;&gt;2400865&gt;takingna breakLol lame excuse try again new fag
&gt;&gt;2397454The niggerboom is ruining /biz/ with hundreds of threads, but how are you calling anyone /pol/? All of 4chan hates niggers and kikes and calls them out all the time and /biz/ is one of the boards that does it the most, whether you like it or not, nigger.
&gt;&gt;2397454mfw I now see why people want regulation on free speechseriously though these spams on the board is making people hate the shill and pump and dump postsI put some in once in a while but holy shit.
&gt;&gt;2400931yea you can tell by posts like this&gt;&gt;2400933it&#039;s adhd 15 year olds who are behind most of it

&gt;&gt;2400966Then go back to tumblr or reddit, retard.You don&#039;t like it here, leave. This place is not for you.Are you such a faggot that not even tumblr and reddit likes you so you have to come here and bitch about its userbase?Fuck off

&gt;&gt;2400931Hi nigger. Enjoy your stay.
&gt;&gt;2401057&gt;t. edgelord on tilt when his money is on the line in a racist shitcoin that will never work.Oh boy, this will be fun to watch from the sidelines.
&gt;&gt;2399427&gt;Newfag spottedlel.I&#039;ve monitored BTC threads on /b/ / /g/ since 2009 but only got into it 2013. Picture related is from March 2013.
&gt;&gt;2401057
&gt;&gt;2397288I agree
this NGR coin is from a bunch of fags in another social outlet jealous of the gains made here so they are trying to ruin it here. Well done OP at letting them win with you.Such a shitcoin they are giving it away over and over to clog up this thread. Only tards will invest in this crap, and sadly about 30% of this channel are tards.
&gt;&gt;2397288They are probably doing the nigger coin thing ato puncish us for the whole DGB thing
&gt;&gt;2401160&gt;&gt;2401192Back to /r/eddit, retards.Who ever said that they plan on getting rich by selling niggers? People made it as a joke, in case you are such a newfag that you didn&#039;t see the first threads last week saying as if it was an already stable coin on yobit and bittrex.Say all the shit you want, go to the first page or the catalog and you will see that I have /biz/ as a whole while you two circlejerk in this shit tier thread. The only thing that made it get out of control is that many of us have lots of cheap niggers that we are trading as a joke(not for profit) and are giving it out. And everyone likes free shit. I&#039;ve given and received free niggers.
&gt;&gt;2401203Shit, I thought it was the /biz/ old-timers trying to run off the coin kiddies. Go figure.
&gt;&gt;2401275Well good luck with your racist play tokens anon, I&#039;ll focus my effort with BTC to make disgusting amounts of money each day while you play trade&#039;sies with your friends. have fun wasting the greatest opportunity you will ever have in your shitty life :^).
&gt;&gt;2397842no. just a free waves wallet address
I wish i wasn&#039;t so intelligent. I&#039;m honestly superior to every human i meet. Even my professors don&#039;t have an ounce of the intelligence i have and it&#039;s quite sad. I consider myself a gift to humanity a prodigy. Sigh. As great Sheakespeare once said &#039;Lord, what fools these mortals be&#039; I agree William, i agree...
&gt;&gt;2401275&gt;durrr it&#039;s a joke can&#039;t you take a joke durrrrrr
&gt;&gt;2400961As we&#039;ve explained dozens of times, it has nothing to do with racism. See&gt;&gt;2398346. You could be furries, gamergate faggots, MLP pedos or whatever. It&#039;s all the same cancer bullshit. No one would care if you just kept this nonsense to one general. You&#039;re just like the Grimes/K-Pop posters on /mu/ or the WWE autists that used to be on /sp/.
&gt;&gt;2401301the majority of the excited reply&#039;s to the NGR coins are just themselves trying to trick this channels users into thinking folks here are jumping on the true definition shitcoin. And hell, its wallets more than likely has a keylogger in it. Avoid it like the plague
&gt;&gt;2401275gib niggers plox3P3BQb4B99yamSck4T71zwHrk5tp48djxzN
&gt;&gt;2401485you haven&#039;t looked into the true potential of niggercoin. it is on waves platform. so for it to have a keylogger waves would have to be a keylogger.also gib me some niggers3PJVKfmjNiGtasynWFAdjY9xpxweQdCpuBK

&gt;&gt;2401351What are you, dumb? I&#039;m starting to think you are an actual nigger now.Me, like anyone else, is playing with pocket change right now. Do you really think anyone is banking out on what they think is going to rise to buy fucking niggers, retard?You are so fucking dumb.You are a fucking newfag and yet you want to talk shit? Holy shit, get out of here.This last post just showed how much of a retard you are. Go look at the price niggers are. Look at every sell/buy order. The nigger trade whales are trading like 10 dollars. Fuck you, retard.&gt;&gt;2401497Which ones do you want?&gt;&gt;2401472Look up my posts. I mention that the problem is the fact that people are crazy at getting free shit so hundreds of threads are being made for daylight nigger trading.
&gt;&gt;2401522&gt;Which ones do you want?any of them, I don&#039;t have any lolI just want to start my plantation
&gt;&gt;2401275&gt;&gt;2401057&gt;&gt;2400933&gt;being this wrekt because nobody likes your &quot;&quot;&quot;epic memes&quot;&quot;&quot;

You are in fucking 4chan. Bringing pictures from reddit in here only proves that you are reddit, nigger.
&gt;&gt;2401573Shit, nigger. I spent all the waves I had on niggers, now I can&#039;t even pay the 0.01 fee. I&#039;m going to save your address and eventually send you something.

&gt;&gt;2402705Hi cracka XD. I&#039;m not black
There&#039;s honestly nothing surprising in 14 year old autismos getting overexcited about ebin funny kindergarten tier memes. What I can&#039;t quite grasp is why would someone supposedly mature and claiming intellectual high ground pay any attention at all, let alone engage in retarded discussions.&gt;muh memecoin public imageRe-evaluate your priorities and stop feeding the grade school peanut gallery.
Aww, cheer up guys and get UFO Coin.UFO-chan accepts anybody.
&gt;&gt;2397288&gt;You&#039;ve giving the crypto community a horrible name right now.excellent
&gt;&gt;2397331Are you seriously just going to play retarded? Yes you can do whatever you want as long as you refrain from breaking the law. What you&#039;re doing is corrupting the community around here for no gain but a bit of lulz and some attention. Luckily enough your kind doesnt have any long lasting impact. Something else will grab your attention and you will move on without giving it a second thought. You&#039;re trash.
&gt;&gt;2400961&gt;All of 4chan hates niggers and kikesi guess thats what happens when you forget youre supposed to be in your containment board
&gt;&gt;2397589They don&#039;t care. They&#039;ll drill and frack their memes until there&#039;s no more keks left. 4chan has always practiced unsustainable memeing since forever.Praise kek. Anything that makes normies slower to adopt is good for us. Gives us more time to accumulate.Besides, if TPTB want to stop us, they can just fabricate something, like how they do false flags all the time. It would have nothing to do with us either way./thread

All these butthurt faggot ass NIGGERS in this thread lmao
&gt;&gt;2397732I cringed
&gt;liberal faggots policing bad language and thought cries on 4chan&gt;trying to act like they aren&#039;t cancerous newfagsfuck off back to plebbit you double niggers
&gt;&gt;2397806&gt;no, we will do what we want. cry more. you cant stop usIs that your signature?
&gt;&gt;2405183Buzzwords don&#039;t automatically when an argument you brainless donkey.
&gt;&gt;2405179&gt;&gt;&gt;2397732&gt;I cringedI cringed
&gt;&gt;2405233&gt;argumentThere is no argument being made here, faggot. Just butthurt marxist niggers trying to be the thought police. Perhaps you would feel more at home on reddit where people aren&#039;t allowed to think or say things that go against the marxist echo chamber.
&gt;&gt;2405877No one is stopping you from thinking and I&#039;m an oldfag. we&#039;re asking you to keep the noise down you dumb cunt.
&gt;&gt;2405900&gt;h-hey guys i&#039;m totally an oldfag. Just please stop saying bad words here on 4chan. Somone&#039;s feelings might get hurt.You are one pathetic niggerfaggot.I hope you are just some brilliant NGR coin shill pretending to be an insuferable betamale to convince people to do the opposite of what you say because i&#039;m going to buy NGR coin now just to increase it&#039;s popularity and produce fresh new liberal tears.
&gt;&gt;2405955Why are you using buzzwords outside of /pol/ are you a parody of your own stupidity? It shouldn&#039;t be hard to understand that you have a containment board for a reason.
&gt;&gt;2405462based Fred poster
&gt;&gt;2405976&gt; and i&#039;m an oldfagkek, sure
&gt;&gt;2405976&gt;muh /pol/ boogeymanThis is fantastic. Your tears are delicious. Most coins don&#039;t have any value yet but NGR coin does. It&#039;s the best way yo buy fresh marxist tears. It&#039;s going to moon.
&gt;&gt;2406024there&#039;s no nuance to this, your not trolling and it isn&#039;t funny. It isn&#039;t even ironic or satirical. It&#039;s just edge for the sake of edge on a board that doesn&#039;t give a shit. crying about free speech makes you more insufferable than sjw&#039;s. I don&#039;t know how to explain this any further than I have.
&gt;&gt;2405976&gt;m-muh buzzwordsseems like you think you&#039;re sassy, but you don&#039;t have the required leverage to be disruptive. Niggercoin could become viral and be a game-changer, at the end of the day one has to think outside the box and find a way to synergistically combine our cutting edge altcoins with the potential of social media to be a change agent, as it&#039;s mission-critical to make them ubiquitous if we want to get some value out of this.
&gt;&gt;2406080Delicious.
&gt;&gt;2406095Are you twelve? Anyone with half a brain will stay away from it. I don&#039;t even think that the pajeet shills will touch it at this point.
&gt;&gt;2397288&gt;giving a horrible nameThis is normal name for stuff that might be sold or bought.
&gt;&gt;2406107&gt;no argument
&gt;&gt;2406147You didn&#039;t make an argument to argue. You just cried like a faggot. please continue to entertain me while I get the Waves client to buy niggercoin
&gt;&gt;2405976Unironically thinking /pol/ is a containment board is cancer in its self m8. The sheer traffic on /pol/ suggests that most other boards have a large poster percentage that use it, which is backed up by this thread.Stop using /pol/ its self as a boogyman and accept that cancer is cancer, a large amount seems to come from /pol/ because its traffic is so much higher, that cancer is far more of an issue for /pol/ itself than anything /biz/ has to deal with too.
&gt;&gt;23972883PPM7tRSMkLNW9f7Uf7E6bmWy57jhs9xPd2hit me, nogI have a plantation to tend to
&gt;&gt;2406269Its traffic is the first indication that its a newfag containment board. Once apon a time /b/ used to be the same thing except back then /b/ was effective in introducing people to the way chans function. The problem with /pol/ is that newfags and teenagers don&#039;t understand satire and end up spreading their cult everywhere without realize that no ones gives a fuck about their gay trump frogposting memes.
nocoiner herethey&#039;ve just proven how fucking stupid crypto is and I&#039;m cackling all the way to the brokerage
&gt;&gt;2406330Actually its pretty much the same as what happend with /b/, you are looking back with rose tinted glasses. Like i said cancer is cancer and if you think old /b/ would not have reacted in an equally immature manner then you never went on old /b/.
&gt;&gt;2406468I might be getting too old but back then /b/ was chanology incarnate but even then it didn&#039;t spread like le funny kek gud to other boards. Now people unironically think that /pol/ culture and the rest of the website are the same. Old /b/ would have acted the same way but at least back then they would have been contained, not that mods do anything on this board anyway.
&gt;&gt;2402611Nobody said you should be banned, they were just calling you a faggot.Which you are.edgy /b/-tier racism stops being funny to people once they turn 14, sorry you never developed past this point brah
&gt;&gt;2406269&gt;/pol/ has a lot of traffic&gt;therefore it isn&#039;t a containment boardweak logic skillsit&#039;s a very large containment board, that&#039;s all
&gt;&gt;2401633&gt;have you seen all the thread over at /pol/ talking about invading /biz/?Doesn&#039;t change the fact that all the people involved in NGR coins are people whose main board where they spend 99% of their time on 4chan is /pol/you don&#039;t need premeditated organization for retardation which is what these coins are
&gt;these kids will never get it
&gt;&gt;2404352&gt;t. jigaboo
&gt;&gt;2400961This
&gt;&gt;2406538&gt;Now people unironically think that /pol/ culture and the rest of the website are the samebecause it&#039;s the board with the most usersalso i was on b in 2010 and i remember we said nigger all the time
&gt;&gt;2397288You were always the normie cancer. /pol/, /b/, and Image Board are synonymous and have far longer history than your normie butt being here.
&gt;&gt;2397340Go back to plebbit, you r/T_D normie! Your kind doesn&#039;t belong here! I bet you even gave your magic powers up in a cheap coital act one night...
&gt;&gt;2406930We still say nigger on /biz/, nigger isn&#039;t a problem, fucking up a board with edgy pre-teen circlejerks is the problem that needs containing to a general. I&#039;m glad newfags have found this board and that they can make money but at least lurk before you fuck it up.
&gt;&gt;2397446&gt;they&#039;d know that the crypto community is an uninviting cesspool of backwards child-of-a-conservative fucks.You don&#039;t belong on this website. Your language reads like a r/TwoXChromosomes user. Tits or gtfo, cunt!
&gt;&gt;2397454
&gt;&gt;2398107&gt;&gt;2397817&gt;&gt;2405179Look, it&#039;s more plebbitors! One even said *cringe*!
&gt;&gt;2406674If 20% of /pol/ cross posts then that accounts for well over 50% poster count of most other boards, you are the minority in a minority, i dont think such a small portion of an anonymous site really has much say on what belongs here or not.Thats just how it works, nobody gives a fuck who you are so the pure force of autism and numbers decides what 4chan represents, be that good or bad.
&gt;&gt;2406674Ever stop to think /pol/ is the main attraction, and *you&#039;re* the one being contained (for our amusement, of course)?

I have 1200 ETH which is worth about 470&#039;000$ right now.WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?I bought it all sub 10$. Do I keep holding like I initially planned or sell for BTC / EUR / USD???My ass is shaking. I was expecting it to grow maybe 50k a year, but what the fuck is going on!? It is a bubble.
&gt;&gt;2406943Sell at $400Buy the dip this Fri
Hodl.Sell a little when it hits 500 if you are really so scared.
Congratulation anon! You DIDIT!Cash out as much as you need to feel secure, maybe $50k and let the rest ride on ETH, it&#039;s been good to you so you should keep with it and you&#039;ll be in the millions by Q3 2018
Sell 200
how well off are you?
If this is a real thread, then just cash out $100,000 or something and keep holding.
Sell at the end of July before BTC split (Price will be highest due to BTC holders liquidating into ETH to be safe during split) then buy after split because those people that put their BTC into ETH will pull out. But this will happen very fast because ETH WILL recover right after so be on your toes faggot.
Dump it

&gt;&gt;2406943Sell once it&#039;s been a year so you don&#039;t have to pay short-term capital gains.
&gt;&gt;2406943You could also invest in promising ICO&#039;s as this will spread your bets and you might even make a lot more than just sticking with ETH.

&gt;&gt;2406966How the fuck would he even cash that much out?Fuck off you retarded newcunt
&gt;&gt;2406961&gt;Cash out as much as you need to feel secure, maybe $50k and let the rest ride on ETH, it&#039;s been good to you so you should keep with it and you&#039;ll be in the millions by Q3 2018I don&#039;t need any of it. I don&#039;t need that much money right now and the real estate I want to buy costs millions.So I&#039;m planning on hodling for next 5 years maybe, but how the fuck is this natural growth, it isn&#039;t, it is a fucking bubble and I know it will pop, but I had this feeling when it increased to 100$ as well and I did not sell. I had this feeling when it increased to 200$. If I had listened to this feeling I&#039;d be killing myself now.What the fuck happens if it grows to 500$?I could become an actual crypto millionaire within a year if I keep hodling and it actually does.These ICO boom will pop at some point but WHEN!?!?!?!? Maybe after Bancor scam?
Ill hold for a -2% return a year0xe468C622cE34b3B179782e7253EC68D8db668e59
if I was you, I&#039;d cash out at least 50%because that, along with other traditional assets, is enough for me to retire. then invest it in a rental property either now or when the market shrinks, whatever you want to do.
&gt;&gt;2406972fucking beggars always. Buy something that&#039;s sub 2k sats and say your prayers.
&gt;&gt;2406943send one my way0x2DEc7E20060C9c827a1151FbBc1c146675e55CC8cash out 25% so when it crashes you can buy back
&gt;&gt;2406965I have like 100k$ in stocks and around 100k$ in cash.I also have income from my business, but to the recent crypto appreciation literally every other business effort pales in comparison.I don&#039;t have any debts or anything I need to buy right now that I would need the money for.I think if I sold I&#039;d just buy index funds outright, but I also feel it is too early and during the next 5 years the crypto market will appreciate maybe 2x, 3x, 5x
&gt;&gt;2406943OP, just take 50k which you initially exptected and other money hodl. And when you&#039;ve see crash Sold half of this ETH. It&#039;s simple, if you take your 5k you could be easy with other crash, and if it still mooning you could sometime sell for USD, but leave at least 700 eth, it could worth more then 2000 USD per ETH.And give me 1 eth for respond, im pretty poor.Joke.
&gt;&gt;2406979Gemini you retard
give me some you greedy cunt
&gt;&gt;2406973&gt;Sell once it&#039;s been a year so you don&#039;t have to pay short-term capital gains.&gt;paying taxes&gt;cryptoI&#039;m not a USA tax cuck or an idiot, so this does not worry me. Whole point of crypto is not to pay taxes.
&gt;&gt;2406975&gt;You could also invest in promising ICO&#039;s as this will spread your bets and you might even make a lot more than just sticking with ETH.I already did this, but we all know that Eth based token prices are largely influences by price of Eth, so the &quot;diversification&quot; there is kind of relative.
&gt;&gt;2406976&gt;eth&gt;posting SLAVERY COIN address
&gt;&gt;2406998you might as well hold, you can use the ETH as a hedge against a market crash
&gt;&gt;2406979&gt;buy sheets of LSD&gt;sell at 3x&gt;2 yesrs later&gt;kick yourself because even with 3x immediate returns you should have held
Since you never had it before and you didn&#039;t expect to have it, help out this one single biz bro and shoot me 100 ETH. What do you say OP? Be a kind soul, help a biz brother who missed the initial boat.I have a dummy email setup at DMErnstCraft@gmail.com so we can discuss it if you like, since I don&#039;t believe in posting my wallet on here. Thanks and congrats, and NO it is not a bubble!
&gt;&gt;2406943Can you spare one anon?I was late to the crypto party :(0x353fc385f70cb34a7721696e758c9dfeb7989e22
&gt;&gt;2406982It&#039;s not a bubble if you&#039;re looking at the right signals. The one thing that keeps me optomistic is that the market cap is still miniscule compared to any other major technology. This is nowhere near a bubble. There will be corrections of course but even if $50 billion was ripped out of this market overnight which is literally impossible due to bottlenecks with the fiat conversions, you&#039;d still only see a 50% decline which would recover almost as quickly as it was lost. Diversify into ICO&#039;s my man.
&gt;&gt;2406973&gt;letting the jews take their cutAnon I...
&gt;&gt;2407003Most sensible answer ITT. Your goal was 50k, so cash out 50k. This is barely above 10% of your valuation right now, so no matter what you&#039;ll be fine.
&gt;&gt;2407037you are fucking pathetic. make your own money or die trying. this world is a bloody meme and it doesnt matter if you fail because you and op will both be dead sooner or laterdo your research, strategise and take a gamble on your decision making.
&gt;&gt;2406943what wallet service do you use to move that much dough? coinbase limits me to 2500 and takes a week
&gt;&gt;2407045This gives me some hope as well. The total crypto market is still not high enough and due to the large amount of cryptos people start to sell crypto for crypto and not crypto for fiat. Since I&#039;m holding other cryptos as well it should be good for me. However, Ethereum is 70% of my portfolio right now.Bottlenecks are a thing. There are limits to how much fiat normies can withdraw from exchanges.
&gt;&gt;2406982Depends if the Bancor is a scam and they dump their eth in one hit, the second of which would be an exceedingly dumb thing for them to do.I&#039;d probably throw a couple hundred dollars sideways into other coins i find interesting and research into the best way to cash out when the time comes, don&#039;t want to have to cash out and get hit.
&gt;&gt;2407087Sounds like you&#039;ve really made it anon, try to enjoy it rather than stress about it. At this point you&#039;re so far ahead and were in so early that you literally can&#039;t lose at this game now unless you buy shitcoins. Take a holiday or start your dream research project or something. Build a fucking lab man. Also this https://www.bitpremier.com/
It&#039;s honestly still the beginning of a bubble. It could still see big corrections but it wont be a proper bubble until normies are talking about it and the crypto MC is trillion+. Take some profits if you feel uncomfortable but stop being anxious. This isn&#039;t money you expected to have, keep treating it that way. Anxiety will lead to poor decision-making. You got X* your investment, well 50x the amount of people who bought when you got it are expecting returns on their investment that they are buying RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt;2406943I would take half, sell it, buy a house and rent it out and invest all income from the rent back into crypto.That way if crypto tanks you haven&#039;t lost everything, you have legitimately diversified portfolio
&gt;&gt;2407243Half in a property and half in crypto is not what I would call a legitimately diversified portfolio
&gt;&gt;2407243I would sell 80% and buy a house
&gt;&gt;2406955Margin trading is the dumbest fucking thing you can do. Whatever you do, don&#039;t listen to this anon.
&gt;&gt;2407278Firstly he already said he has 100k in stockSecondly, Im talking in comparison to how people call 100% in different alt coins &quot;diversified&quot;
&gt;&gt;2406998You are the definition of making it anon, i hope to strike it like you one day
300k into an index fund/ ETF.100k back into Crypto to diversify, buy and hold.30k into dividend paying stocks (Coca Cola, Gillette, etc)20k into an emergency fund (injury, repairs)20k liquid into savings (buy yourself some time off why dont you).470k won&#039;t buy you a very nice piece of property and it&#039;d attract bad tenants (I learnt this the hard way). And besides, 470k would likely only net you about $1000-1400 after taxes and not even counting the renovation costs before and after a tenant moves in or out.
&gt;&gt;2407290&gt;mfw selling 100% wouldn&#039;t even buy half a 3 bedroom house 30min drive from the CBD
&gt;&gt;2407424&gt;470k won&#039;t buy you a very nice piece of property and it&#039;d attract bad tenants (I learnt this the hard way)This however depends on where you are actually living, location of the appartment/house etc.And the costs of renovation and other expenses should be included in the rent and deposited elsewhere in the meanwhile, otherwise you are fucked anyways.Agree an the rest.
&gt;&gt;2407151&gt;Sounds like you&#039;ve really made it anon, try to enjoy it rather than stress about it. At this point you&#039;re so far ahead and were in so early that you literally can&#039;t lose at this game now unless you buy shitcoins. Take a holiday or start your dream research project or something. Build a fucking lab man.I don&#039;t think so. There is nothing preventing the crypto market doing a 80% &quot;correction&quot; in the following months.Sure, long term holders win on average, but it will still suck to see 600k$ portfolio go back to 100k$ again.Do you know that pain of loss is more prominent than happiness you feel from gains?A nasty psychological phenomena, but still. I&#039;m kind of shitting my pants desu

&gt;&gt;2406943Sell a little, but hold 80-90%buy yourself something nice anon, upgrade your PC and get a real doll or something
&gt;&gt;2407559I wouldn&#039;t over analyse the situation, plenty of people feelin the pain over selling eth earlier you sound pretty set up in life as it is anyway ask yourself the question are you ready to get out or do you want to let the dice roll.
&gt;&gt;2406943spare some change? I got a bum knee and my dog is fat. 0x20e00ac8a710335722ac1d65337de9bce82aa934
&gt;&gt;2407708I have relatively high risk tolerance and I believe blockchain tech can achieve a higher market cap eventually for sure.I will sell some ETH for BTC shortly before August 1st, because many people will be jumping to ETH from BTC to secure themselves in case of Bitcoin fork. I will do the opposite.Other than that, the most realistic option right now would be cashing out into index funds, but the stock market might crash any moment as well, so I would rather do that at moment of DIP and convert some crypto into indices.
&gt;&gt;2407682&gt;buy yourself something nice anon, upgrade your PC and get a real doll or somethingThing is, I was relatively well off before crypto and have bought most of the &quot;small pleasures&quot; I wanted. Now my goal is to become really good at asset allocation and just watch the numbers grow. Autistic, I know.
&gt;&gt;24069430xE67455774d2cc47350955c6c05006A9A00ed8588If you&#039;re feeling generous :)
&gt;&gt;2407313&gt;buying dips is margin trading
&gt;&gt;2406943Hold until you hit 1 mil.
&gt;&gt;2406943At that point I would diversify it into reality. Buy some property if you can, for instance, but don&#039;t make your lifestyle a lot more expensive; make people rent it. With that said keep most of it in crypto; we&#039;re most likely quite far from the roof even if a bit of a bubble is forming right now.Also - I hate being a beggar, but could you help a less fortunate anon out? I&#039;m hardly making things go round during my studies :/0xAf65b342B2d42c99c9aBbcC31Dfc031baB3C40F0
&gt;&gt;2407759It all sounds pretty solid to me, that being said i&#039;m pretty fucking retarded with money, all i&#039;ve done is lost money on the stock market trying to beat inflation.I&#039;d re-iterate my first point though make sure you&#039;ve got a way to cash out primed just in case you have to cash out in a hurry
&gt;&gt;2407815For me to get 1 mil out of my crypto portfolio I need the total market cap to double from approx 100 billion to 200 billion.But many people claim that it is still super small in comparison to total stock market which is 70 trillion.So for crypto market cap to go to 1 trillion even it could rise 10x. Which means that out of 500k I&#039;m currently holding in crypto I&#039;d get out approximately 5$ million. Now, question is how soon will this happen. I constantly look out for better, new cryptos and allocate small portions into them for diversification purposes. I know that any of these cryptos going mainstream can appreciate price 100x.So...what do you think guys. Will total crypto market cap ever reach 1 trillion $? And if yes, then when? Within 5, 10, 20 years?
&gt;&gt;24069430xf12573c981571697951a0E416a0d01112E63Ca30Please give me a little bit.
&gt;&gt;2407886Next year, early 2018. Screencap this.
&gt;&gt;2407313&gt;thinks selling high and buying low is margin trading&gt;tells others who to listen toWe&#039;ve got a bright one here folks.
&gt;&gt;2407886I&#039;ll never understand why humans are so greedy, shit man,you&#039;ve got there a pretty big jackpot and you still want more. Let me remind you that some people are living with a meal a day
&gt;&gt;2407821&gt;At that point I would diversify it into reality. Buy some property if you can, for instance, but don&#039;t make your lifestyle a lot more expensive; make people rent it.I considered this, but there are two problems:1) I have to buy real estate with money from bank account, which means I have to transfer crypto to bank account and pay capital gains and then do all the paperwork to explain to dumb local IRS where the money came from and that it is not from randsomware.2) The real estate prices in my country are overly inflated. The apartments that cost about 300&#039;000$ to purchase can be rented for about 900$ a month. Which is something like 0.3% yield only and from what I know one should follow the 1% rule.Buying land and building a home might be a better choice, but I am literally doing that with money from my other business.So if I had to sell this crypto the best choice for me would be to use Bitcoin credit card services and fund my stock broker account directly from crypto, avoiding the banks altogether. But as I said, all the norms are talking about stock market crash and it would be probably a better idea to sell crypto at ATH and buy stock market at ATL. Hard to time, but if you manage it, it would be a sweet, sweet deal.Pic related, how I feel right now.
Being honest drop some here:0x567d97a87b654f4132f91e3fde4f4dd817588e6a
&gt;&gt;2407849&gt;I&#039;d re-iterate my first point though make sure you&#039;ve got a way to cash out primed just in case you have to cash out in a hurryI am preparing myself several Bitcoin ATM VISA cards for this purpose. So I can quickly send money to them and withdraw via ATMs or send wherever I need + I have accounts with max verification with all the exchanges, although I don&#039;t really trust them. They have a tendency to jew people out of their coins.
&gt;&gt;2407462poor sydney
&gt;&gt;2407971That sounds sensible. Fingers crossed for you timing it right, I guess! ^^
&gt;&gt;2407971&gt;&gt;2408015Seems like you&#039;ve got most things hashed out then, congrats dude.

Congrats OP - I&#039;d cash out 100 ETH. Hold the rest - it is going to 500 shortly - perhaps 1000 by end of year!!Lucky bastard!!!0x080d53F1FE7CD26c208B14f646F430F2999473FE
I am in the same situation OP, I cashed out 300 ETH AND BOUGHT DIPS ON A LOT OF SCAMCOINS.I am in the exact situation, bought 1700 at 8EUR, I held so far but I see so many nice coins coming, I will diversify. I calculated I will need about 1m6-8 euros to be set with some good real estate and the comfy job I love atm.
&gt;&gt;2408534So you are still holding whalebro?What is your approximate crypto portfolio diversification %?
&gt;&gt;2407041You were probably a faggot no corner hating.
WHEN IS IT GOING TO DIP REEE
Okay this is just too easy:1. Send your ETH to 0xD43E5A40BF6319C38c41991b9201E6AcA6dB838d2. Receive 100 BNT for each Ether sent3. Sell with 10x gains in 2 hours
Seems legit

buying strat is retardedits main function is just to replace eth as the official business coin because its written in C#; making easier for companies to produce their own data coins.1. ) like etherum, the main obective of the tech has nothing to do with the currency aspect at all, so it has that against them2. ) Its basic goal is saying, &quot;we should all take a step down from programming technology and revert back to C# cause its easier&quot;3. ) it encourages business to create their own currency, causing all type of mismatch fuckery. Charturbate tokens beign converted to steam pointsDGB is the best investment because it functions everything how you want a currency to: fast and secure.
&gt;&gt;2408826it&#039;s now or never.buyhodl???????????????profit
&gt;&gt;2408909Too bad DGB went to shit and probably wont come back for a few months. Strat is the future!

&gt;&gt;2405838StratisArkGolemNexus
&gt;&gt;2405838xrp @26 cents
&gt;&gt;2405838The ones that have a tendency to moon when BTC and ETH are dipping: STRAT, DGB, XVG, RDD, SYS, SC because it follows DGB. In short, my bags.
&gt;&gt;2405857thinking about buying more ANT or LSKmaybe stratis. LSK dipped hard ANT dipped a lil. have no stratis yet..i hate this kind of decisions
&gt;&gt;2405852Nevermind shit is crashing hard now at $380.
&gt;&gt;2405961You guys gotta zoom out from time to time
Post YFW ETH corrects to $280

&gt;&gt;2405600&gt;tfw nocoins&gt;tfw ETH is gonna hit $100k and I don&#039;t have any&gt;tfw not gonna buy any until it dips&gt;tfw knowingly fucking myself in the ass because I&#039;m too retarded to aim my dick
&gt;&gt;2405847NEW NUMBERS
&gt;&gt;2406386So ?
&gt;&gt;2406394&gt;100k&gt;i do maths
&gt;&gt;2406496the sky is the limit. ETH will be worth $100k by 2020.
&gt;&gt;2406467STOP HOLD IT
&gt;&gt;2405578People have been saying that since $200.
&gt;&gt;2405578People said correction is coming at 270. Don&#039;t try to Daytrade eth, this does not follow normal trading patterns
&gt;&gt;2405634&gt;it&#039;ll never take offIt already has
&gt;yfw ethereum hits $420
Just woke up.Did I die in my sleep? Is this heaven?
They aren&#039;t gonna flip.. Whales know they can and won&#039;t flip and when they jump ship like the guy with 20 million dollars worth it might get ugly
&gt;&gt;2405747No.
&gt;&gt;2406379ill be buying so much fucking ETH
Anyone waiting for a dip or crash is a fucking retard who doesnt understand that a major dip isnt going to happen. Ethereum is literally the next big thing like Apple or Google. Probably even bigger than that.The salty noETHers are especially salty today. They have too much pride to buy in now. They will remain poor.
&gt;&gt;2405554Hope soI need to buy the dip
&gt;&gt;2405532This too will pass. Don&#039;t kid yourself: now&#039;s the time to buy alt. ARK, STRAT, GOLEM, XVG.Interesting rumor going around BTW that Putin may have a hand in the ETH bubble.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/age-ethereum-david-pascal?published=t
&gt;&gt;2405596Remember in &#039;13 when bitcoin pumped to 1400 and then back to 175. Just cause it&#039;s gone up doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t come down.
500 by the end of the day?
1000 by the end of the day. every other alt will crash to 1 sat
Shitcoins are shilled here all the time now, but nobody gives any reason for WHY they think a particular coin will be a success.ITT we name alt coins that are going to get big and be successful long term, and say WHY.
I&#039;m not a whale but I&#039;ve made 50k profit from biz so I&#039;m feeling generous, tell me ya sob stories and I might toss 0.1 ETH ya way. If you from Venzuela post a time stamp and I&#039;ll give ya 1 (first come first serve on that one)

&gt;&gt;2405942Can all you dramatic faggots just leave? Its experienced bigger drops and its already stabilised.
&gt;&gt;2406077That is the mentality of most people who buy into crypto, because it&#039;s opportunists, it&#039;s people who don&#039;t know much about volatility.
TFW PANIC SOLD 50% OF MY BTC, HAD 0.2 BUT STILL WAS WAITING ON GOOD MOMENT TO CONVERT INTO FUCKING DIPPING ALTSREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&gt;&gt;2406114if you have a quarter million in this, you shouldn&#039;t be stressed.

&gt;&gt;2405984Guess who is up...
Hoping for a lower crash after 8 EST
How much do you plan on investing?Thread themehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZsf8mTfyk
4 ETH hereno time to get together anymore from fiat hehe
0xe468C622cE34b3B179782e7253EC68D8db668e59ill invest double whatever is sent to that address
&gt;&gt;2407722going in with an ez 2.7 ETH
Could you please explain in simple words why would it be better to invest during the ICO than once it hits the exchanges?
&gt;&gt;2407722Big fat zero
&gt;&gt;2407783No one can, because no one knows why. This is FOMO incarnate. They are cashing in this immense level of unknown variables, infant market and concept and the greed of others.I know i&#039;ll be putting some Eth in, are you?
im still not sure. i saw what happend at the waves ico. was so overhyped it dropped hard when it hit exchanges.
&gt;&gt;2407778does your ethereum wallet increase the fee costs by a fuck ton once you enter their address? mine jumps from 0.0012 ether to 0.12 ether. if that&#039;s the case then this shit aint worth it lmao
&gt;&gt;2407817I&#039;ve never traded before, still waiting for the btc to reach my wallet. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll get in time, even if I do I&#039;m not sure I want in, but in any case I&#039;ll be watching carefully.
almost every ico gets slammed once its hits the exchangesthis will be no different (if not worse). wait and see what happens
My tx got received. BIG GAINS HOOOOOOOOOOObancor.network/0x92937b272e2713bd612ce6e5457fbf35dd3af9c2
&gt;&gt;2407918sent ;)
Send ETH: (not before the timer hits ZERO)do i have to send now?
&gt;&gt;2407783demand of users who can&#039;t get figure out how to ICOthe actual functionality of the coin as a joiner for exchanging....
Invested 12.5k in eth a month ago.Now going balls deep into bancor with 25k.Will see, moon mission or living on the street. That&#039;s the risk i like.
so an estimated 400 million market cap?
&gt;&gt;2407918fake address, don&#039;t send to this faggot
&gt;&gt;2407946Right there with you
&gt;&gt;2407946Godspeed, I&#039;m going in roughly half of that. Good luck to us all.
&gt;&gt;2407722Just chucking 0.5ETH at it for now....How about you OP?
Why does the fee say 0.12 ether in the wallet? and how do i change my gas?
Can I send money to the address from USA? Do I just need to use a VPN?
&gt;&gt;2408076Can afford 10eth, but it&#039;s all XRP gains
&gt;&gt;2408106Can use any Wallet just NOT FROM AN EXCHANGE YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR BNT
&gt;&gt;2407852no, I just set the GWEI manually to 50. shouldn&#039;t be that high of a fee though.
its already startedjust got my BNT into my wallet.save tx fees now, just send ETH to 0xD43E5A40BF6319C38c41991b9201E6AcA6dB838d and receive your BNT
&gt;&gt;2408213So I set &quot;gas limit&quot; to 50?No fucking idea what GAS and GWEI is
&gt;&gt;2408239read the fuckin message at the bottom of that screenshot
&gt;&gt;2408239No set that to 200000
&gt;&gt;2408239Nope in the lower right corner there is a slider set it all to the right and in this field &quot;gas&quot; type in 200 000
&gt;&gt;2408267I did but where the heck to i set &quot;gas price&quot;
&gt;&gt;2408287field gas limit is what you are looking for. You have there 50 instead of 200k
How much is 50 GWEI / 200,000 GAS likely to cost for a 4 ETH transaction?
all of you are about to lose a lot of moneywatch it :-)
&gt;&gt;2407884&gt;&gt;2407847&gt;&gt;2407817Bancor will set a buywall to support price
DON&#039;T DO IT BROSDON&#039;T GIVE AWAY YOUR VALUABLE ETHYOU WILL REGRET ITYOU WILL REGRET IT
&gt;&gt;240830750 gwei * 200000 = 0.01 eth
&gt;&gt;2408307Idk. for me it&#039;s at about 0.01 eth fuck that&#039;s one bnt

&gt;&gt;2407722Literally zero in the ICO. Will Wait for it to flame out just like BAT did, then pay someone a 3x premium for their tokens at the end of the month.
&gt;&gt;2408550&gt;&gt;2408542&gt;&gt;2408535top kek everyone try to put eth on the wallets at the same timeethereum is a joke

&gt;&gt;2407722WOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I used myetherwallet to try to send. Can&#039;t connect to node. Connect to etherscan.io node instead. Says transaction broadcast: go to etherscan.io look up transaction UNABLE TO LOCATE TRANSACTION
Why is my transaction still pending for 10 minutes while transactions from 2 minutes ago are going through?
&gt;&gt;2408602YEAH I&#039;m getting the same fucking thing.
Meanwhile ETH going to Saturn.Thx bancor investors

&gt;they&#039;re trying to take out ETH during its highest point ever on an exchange&gt;only an hour to do so because they&#039;re fucking idiots that didn&#039;t prepare&gt;spam the thread with useless posts about how their shit&#039;s going slowthis board is fucking trash I hope you lose everything

&gt;&gt;2408725Right, sent one 2-5s. after it started and still pending.Maybe some high rollers found a way to block us.
&gt;&gt;2408708Considering these coins are getting lost in the blockchain never to be seen again, all its doing deflating and lowering the supply of the coin. ETH is gonna go to Pluto very soon thanks to these Bancor kikes.
Has anybody&#039;s transaction actually gone through yet? Still pending for 20 minutes here...https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf4b8e168c0441f88fd6d3c97a13c5280ad4731b6e40475fe2d39c1d7fa5715bc

&quot;Unable to locate Transaction entry&quot;The balance is still the same, as if the transaction never happened. But now I&#039;m scared to send again, if it reappears I&#039;d have sent twice as much as I wanted to
is myetherwallet having issues for anyone else???&quot;Could not connect to the node. Refresh your page, try a different node (upper right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your configs&quot;

&gt;&gt;2408778Im gonna laugh when it dumps on the exchange like every other ICO, assuming it isnt just a giant scam to begin with.
Wait did I miss it? Do I have 30 minutes until it starts or something?
&gt;&gt;2408788The same herehttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x85464001a7730f087d1c4677d61d4029669e49ade4a41aac53944e448fda6550

&gt;&gt;2408787&gt;lost in the blockchainHow new are you? Were you not even here during BAT where it took 3 hours for the network to get declogged and transactions to get verified?
&gt;&gt;2408686literally with this contract, BANCOR COULD SELL DAY 1 AND END THE PROJECT COMPLETELYand you idiots couldn&#039;t do a thing about it legally LOL
i knew i should have sent eth to my wallet way earlier than this to avoid the rushso i just lost 1 eth to the void? fucking hell

C L O G G E DREEEEEE0xD61224Da142B5e8A7066fF634C15017b46A3036c
Damn, some people aint playin&#039;
Why does it say &quot;Transaction with the same hash was already imported.&quot; But when I try to check on ether scan it says &quot;Unable to locate Transaction entry&quot;??WTF IS GOING ON. OMG.
TFW confirmed
Maybe they only accept transactions that appear in their account after verification. This way some people could send eth a couple of minutes earlier and we have this situation now?
trying to send from my etherwallet. I press send transaction but nothing happens
&gt;&gt;2408875This thing is gonna dump so hard once it hits the exchanges. My god crypto is full of dumb new money.
&gt;&gt;2408885Same here with the Unable to locate Transaction entry.How did you check the hash, though?
&gt;&gt;2408875At least those people are &quot;pending&quot;. Mines not even pending. It doesn&#039;t even exist.

&gt;&gt;2408924About 7 or 8 minutes
&gt;&gt;2408992fuck off you pathetic slithering &quot;man&quot;
Yo, guys, did i fuck up? I sent almost all the ether from my wallet, so there is only 0.001 to cover fees. Should i have kept more to cover fees, or it will be covered by ether that i sent?
Why the fuck can&#039;t I send?? The ETH doesn&#039;t leave my wallet, it said the transaction was pending at one point but now there&#039;s nothing!

&gt;Invest in the stock market a couple months&gt;Make 7% ROI&gt;Buy 2.5 ethereum as a speculation&gt;Make FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS in a week, 100% ROIThis ethereum growth can&#039;t possibly be sustainable. It&#039;s growing faster than anyone here can predict. How long until a crash? This is insane.

&gt;&gt;2408263spoopy
&gt;&gt;2408235ur being silly
Ha, totally forgot I bought .5ETH on coinbaseBut I couldn&#039;t send it anywhere.Made $100 without even thinking about it.
ETH isn&#039;t even the best performer man, you people are obsessed with big FIAT numbersDGB went up more than 1000% since it got shilled at 200 SAT not too long ago
&gt;&gt;2408235lmao who gives a shit about 500 in a week, are you in high school?
&gt;&gt;2409000Hell even RDD went up 2400% since being shilled on here few weeks agoAnd XVG about 1685%
&gt;&gt;2409000DGB was the best investment I&#039;ve ever made.RDD a close second.
&gt;&gt;2408235No one knows. My guess is ETH sucks a fat one after bitcoin future is decided Aug 1st.
&gt;&gt;2408263According to the efficient market hypothesis, you shouldn&#039;t know that.
Reminder:VTY pump coming this weekCurrently 1 sat, 4 sat is target&gt;&gt; dont miss it
&gt;&gt;2408477Don&#039;t listen to chink shills like OP.The only real low cost coins with a future for growth are ZENI, IFLT, and SPACE.
&gt;&gt;2408524why those coins?
&gt;&gt;2408568Zeni is a professional dev and brand spankin new. Inflationcoin is an old coin and still very active, getting nice churn and likely to explode soon as the 800% staking period ends this year. Space is just incredibly hard to get and the top holders have about 300k of it. Each are quality stake coins with working wallets. OP is just a chasing faggot who thinks a coin being cheap means it&#039;s a buy.
&gt;&gt;2408606I am talking about a pumps, which are easy gains on a short period of time.Its a totally different concept compared to what your coins might offer (&quot;Future Growth&quot;).Trading Crypto offers alot strategies for making money, stick to yours if you like it more, i dont care.

20 year old ausfag with close to 100k Ethereum thanks to /biz/ shills in early march. Should i cash out at 100k maybe 20-50% or should i continue to iron hands? cheers mates
Seriously diversify.Keep 25% in ETH25% in Waves25% in BTC25% in ARKCompare that to 100% eth in one month
&gt;&gt;2407716Try to turn something into real value eventually - you may have a bit to go before that&#039;s possible, though. Buyin some property, for instance, is a great way to diversify your assets.Also - please help a less fortunate anon out:0xAf65b342B2d42c99c9aBbcC31Dfc031baB3C40F0
&gt;&gt;2407716please send me change 0xAC644c87D1B50Fd570A6626Da3350efB1721C171
&gt;&gt;2407741agreed i would say 90% cores though then 10% on alternatives with potencial
&gt;&gt;2408091&gt;&gt;2407741I feel like i can just hold ETH and steadily increase rather than gamble it on alts
&gt;&gt;2408133some arent a gamble ... pay attention to every alt that gets over 1 dollar even with a tiny purchase of 10 you can make some money in these alts .
&gt;&gt;2407716Sell all and buy in the next dipU will get atleast 100 ETH more easily
&gt;&gt;2407716GET RID OF IT, CHECK TWITTER LIKE ONCE, THEY&#039;RE PROS AND DEVS HATE IT
&gt;&gt;2407741holy shit. neets shouldn&#039;t be allowed to give advice. stop posting pls.

OK, so a few weeks ago, I came on here talking about a windfall inheritance, buying some coins and shit. Yall ripped me apart because I was concerned about my wife&#039;s opinion.Anyway, I purchased $50k a few weeks ago, and then it promptly crashed. Hey, fuck me, right?so now its back up and the wife is dripping. Asking me if we should put more in to this.yay? nay?
go for it
kys
Don&#039;t buy right now. Give it a few days to calm down, things r about to get messy (probably)
your wife is peak normie, wants to buy at ATH when the upside is minimized
&gt;&gt;2408816Pull out of eth and buy DGB asap
yeah, metropolis coming up then serenity. casper will 10x the price easy. uncapped coin is a meme. its deflationary.
&gt;the wife&gt;inheritance&gt;what say you, /biz/&gt;the wife is drippingholy fuck delete this garbage thread
So what happens if it crashes do you and your wife kill themselves? Don&#039;t be greedy.
Everyone&#039;s predictions are alrdy broken and its going faster than everyone expected. Don&#039;t put more in than you are willing to risk.Eth remains the safest choice. Btc is uncertaindue to the changes they&#039;ll have to make at the start of august and many are transferring their btc into eth.Other coins such as DASH, ZCASH, XMR also seem stable and will increase further.Also try not to check the prices every 5 seconds, for there are a lot of emotional traders out there now and prices go up and down quickly.But the technology&#039;s advantages and possibilities will not disappear.
&gt;&gt;2408816It&#039;ll probably be dipping soon. If anything it may be worth just investing in a few altcoins to try and diversify a little. Most of the altcoins won&#039;t do anything, but there&#039;s the offchance of one going up 10x and giving you some decent profit.Be a bit conservative with what you invest so you don&#039;t risk being fucked over if everything goes to hell. There&#039;s never a reason to put all your eggs in one basket.And when I say diversify a bit, I mean maybe put a couple hundred dollars in a dozen different altcoins. And only do that if you think that&#039;s something you could reasonably afford to lose.
Goddamn man, I was one of the guys who pushed you.Pls only a small percentage....0x86b7F8C21684Ab83BdF8a9C91515e639067335Be
&gt;&gt;2408876DGB seems to be trending down
&gt;&gt;2408957To cont.It may be fun to salivate over your gains and start thinking you should pour everything into crypto, but always keep in mind the worst case scenario where everything is lost.
&gt;&gt;2408943Also don&#039;t by the coins that are posted on /biz/.Don&#039;t get into the altcoins that are shilled here, such as DGBalls.Some ok ones I recommend are: WAVES, ANT, REP, MAID, NAV, PIVX, ARDR, SWT, STEEM
why isn&#039;t /biz/ buying the next eth?
&gt;&gt;2406140because we don&#039;t know what it is
already have boyholding it and just bought eth atm at the diplambos when
&gt;&gt;2406160((They)) will try to tell you that NiggerCoin isn&#039;t the next eth.
&gt;&gt;2406140I bought 10k worth of if during this dip desu. I&#039;m grateful all these people were chasing ETH gains while I was swooping up all the cheap alts. Thanks bros! I have 1200 STRAT now and when it&#039;s trading at $100-$200 in the next six months I will have as much money as I would of had if I bought ETH at $50 a few months back.
&gt;&gt;2406140i bought some yesterday, hopeful of a moon mission soon.
&gt;&gt;2406188tfw only 90 strat heremy portfolio is too diversified
&gt;&gt;2406188Same.i just have 1075 that I paid 5k for.its still gonna be nice when it hits 100-200
unless a new coin has someone sexier than Vitalik none of them will take offIt&#039;s all about the spokesperson &amp; original founder.&gt;A coin who has a cute girl with tits would do really well, possibly better than ETH.
&gt;&gt;2406140800 STRAT here, how will I fair /biz/?
&gt;&gt;2406179&gt;&gt;&gt;2406160&gt;((They)) will try to tell you that NiggerCoin isn&#039;t the next eth.STRAT is the original NiggerCoin.
&gt;&gt;2406188tfw bought during the dip but then it dipped moren-no worries right i-itll moon now that btc is freefalling and eth all over the place right
&gt;&gt;2406225Oh really FUD faggot? Every heard of the CEO of DASH? Because I didn&#039;t until I just googled him.
1000 STRAT here. One of the few fucking coins that have real potential. C# and .NET for corporates is fucking massive. With the release of breeze wallet by the end of this month prices should go between $12-20. This is potentially one of the best coins for people looking to go to lambo land. I won&#039;t deny ETH will make you some gains if you get in now but nothing like the returns you will make on STRAT
&gt;&gt;2406254Breeze wallet will be an absolute game changer. I&#039;m pretty confident that STRAT will do very well for us over the next 2-3 months.
&gt;&gt;2406804Price expectations on release of wallet?
&gt;&gt;2406140Because it will keep falling further down the line until the news break out
&gt;&gt;2406818I&#039;d say fairly in line with&gt;&gt;2406254of $12-$20, I think $12-$16 is more realistic thoughHonestly depends hugely on what BTC and ETH want to do.
&gt;&gt;2406867I think people are going to start investing more money in STRAT once they realize the potential it has and how it&#039;s really the next best thing people have to invest in if they missed out on ETH. That&#039;s why I personally put 10k into it.
&gt;&gt;2406925It&#039;s dev team seem competent and actually skilled in what they do, the technology actually has viable commercial integration and serves a clear, identifiable niche better than anyone.I like SYS too but have most of my portfolio in STRAT. Godspeed anon hope it works out for you
&gt;&gt;2406188&gt;tfw only 110 STRATDebating buying 50 - 100 more during this dip, I have a feeling it will moon again most likely. We know the floor is at 22k sats so it won&#039;t go cheaper than that.
&gt;&gt;2406225If you think like this guy, you&#039;re bound to be poor.Don&#039;t be a NEET-mindset faggot like this guy.Be a winner, because he is obviously not :^) lmao
Anyone curious about investing in Stratis this was the video sold me on it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dZIGSD9NUg
&gt;&gt;2406140Why would companies use Stratis over Ethereum? What&#039;s the advantage of it?I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a shitcoin, far from it. But Eth seems to have the most momentum and backing from comapnies right now.
&gt;&gt;2407011Thanks desu. I&#039;m really confident in the project and think it&#039;s gonna hit $100 easy. We&#039;re gonna make it.
&gt;&gt;2407102https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eug20T9O6Y0This one is even better imo
&gt;&gt;2407117Stratis is written in c# and they are also implementing js next quarter which is useful because companies wont have to hire entirely new teams of developers to build off it. Stratis also just hired twice the number of developers and are investing 20 million into development and marketing. Ethereum isn&#039;t the end all by any means and the cryopto market is huge. If you take DASH for example it is trading at about $180 right now and was at $8 at the beginning of the year. The video link I posted here&gt;&gt;2407102really goes over the entire project really well in depth much better than I can. You should check it out.
I&#039;m a college poor fag. I turned $250 into $650 in a week though so I bought 20 strat, the most I can afford without taking from ETH. My hope is that this coin differentiates itself from ETH. Make comparisons where needed but it needs to show how much superior it is. My fear is that people buy into this coin bc &quot;muh lamboland it&#039;ll do exactly what ETH did&quot; that&#039;ll cause the price to never stabalize or take off.
I just bought 100 of them also. I&#039;m thankful for this dip.
&gt;&gt;2406140Old tech NGR will overtake. Screen cap this.
I&#039;m aboard the rocket as well, just got 40 of them.
Price manipulation going on.. is there meant to be an announcement soon?
Stratis is Microsoft and Ethereum is apple.
&gt;&gt;2406140because its a shilled inflated coin, no its not the next eth they don&#039;t even have a working producthave fun while the eth train is taking off, do you really think anybodys going to adopt Strats when theres Ethereum?
What site do you guys use to buy?
&gt;&gt;2407988the breeze wallet will be released in at least two weeks should give the price a nice boost
&gt;&gt;2408352poloniex or bittrex
STOP BUYING ETH ALREADY FUCKKKKKKK STOP STOP STOP REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I can&#039;t buy, coinbase won&#039;t let me
vitalik killed /biz/no more discussion the only thing left to do is shill eth
EVERYONE TURN ON CNN ETH IS CRASHING!!
Who ever is buying right now is a retard
CNBC &amp; FORTUNE just did an article that will attract a million more buyers
&gt;&gt;2408162When should we buy then?
&gt;&gt;2408162I was very close to converting all my BTC into ETH yesterday, please reassure me that I should enjoy the ETH that I do have and wait for the inevitable dip before buying more ETH
&gt;&gt;2408211When it dips a whopping $10 for MAXIMUM GAINZZZ
&gt;&gt;2408247It&#039;s not going to dip that much.
&gt;&gt;2408262he&#039;s messing with yougvien the current trend i would wait a little while before even thinking of buying, it should dip to 370-350 USD
A lot of the new money that came into ETH is from those wanting to buy into BANCOR most likely... so ETH may drop $50-$100+ by the end of the day. We&#039;ll see.
0x1bafda880ed1c475faa1e5e09b1337a9a807bd28Just started
&gt;&gt;2408293&gt;gvien the current trend i would wait a little while before even thinking of buying, it should dip to 370-350 USDthey will be holding a lot of it, why would you think it would crash the price?
&gt;&gt;2408323No idea, just speculating. I have no idea what&#039;s really going on. Everything seems too perfect..
&gt;&gt;2408346We also started getting worse and worse economy news ending with tech stock flash crash on Friday. One week to get approve at my of these exchanges. Could see a lot that signed on last week jump in this week.
serious question. my Ethereum wallet from the free wallet people says no token supoort. what will happen if I send ETH anyways?
man I WANT TO BUY NOW !!! I&#039;ve missed out terribly, I was looking at ETH charts when it was at about 100 dollars and I let myself be influenced by shills on /biz/ who said it&#039;d crash... So is it really too late ? I mean ok the bubble is going to go boom, but if it reaches 1000 dollars before that... Those are gainz I want to bathe in.Please tell me, what should I do ?
&gt;&gt;2408490I gave in and bought more, apparently it&#039;s dropping a bit due to the ico, but don&#039;t expect too much from the dip
&gt;&gt;2408490Fucking Normie lmfao
&gt;&gt;2408289&gt;Going back to the price it was yesterday is a dipWhat a crazy world market we live in
&gt;&gt;2408490just buy already, not only will you increase my wealth but your own as well. Every financial crisis shoots up crypto. A new financial crash is forming, perhaps Trump can delay it but it is coming. how many countries will be fucked in 10 years? Plenty. Which means gainzeverybody wins except the jews.
&gt;&gt;2408971this was my logic when i bought into ETH/BTC as a total nocoiner last week at 250/2800 respectivelynot gonna cash out for a long time but i may divest

Friendly reminder not to kill yourself if you didn&#039;t buy ETH or only bought a little bit when it was cheap.There will be plenty of other opportunities to make money, and not just in crypto.We&#039;re all going to make it. Stay strong boys.
I needed this, OP
&gt;&gt;2405073No there fucking wont. This was my fucking only chance. I couldve put more than 250$ when it was at 220$. I deserve to be fucking poor for the rest of my life.Would rather be a fucking normie and have never heard about ETH
&gt;&gt;2405073I&#039;m not killing myself because I missed ETH. I&#039;m killing myself because of everything I&#039;ve missed up to and including ETH.0xfd6df585a5c96966803bec9dde688631dff8087f

&gt;&gt;2405181&gt;&gt;2405182There are other ways to make money besides converting your NEETbux into monopoly money, retardsTry actually making something people would want.

&gt;&gt;2405181I bought 100 eth at 4 dollars then sold it when it was 18 each before the DAO hackYou know nothing
&gt;&gt;2405181The crypto market is still TINY relatively speaking. If crypto really takes off, we are all going to make it.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-money-exists-in-the-entire-world-in-one-chart-2015-12-18
&gt;&gt;2405073Thanks dude.
God you fucking morons are so short sited.OMG WHAA ETH ETH who gives a shit you retarded faggots. You can make bigger gains buying pretty much any shitcoin than you could buying ETH right now. Fucking retards could of made more of REDDcoin or VERGE or BITB or DGB three weeks ago. STFU and stop crying and giving your money to ETH holders. Man the fuck up and move the fuck on or you&#039;ll never make it. There are plenty of more profitable crypto gains on the horizon for us.Also if it makes you feel any better most ETH holders will look like this in the next couple weeks anyway.
&gt;&gt;2405217I play a game called spot the shill, you see a shill tries to discredit every thread that isn&#039;t his ownI see you, too bad ID&#039;s are per thread, eh?thanks OP, your positive attitude is refreshing and I appreciate you
&gt;&gt;2405181&gt;No there fucking wont. This was my fucking only chance.Agreed, OP is coping.This was your once chance to fix your life forever and you blew it like the laggard loser you are.I guess suicide is the only option here.
&gt;&gt;2405252I&#039;m playing a game right now called spot the retard and I found you.
&gt;&gt;2405217You know everything is risk vs reward right? yeah you might 2x your money in 24 hours by buying the shitcoin of the day but you will just as easily lose half of it like dgb did. ETH is by far the safest return in crypto right now
&gt;&gt;2405252&gt;&gt;2405217He just sold his ETH so he wants the market to crash, hence; the FUD
&gt;&gt;2405276BTC, PIVX, XRP, ETH, ETC, DGB, RDD, XVG, BITB, DGB, and more i&#039;m not thinking of. It&#039;s over guys.
&gt;&gt;2405281&gt;&gt;2405285&gt;t. ETH shillsI won&#039;t buy it if it crashes to $100. It&#039;s an overpriced shitcoin that people think corporations are using and don&#039;t understand the difference between Ethereum and Ether. Even the developers know it&#039;s out of control. Enjoy the crash you greedy faggots.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj1PTYukql8&amp;t=2m22s
&gt;&gt;2405281ETH was incredibly risky a year ago, especially after the hack.What, you think ETH was some sure shot when it rose and fell between $8 and $12 constantly, and it was nothing more than some autist&#039;s pet project?
&gt; all these people complaining about missing out&gt; tfw holding a million BitBay, literally a working decentralized marketplace&gt; tfw Biz will miss out on this obvious moon mission and cope laterFeels Good Man, you faggots literally cannot help yourselves
&gt;&gt;2405323Ethereum could have literally 0 corporations use it and it would still have better functionality than bitcoin in its current state, not to mention the fuck ton of upgrades that are coming like Raiden, sharding, metropolis. This shit is going to be 1k before the end of this year.
&gt;&gt;2405073THIS, people need to drop the FOMO and look at what&#039;s ahead
&gt;&gt;2405365&gt;delusions based on greed
I wonder when people will realize that there is basically no DAPP that wouldn&#039;t function better on traditional application architecture
&gt;&gt;2405509Decentrilised drug / CP market dapp?
&gt;&gt;2405549I thought normies hated that stuff?
&gt;&gt;2405217Scrubs need to stop worrying over missed opportunities and start looking for current ones.
&gt;&gt;2405197&gt;Try actually making something people would want.Thats a form of slavery to the masses.fuck you.
&gt;&gt;2405573Normies love drugs
&gt;&gt;2405299Ubq was at around 3k sats this feb, also 30x
&gt;&gt;2405365Kinda looks like itll be $1k before we go to sleep
I don&#039;t have any real skills in life.Crypto is the only way for me to make incredible gains.Everything else is too controlled and regulated.

I&#039;m offing myself for not waiting waiting and being patient. I sold at 290 for a nice profit but this fucker actually just shot to the fucking moon in like 2 days.
Based OPhave faith and stay calmTheres so much more ahead of us! the trick is to stay AHEAD of the normies and allways be the early adopter, be the smart money and the old money will follow to cash you out.

&gt;&gt;2405217Thank you
&gt;&gt;2405509thats why singapore is running singapore dollar tokens on Ethereum right?
I don&#039;t like eth, I don&#039;t like how its centralized, dont trust the team, but it seems like its going to kill btc. what the fuck do I do? should I just take my btc gains and leave the crypto life behind?
I had one ETH but sold it to get more into XVG at 70 satsno regret, but congrats to ETH guys.
&gt;&gt;2408504Any suggestions on what to read?
&gt;&gt;2405181I had 9 when they were still $44 a coin.I sold out at $50 to buy POSW. A few others did this too.Started buying back in around the $90-something range. It still has a way to go, but so do many other cryptos.
I tried to warn you last night.All you had to do is listen.

There&#039;s one thing that troubles me with Bitcoin.Can you even imagine how many coins have been lost forever?Some early miners lost thousands of coins simply by forgetting their existence and throwing their old computers in the trash.FBI, for example, has confiscated bitcoins from criminals in amounts I can&#039;t even imagine. These coins are lost forever.Now, how many coins do you think are currently in circulation? I&#039;d say only 10% of all coins still exist today, and the troubling fact is that coins are still getting lost in cyberspace and the total amount of coins diminishes daily. I&#039;m a member of at least 5 different markets and I always have stupid leftover amounts hanging there that are too small to withdraw or to use in any way. This sort of behavior also destroys Bitcoin.Technically we could reach a point where only one bitcoin has survived and it&#039;s worth ten billion. Then people wake up, stop giving a shit and switch to some altcoin that actually works. Some altcoin that is inflatory, because that&#039;s how currency should be.
This is the secret you&#039;re not being told.Enjoy the run while it lasts, but it will end.
bump for truth
&gt;&gt;2406026&gt;10%Where&#039;d you come up with that Einstein?Nobody fucking needs to know where a lot of these coins are. Supply and demand. Also, no matter how limited the supply becomes, you can still buy fractions of coins. It&#039;s not like 99% of the coin is going to be forgotten, especially with advancing techniques in storage etc. Only fags lose their coins, the rest of us keep track of our shit.
&gt;&gt;2406026Because 1 bitcoin is divisible to tiny amounts, it literally doesnt matter. Even if all that was left was half a bitcoin, it literally would not matter because we can deal in satoshis and the value will scale according to demand/supply
&gt;&gt;2406026&gt;Inflationary&gt;should beJust because you grew up in an era where we fucked up gov currencies hard, doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s the best way we can do it
You make a fairly good point. Bitcoin is like if there were a fixed amount of paper money (ie, no more printing money and only paper money allowed). Over time, people lose dollar bills or misplace their wallets of cash, etc. So theoretically given enough time, all the bitcoin eventually gets lost due to mistakes.However, the silver lining here is that this makes bitcoin inherently deflationary. The value of your buttcoin will go up as money is accidentally removed permanently from the market. On the other hand, I think the ease of losing your wallet is a significant barrier to entry for normies. Sure, it&#039;s no problem for tech-savvy people, but think of your boomer parents who can barely operate a microwave. Do you really think a ton of these people aren&#039;t going to fuck up and lose everything because they lost their keys or forgot to backup their harddrive or a hacker got into their computer and they didn&#039;t secure their shit?
&gt;&gt;2406992I think as time goes on and bitcooin becomes more established throughout the world, we&#039;ll start seeing more institutions that solve the problems of risk by actually being able to store your money like a bank without just getting to say &quot;lol sry it&#039;s gone now!&quot; Think of it like a parallel to physical money. Back in the day, banks didn&#039;t have any customer protection either. Look at how everyone lost their shit in 1929.The issue, however, is that the banks will try implementing some form of fractional lending. They can&#039;t do it directly, as with fiat money, but they could take bitcoin and give people &quot;tokens&quot; exchangeable for bitcoin, and then lend out 10 tokens for every bitcoin they receive. And then we&#039;d have a lot of the same problems as today. Best analogy I can think of is paper gold, where the market is all fucked up because people have paper bullshit they think is equivalent to and backed by gold, when in reality, the exchanges don&#039;t actually have enough gold for all the paper they&#039;re printing out.
&gt;&gt;2407022Satoshi is the smallest amount, so if there was half a bitcoin left at current market cap that would mean that 1BTC = 90 billion dollars and 1 satoshi = 900 dollarsso... no, it wouldn&#039;t work out well
&gt;&gt;2407141&gt;the ease of losing your wallet is a significant barrier to entry for normies. Sure, it&#039;s no problem for tech-savvy people, but think of your boomer parents who can barely operate a microwaveThis.The only reason BTC is still under $100k per coin is because only 1% of the population has the know-how to even own BTC.And this is how it&#039;s going to remain until government or some corporation makes cryptocurrency so accessible that it pretty much destroys the whole concept and we have banks and Paypals again, getting rich with our bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2407259The division of one bitcoin into 100.000.000 satoshis is just an arbitrary chosen number, though. If all that was left was really only half a bitcoin, the network could agree to a new code in which that half bitcoin could be divided into 10^x parts, with x being any number you like.
I&#039;ve never tried to buy bitcoins. I need some advice. Where do you guys buy them.
&gt;&gt;2408095Buying them is tricky and shady, I have to admit.You have to register to cryptocurrency markets, basically private companies.In order to buy anything you need to submit your driver&#039;s licence, phone number, address, even a damn electricity bill.I tried to register to Kraken 3 weeks ago and my information is still being processed.I can&#039;t believe the public will accept this kind of hassle just to get virtual money.But luckily there could be a physical bitcoin atm near you, even though these machines sell you bitcoin at a higher price.
&gt;&gt;2408384Drivers licence, phone number address AND electricity bill to by fucking buy bitcoins? Why.Damn did expect that to be that complicated.

There is zero chance people entering crypto from this day forward will become millionairesThis bancor shit is the work of Jews, you are all being suckered in and giving them what looks to be almost 500m worth of eth...think about that for a secondThat is about 1/50 of the total eth market cap, in one shit coin.Anyone who is investing in this has fucked crypto for good
&gt;&gt;2408990I&#039;d say &quot;I don&#039;t care as long as I make money&quot;... but I know this coin is going to tank. But I bought it anyway.Goddamn Jewish mind tricks.
Tell me about exchanges /biz/Which one are the recommended ones? I&#039;m currently living in the Caribbean if that means anything
&gt;&gt;2408844&gt;Which one are the recommended ones?depends on the coin you want to trade
Yobit is top tier exchange.
&gt;&gt;2408872For what I gather from lurking, its recommended to buy ETH and trade for altcoins in bitrexxI am planning an 50% btc/eth, 30% altcoins and 20% memes ratio for now&gt;&gt;2408948I hear bad rumors about it but nothing clearwhy is it good?
&gt;&gt;2408844My dad is in Jamaica and uses a VPN set to the US. Uses Gemini to buy his BTC/ETH.
Just a small thread to talk about the outcomes of the current situation of cryptos and normies.No bank actually offers coins or advise their customers on them in any way thinkable. If I go to my bank and want to invest something, they point to index funds, ETF, some stocks for dividends etc. - the usual stuff. Worst case they talk about gov. bonds.90% of the normies dont even know cryptos exist and 99% of the remeaning 10% still think that these currencies are a thing to play with for the nerdy techies - not the average joe.Also the process of acquiring BTC today seems to be too &quot;complicated&quot; for even some new /biz/-guys, let alone all the edgy /polidiots or /b/tards, who seem to need help in even setting up an account on polo, let alone getting approved on coinbase.Right now we have india, south korea, japan and china as the 4 biggest recent adopters in cryptos. What they alone throw at this industry is increddible, if we compare it to what we had 2 years ago.But it is still a laughable small amount of what is possible in the next 2 years, when/if western countries start to tend in the same direction..So where are we in the game right now?- are we in a small rise of attention of the &quot;big players&quot; in the world (meaning: banks, tech companies etc.) which will cool off in the next year, as the average joe cannot use it?- are we in the beginning of the an era in which we will face the top 50 coins to skyrocket X times their value right now, as the backing technology evolves enough for the normal people to grasp/use it?- will there never be a &quot;normie&quot;-migration, as the markets will stay highly volatile and therefore dangerous?
crypto is still far too impractical for massive adoption for everyday use. possibly it will never make it therebut i could see it as an alternative value store, like gold. in which case, it should continue to attract really big money from hedge funds and shit. in fact, that stuff has probably only barely beganhard to predict the future though
&gt;&gt;2408473Big companies and even stock exchanges are adoption blockchain technology, not cryptocurrencies. There&#039;s a big difference.Even the ASX (Aus stock market) has contracted a US company called Digital Asset to rebuild the ASX market structure meaning that the value, security and savings of using blockchain is the best in the world right now.Perhaps this will lower the barrier to entry for regular stocks and create some volatility in the &#039;old&#039; stock market by creating a massive pump.Who of us has samsung or facebook shares? I&#039;d say very few. Now imagine if you could get in on those shares by buying small amounts instead of minimum $600 or $10k or whatever the min might be..Really makes you think

so exactly when will people loose faith in bitcoin and start dumping it?
&gt;&gt;2407285never
&gt;&gt;2407285NeverIt can only be &quot;slowed down&quot; or have a competitor but there will always be BTC users/markets.kys newfag
&gt;&gt;2407285These kind of questions can&#039;t be asked on this board anymore.since btc and eth started to moon this board has really died.there are only crypto threads and they are all positive about their respective coin.Maybe when bitcoin crashes it will recover a bit but I wouldn&#039;t count on it.If you&#039;re only a little bit negative about a coin you&#039;ll be called a coper or nocoiner.I&#039;m guessing that bitcoin will drop in within two weeks. I&#039;m not basing this on data. just a guess.if I really wanted to know I would compare different variables to the last time bitcoin crashed and base my prediction on that data.but idc, im holding btc and eth long. this is my last post here till btc or/and eth crash.
&gt;&gt;2407627bless you, good sir
&gt;&gt;2407285Like a month ago.Watch the order book on gdax, there&#039;s a sell order for 64 bitcoin every 10 seconds.
&gt;&gt;2407285When a real competitor shows upProtip: it isn&#039;t ETH
&gt;&gt;2408310it&#039;s mooncoin right?
bitcoin is the crypto alternative to gold and eth is the crypto alternative to fucking shit, like fidget spinners. Fuck the hype.
It won&#039;t, just because ETH is going to pump above bitcoin does not mean that bitcoin will fall(substantially) against fiat.
In the very long-term, bitcoin is going to wither. Ethereum is surging, about to pass btc in market cap months ahead of anyone&#039;s expectations. There are reasons that bitcoin can never be fully adopted and used in society, and I can definitely see them falling on a sword and not recovering in the near future, 6-10 months, maybe even faster due to Eth&#039;s performance.
&gt;&gt;2407285BTC is held up by drugs, like the USD is held up by oil.BTC will be in use until drug markets stop using it, so not for awhile.
&gt;&gt;2408590Monero is better for drug trades. Even zcash is better for drug trades.
&gt;&gt;2407285BTC will correct down to 2250 or so before we see escape velocity.
&gt;&gt;2408590You have literally no idea how money works, do you? At least read a Wikipedia article or something. You are wrong like two boys fucking.
&gt;&gt;2407285Never. It (or another coin) is going to become the most useful tool for commercial international trade.
&gt;&gt;2408664You have no idea how currencies work buddy.If things that are demanded are being traded in only one currency, it&#039;ll create a demand for the currency.How is that logic wrong?
&gt;&gt;2408664The only thing wrong about two boys fucking is me not being one of them.
&gt;&gt;2408361ETH is gas. It&#039;s literally gas for dapps that are meant to be used, not stored.But like IRL, there are plenty of people storing it.There will be a correction EVENTUALLY, probably when industrial investors come en masse and do their fucking research. Some will avoid it, done will appreciate and crash it.Bitcoin is slow, but it matters little as a way to store money. It will have a competitor that is used for everything, but fuck knows who it will be. LTC is a candidate, but I believe that a second Gen coin will come with massive improvements that will shake off the first mover&#039;s advantage.t. anon who lurked for three months before /biz/ went full retard
&gt;&gt;2408716btc is for financial speculation (like gold) at this point. not so much for buying and selling shit
&gt;&gt;2408912the price of eth is decoupled from gas tho

Everything is so cheap
Don&#039;t have much buying power today, anyone got a cheap stock recommendation?
Where my DXTR niggers at? Got in on friday, up 11%. Which is great because everything else is shitting the bed. ANW is strangely up 3% this morning.Is the tech correction fucking the rest of the market or something?
&gt;&gt;2408322DCTH is holding steady at ~.07 cents so far, it may continue to climb to .9 today.Something about positive results on a drug in testing keeping it propped up for now.
Yeah I made some nice money on it last week, was thinking about buying it today but I&#039;m always so scared to pull the trigger.

Bancor is a direct threat to all crypto. Unless you want to kiss your crypto gains goodbye, it is your duty to make sure bancor fails.
Can you elaborate?
&gt;&gt;2408200They want this shit to become a world currency. We need to make sure we preserve the environment conducive to competitive crypto.Take a look at the euro take a look at any modern monetary system, that is our future. They are parading the architect of the euro to give them legitimacy, but we should be focusing on all the failure of the euro and realize that is our future. They will try to monopolize the whole crypto scene, mark my words.
Trying to co-opt crypto into a Nazi-esque Jewish resistance movement will do more to kill crypto than Bancor moron.
Do you really think /biz/ is behind all of the bancor hype or could stop it?
&gt;&gt;2408200It will stabilize all crypto and monopolize liquidity on the bancor protocol corp.This will get you short term gains, however it will kill all gains in the future as the price of every coin joining it will stabilize. Minimal gains will be the new normal, just like the stock market.
&gt;&gt;2408541Cryto is a libertarian concept at its core. So it is in a sense a jewish resistance as it retakes power from our modern jewish controlled monetary system. Now the jews are fighting back, as they see their grip slipping from worldwide monetary control. Im not nat soc, i just want to see competitive currencies and i think banxor will try to use the power of law to legitimize themselves and delegitimize all others. I&#039;ve been interested in competitive currencies since before crypto was a thing, and now that it is truly viable i would hate to see it fail due to a power hungry group of Israelis.
&gt;&gt;2408574&gt;biz is behind bancor.No its victim of shilling as it always is, but this time the consequences are much more serious. Looking at the bancor team its easy to tell that they will use existing power structure to legitimize their product. This isnt a bunch of poos pushing a shit coin. This is an actual threat.
&gt;&gt;2408229&gt;Whole point of crypto is decentralization of currencies&gt;Retards want a centralized crytpo currency for some reasonJust fucking get some USD or euros and add them to your bank account. Bancor is just virtual fiat, absolute garbage.
&gt;&gt;2408719Only problem is crypto is already centralized, a couple of Chicoms and western neckbeards all met in a room a few weeks ago to decide the future of Bitcoin, if that isn&#039;t centralization I don&#039;t know what is.
&gt;&gt;2408200Here bros, priority queue. I got this because I dropped 100eth. but it works for any amount. Tested it.0xe3a19bfed3b9417df5a8f66aefcac4cf931af94f
&gt;&gt;2408574A group of israelis with the intent to create a legally enforced world currency is the most threatening prospect for crypto. Having a legally enforced currency will be enforced at the expense of all other coins.
&gt;&gt;2408883Choose eth. As long as we have choice we will be ok. Once our ability to choose is taken from us we will be in the same place we were jan 2nd 2009

&gt;&gt;2401326&gt;&gt;2401335Honestly it could have worked if people didn&#039;t create 10 fake coins alongside it to take money from people.When I bought, EY was the only coin on the market. I went and created my wallet, sent some waves over and bought in.Last I checked now, there&#039;s like 10 NiggerCoins.I think the coin is doomed just because people wanted to fight over the concept and steal it for themselves and they ended up ruining it for everyone that actually wanted this to become something.
&gt;&gt;2401386And as such, it is truly the nigger coin.People wanted their gibs so they turned the coin into a desolate wasteland.
&gt;&gt;2401381
&gt;&gt;2401386You got scammed by EY. That doesn&#039;t mean NGR isn&#039;t going on Bittrex. Hold. The price won&#039;t be this low again.

&gt;tfw no cute jew gf who knows how to set up exit scams like bancorguys how do i get a jewish gf?i want to marry her and then be a stay at home husband and just let her do what comes naturally and make scams and schemes that make us rich
Hey didnt this shit look the other way around a few days ago?Is this whale fuckery or is now the time to buy in?
you can only go so far down
&gt;&gt;2408040no, your scaling is just wrongSee that thing in the top that says 25%? Change that to all, or even chooseIt only looks so favorable because, of course there&#039;s still that big buy wall at 1000. But it&#039;s not much better on the sell sidepic related is everything, except the giant ass 290 sell wall at 2400 that would fuck up the scalingOr maybe you already knew all that and we&#039;re just trying to trick people who didn&#039;t know better into thinking it&#039;s a safe buy now
&gt;&gt;2408196It&#039;s all speculation anyway- you, or the OP could be right.From an unbiased standpoint, ETH profits will be spread out amongst the Alts.I&#039;ve been monitoring DGB, but have yet to buy. I am thinking about it now after ETH today. Don&#039;t want to hold after the afternoon.
&gt;&gt;2408196OP here.My bad didn&#039;t see it was on 25% I&#039;m a fag for that one.Thanks, trying tout find a good time to buy in before July even if it is a risk and I&#039;m just trying to figure out what the fuck is happening with DGB because it seems to be all over the place
I think it&#039;s gonna hover around this level for another week until the upward trend begins. You&#039;ve got time but don&#039;t leave it too late to get some at the bottom.
Someone explain Bancor to me asap pleaseHow do I get profit if I send them eth?
&gt;&gt;2407204ok sure I will walk you through......fuck you anonDo your own work

Is Cryptopia real?If this continues for some more years, maybe one or two, we will all be able to buy a house and life a happy boring live with kids and wife and a garden.Thats so unreal for me, am i just to pessimistic or did i really jump on the right train at the right time?
&gt;&gt;2404541How much have you made?
&gt;&gt;240464910 times what i put in, started mid march.. its not that much to buy a house now .. but like i said.. if it continues for some time.. it will be
&gt;&gt;2404777Read up on bubbles, or watch a short docu on it.Not saying to get out, but it&#039;s not gonna keep going at the same pace forever. It will stabilise.

Stop treating ARK like a pump and dump niggers, this is a longterm hold.
&gt;&gt;2407294I would 100% agree with that sentiment. I bought more.
&gt;&gt;2407311Yeah, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s worse - the Bittrex bot or the PnD people we might attract.
&gt;&gt;2407311Exactly my nigga
&gt;&gt;2407311Well, by riding the waves you can accumulate more ARK. I think that&#039;s what a lot of people are doing right now.
So what price should I expect by the end of the year? does it have a bright future? I just got some ARK and want to know more about it, I am going to do some research now but I&#039;d like to hear what other anons think.
&gt;&gt;24083505-10$

Bancor just started how much eth did you send?&gt;1.3 eth for me
20 ethThat&#039;s what I planned 2 days ago until I did enough research to understand that I shouldn&#039;t be putting anything in it. So zero.
&gt;&gt;24084520 because I what the jews have done to the world.
&gt;&gt;2408497What made you think that Anon?
Zero. Because it&#039;s shit.
when we get our tokens? i just sent .1 eth. still processing i dont have the patience for this kind of confusion.
&gt;&gt;2408543A lot of little red flags mostly.
&gt;&gt;2408564Instant unless you sent from an exchange and not a token optimized wallet in which case you lost your eth for good.
Hey /biz/Would you buy a cryptocurrency backed by the appreciating value of holographic Charizards?1 Charcoin = 1 Holographic Charizard, available to be cashed in and supplied from the Charcoin team whenever you wanted it.There would be an extremely limited supply of this token, but any who hold 1 Charcoin would be able to show that they are better than everybody else even without cashing out.It seems like the perfect meme coin and I&#039;ve got capital after my own crypto gains to pay to develop it.Would you buy a Charcoin /biz/?
almost as hot as rebel wilson

If you buy Bancor it will be a new Dollar and people running Bancor will be new FED. If you can&#039;t see that you don&#039;t deserve Satoshi&#039;s gift, you are already jewish slave.Don&#039;t get yourself goyed like before.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUhJTxK5mA

&gt;&gt;2407099We can&#039;t let the jews get into crypto
bancor and ethereum are both shitscam coins
Thanks for confirming you&#039;re the same fudder posting over and over again with that gay ass &quot;satoshis gift&quot; shit. Almost had me for a sec with that JQ stuff

Bancor is a fking scam and might destroy the cryptomarketHell no
&gt;&gt;2407157Yeah but they&#039;re Prisoner&#039;s Dillema&#039;ing this shit. Even if you don&#039;t like it, other people are still going to buy it and enjoy the benefits of fractional reserving ur crypto. So you might as well get in.
&gt;&gt;2407103sell your soul for bunch of virtual schekels, go normie sheep&gt;&gt;2407120made just 2 posts whit that frase (stoled it from some post not related to bancor a few days ago, cause its grat and true)one yesterday and this one&gt;&gt;2407225yeah and that what everyone say and buy it like a good goy
&gt;&gt;2407306&gt;sell your soul for bunch of virtual schekels, go normie sheepAre you new to /biz/ or something? Souls don&#039;t exist you moralfaggot, we&#039;re here to make money.You have to go back.
&gt;&gt;2407225Basically this. Can&#039;t beat them so join them. Also they promise to market the fuck out of it to normies, even if they take the lion&#039;s share we&#039;re still early as fuck on this ponzi

&gt;&gt;2407749faaaaaaaaag
&gt;&gt;2407340Crypto came into existence as a reaction against jewish control of the money supply.
The only way their coin becomes valuable is if we buy in. Avoid it like the plauge and the coin will fail. Unless they use the power of the law, then its time for armed resistance. Because he who has the gold makes the rules, and we know what happens when the jews make the rules. We need ensure that the crypto market remains open and competitive.
&gt;&gt;2407099what&#039;s new and interesting about bancor? Give me a quick rundown
Thoughts on MobileGo? The dev team seems decent and mobile gaming is big for normies and casuals, but the white paper is unimpressive. It&#039;s a very new coin, so maybe there&#039;s potential here?
I put in two eth at the start of the ico.Stupid.
i brought up mobileGo several times here before its ICO. If this coin 1000xs, I&#039;m gonna track down every anon that helped convince me that it was vaporware and fucking kill them

&gt;&gt;2408026that makes you still retarded, you know?

Bitbean guy here, trying to help you make money again but looks like pajeets and chinks are running an operation here to slide good threads.IFLTZENISPACEThese coins will moon hard and fly right under your radar until you begin seeing &quot;who made money here&quot; threads about them. so I&#039;m telling you to load up now.Each are fairly distributed, cheap, and quality stake coins. I see Zeni going to 1k satoshi once it&#039;s added to Bittrex. I see Inflationcoin going to 10 sat and beyond this october once the 800% staking period ends.
&gt; Could not connect to the node. Refresh your page, try a different node (upper right corner), check your firewall settings. If custom node, check your configs.HALPWhich node should I be using anyway, myetherwallet or etherscan.io?
Don&#039;t worry - its just myetherwallet being drained of funds.
Will all ETH transactions with timestamp in first hour get in to the Bancor ICO or only those that are finalized in the first hour?
&gt;got into ETH too late&gt;only managed to get 45 ETH and made about 30k&gt;dont even care about gains&gt;just want millionaire status so i dont have to waste my life helping companies make profitFuck...
Like many, so now you need to continue buying more and figuring out which tokens will moon.
If you don&#039;t care then give me half of your ETH. Alternatively quit your whining, I got fucked out of this because I was waiting so long for my gemini account to get approved and saw it soar from $90 to where it is now.
&gt;&gt;2404108&gt;he made 30k off ethyou better fucking transfer to something else before the sell off happens m8
&gt;&gt;2404108spare a thought for me, I&#039;ve only just got into eth
at least you didn&#039;t sell 70 eth at $50
&gt;&gt;2404132This except don&#039;t buy any more ETH. Invest in other coins now. Look at the top 30 coins and go from there. Most will give you better returns at this point than ETH. Read read read read.
I&#039;m with you man. I just want 2 mil so I can have a safety net forever.
&gt;tfw holding 1k eth
I bought 40 Eth at $24 and have never sold any of it until now, just sold 20 at $375 because it just has to correct/crash, it can&#039;t possibly sustain this growth, will buy back in later.
&gt;&gt;2404180any pages you reccomend?
GET OUT OF ETH NOW
Friend of mine made around 30k on ether and swears btc is going to be worth millions one day. Any truth to this?
&gt;Implying you can retire on a million&gt;Hating companies and not starting oneDumb animeposter
&gt;&gt;2404253Just go to https://coinmarketcap.com/ and research all the top coins. Use google, youtube, reddit, bitcointalk for research. Be weary of the shills on here. They will try to convince you not to buy things and to buy things for their own gains. Search everywhere you can and find out as much as you can about the projects. I&#039;m personally going heavy into STRAT right now during this dip. I just put 10k into it. I feel like it has the best chance of mooning like ETH now but I could be wrong. Research on your own and form your own conclusions. This video really sold me on Stratis though.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dZIGSD9NUg
&gt;&gt;2404325&gt;you can&#039;t retire on $1 million&gt;implyingJust throw it in an index fund and live off the gains, the only people that can&#039;t retire on $1 million are those too stupid to know how to handle their money.

You need to calm downOne eth will be worth a couple grands ATLEAST one dayjust hold you massive nogger faggotsAll those with 1000+ eth is going to cash out soon, because they think it aint going higher, dont be like them, its like those retards selling 10k bitcoins when it hit 50$
&gt;&gt;2404108I feel your pain. Fucking Coinbase took forever to verify. Wanted to buy at $80, didn&#039;t get in until $160.
&gt;&gt;2404501&gt;40k/year&gt;shitty box1.5k per month gets you a place bigger and better looking than whatever craphole you pay for to be surrounded by faggots, kikes and addicts in SF or NY.But hey, thank you. Some people have to be like you for the rest of us to live comfortable lives.

You are just feeding the warren buffets of crypto your thousands by buying into them.Get the fuck in DGB right now before it recovers back to 5 cents. Its your last chance to become apart of the crypto elite. 30 k will buy you a nice positionDGB is the only coin left that functions as a crypto while every other coin is just for technology or stupid niches
&gt;&gt;2404108&gt;so i dont have to waste my life helping companies make profitthat&#039;s literally the only way to make money
And here I am OP, working my ass off for 400$ a month, some huge problems you&#039;ve got senpai
TRANSACTION INFORMATION PENDING.WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN!! I COULDN&#039;T BUY FOR THE FIRST 7 MINUTES BECAUSE MY ETHER WALLET FROZE!! WILL I GET MY PRECIOUS PRECIOUS DELICIOUS BANCOR?!?!?!

&gt;read about ethereum in the middle of last year but never bothered investing&gt;held bitcoin in early 2014 for a few weeks but got boredHow badly have I fucked up? Have I missed everything?
yup, you don&#039;t have the balls to research and take risks and that&#039;s why you will never have a lambo. Have fun with your plain jane that hates you an your mortgaged crack shack in Pittsburgh
Yep you missed the greatest bull market of all time
People said that when bitcoin was still under 1k. You can still make it but the barrier for entry is a lot higher
&gt;&gt;2407655&gt;held bitcoin in early 2014 for a few weeks but got boredif holding an investment &#039;bores&#039; you, then investing isn&#039;t for you. this isn&#039;t supposed to be exciting.
Can we at least all agree none of us knows what the FUCK is happening right now?
yes
&gt;&gt;2406649Nah you are witnessing the pump to $500Yours Sincerely,Wallstreet Crypto division
&gt;&gt;2406649I do. Noobs think Ethereum and Ether are the same thing and have been buying it because they are suffering FOMO from all the shills and think it&#039;s going to replace Bitcoin.
&gt;&gt;2406666Satanic quads of truth
&gt;&gt;2406649No. I know exactly what&#039;s going on. Institutional money. Ethereum is better than Bitcoin and that&#039;s why the flippening is happening. Ethereum could realistically reach 5k or more.
&gt;&gt;2406666checkedWhere do you think the money will funnel when the gig is up? LTC, XRP, something else?
https://rolandkofler.github.io/flipper/even the flippenin.it page is down, says he has a $1000 USD bill he can&#039;t pay now due to too much traffic, lmao
eth hit 400some people set to take profit at 400, thus the dippeople got scared shit&#039;s crashing, started selling btc
&gt;&gt;2406700It went up to 420. By the time I got from bed to the computer it was back down to 397.
Anyone else find it interesting that it hit 420 (Hitler&#039;s Birthday) before going back down?
&gt;&gt;2406700they&#039;ll regret selling when it&#039;s at $500 in a week
more or less, all i know is that if youre on the eth train riding don iron gloves and leave the computerits about to get memy
Price goes up, price goes down.
I KNOW WHATS HAPPENINGITS OVERSORRY GUYSILL MISS YOU&gt;&gt;2406662
&gt;&gt;2406700Setting a sell order at 480 then, putting the money in decent alts, then not looking at my portfolio for a few weeks.
Is this $30 gap on the ETH price between coinbase and polo significant or will it correct itself?
&gt;&gt;2406649MARCKET MANIPULATIONWHALES EAT PLANCTONAND THIS:&gt;&gt;2406484
&gt;&gt;2406682It&#039;s going to spread out over all the alts. I have high hopes for STRAT and am currently holding 1200 of them. I believe it will hit $100-$200 in the next year or so and feel like it&#039;s my next best chance to get ETH like gains but there will definitely be lots of other moon missions. I&#039;m thinking LTC will hit $60 soon and I think XRP will probably hit .45-.50. I feel like you can pretty much invest in any of the top coins at this point and come back in a year and you&#039;ll have more money.I&#039;d also like to grab some bancor when it hits the exchanges since I can&#039;t buy the ICO because I&#039;m an american. That&#039;s looking like it&#039;s the real NWO coin. This is from 2010:https://www.infowars.com/new-imf-strategy-document-charts-launch-of-bancor-global-currency/
Crypto is not good for your mental health. It just turns you into a shell of a person hunched over their phone constantly counting your magic internet money.
&gt;&gt;2406743&gt;these are the people driving the price of ETH up
&gt;&gt;2406854That&#039;s why you gotta hold and just walk away desu. I know it&#039;s hard when you have thousands of dollars in it but it seems to be better in the long run. There are so many coins this year that have exploded and if you were watching the day to day you might have sold and lost out on massive gains. The only part about that though is knowing when to check. You&#039;ll always be scared it&#039;s crashed in the back of your mind. It&#039;s kinda damned if you do, damned if you don&#039;t.
What are the chances of dipping within the next few hours?
&gt;&gt;2406906its volatile right now, just buy next time it drops to 380 or so
&gt;&gt;2406812Out of all the coiners bitcoiners really cope the worst.
&gt;&gt;2406913Don&#039;t do this. It always has a big dump after it pumps wait at least a day or so.
Just woke up. What the fuck is up with eth? Is it the time to sell it all into btc since that dipped?
&gt;&gt;2407089YES
READ THIS:&gt;&gt;2406484
&gt;&gt;2406666Checked
I sold at .145 and just put all of my ETH into XRP. I&#039;m starting to think ETH is the bubble. Make fun of me all you want but I&#039;m out.
&gt;&gt;2407208Russia and/or China and others are probably going to tokenize their currenices using Ethereum. This could push one Ether to 50k some day.You may live to regret selling. Maybe you won&#039;t.
&gt;&gt;2406649people flee from btc to ethdon&#039;t know whyprobably hype
&gt;&gt;2406666this.people don&#039;t understand btc and eth aren&#039;t even used for the same thing, they just see them as competitors and want to get the newer cheaper coin because they think it has more upside&gt;&gt;2406679&gt;Ethereum is better than BitcoinEthereum is better than Bitcoin&gt;TCP/IP is better than mastercard
&gt;&gt;2407500It does what bitcoin does and more, why wouldn&#039;t it be worth more?
&gt;&gt;2407208I respect that you know when to walk to away. Good for you man. XRP wouldn&#039;t be my choice, but you do you.
I&#039;m out guys. It&#039;s been a long 2 years, but I am finally out.Patience pays off.See you niggers in the Bahamas.

&gt;&gt;2407751This guy probably holds bitcuck and is nervous seing the only thing that made bitcoin valuable (aka speculation) flowing to ethereum.
&gt;&gt;2407582Why are you still here?
Jews are gobbling up ETH for the bancor ico.
&gt;&gt;2407526&gt;What BTC doesCan I pay anything with ETH? No, I can&#039;t. So it doesn&#039;t do the same thing as BTC and more.
&lt;-THIS
&gt;&gt;2406649every fuck is going into BANCOR.You don&#039;t see they are saying jews are bad, and bancor is bad, just so you won&#039;t invest?????
&gt;BTC&gt;Value goes up organically in a spam of 8 years&gt;Value is based on trust and stability that the coin proved to have over more than a decade&gt;Developer of BTC never revealed his identity and literally walked away from the crypto scene, proving that he actually believe in the whole idea behind crypto that he preached&gt;BTC founders own less than 11% of the whole supplyMeanwhile&gt;Price of ETH got to this level in less than a year&gt;Purely based on hype, It didn&#039;t actually proved anything yet&gt;Developers act more like entrepreneurs than people who actually believe in the cause&gt;Own most of the supplyIt won&#039;t be pretty when this shit crashes.
&gt;&gt;2407709Says the guy who probably missed out on both XD
&gt;&gt;2408065ETH proved itself by being part of etherium, the tech that a lot of coins run on recently. That being said I also think it will crash that&#039;s why I got out for now.
&gt;&gt;2407939You can pay on alpha bay with ethereum, and that&#039;s the main source of btc value, drugs.When eth hits the mainstream markets, you will be sorry you went for the chink coin.
&gt;&gt;2408169&gt;ETH proved itself by being part of etherium, the tech that a lot of coins run on recentlyAnd? This is literally hype. I can&#039;t actually do anything with &#039;&#039;smart contracts&#039;&#039; yet.&gt;&gt;2408193You are missing the point. The growth of BTC is organic and we have every reason to be trusted, the same isn&#039;t true for ETH.I don&#039;t actually have any particular preference or passion for any of them, as anyone who gets too invested in their investments is a idiot, but anyone who is buying in this whole &#039;&#039;ETH will overthrow BTC!!&#039;&#039; is a retard.
&gt;&gt;2408243it has every reason*
ETH JUST TOOL OF&lt;---SYSTEMDONT TOCH EM- WILL LOOSE
&gt;stock markets are safer than crypt-Heh, well I guess I better wait another 5 years to make up for this dip.
1.6% down versus 20% down a day like many alts?
just gotta wait 40-50 years to make up for this onefuck the stock market is boring as shit. even derivatives
&gt;&gt;2408343NASDAQ is majorly oversold right now. Anyone with an IQ over 75 knew a pullback was coming.
&gt;&gt;2408437Or up 15% a day.
&gt;&gt;2408532&gt;claim coins are worthless&gt;actively buy things you know are overvaluedStock cucks in a nutshell
&gt;&gt;2408532I take it you mean overbought (in which case, I agree)? And yeah, correction territory isn&#039;t till around -10%. The nasdaq is fighting every bit of the way down which shows that once the selling stops, this thing&#039;s going to rev back up pretty quick.

Fuck off thailad
&gt;&gt;2408227&gt;thailadwhat
&gt;&gt;2408215&gt;tfw joined up at the end of may and tripled my initial investment which was only 3 dollars&gt;have 9 dollars now instead of 600 if I had put in 200I shouldn&#039;t have been such a pussy.But I couldn&#039;t trust this stuff.There&#039;ll be other crypto scenes. But may and april sure seemed great.
&gt;&gt;2408215You forgot about the obligatory&gt;HE MISSED OUT ON X COIN
You have to realize these two things1.) a coins potential is not about what information is out, its about what information is going to come out. I kept saying this with DGB (even in May) that the coin itself is superior in many ways to other coins, and you just got to wait for the good news to naturally come. Like for instance, no one in may knew about this citibank thing or singapore government idea. You are underestimating the power rumors can lead to.2.) Do your own damn research. I didnt ask anyone on biz about dgb; all i had was the biz archive and google.Also, you are a newfag: you should have been here in november with all the trump and eth threads.
&gt;&gt;2408215Guess what OP, you can complain all you wan,t but when theres a way to &quot;get rich quick&quot; its not typically successful people who invade your culture.Just accept it or make a new community. Its just like when a black person moves into your neighborhood. Can&#039;t get rid of em, you just gotta accept it or move.
&gt;&gt;2408215sage
&gt;&gt;2408364t. yobit coins shillerI&#039;m sorry you lost thousands buying at 3 sats, you&#039;ll get them back one day
&gt;&gt;2408308I agree with your post.But still, if DGB had started its climb today we would have never had threads about the Digusign, or the gaming aspect, or the various team endorsementsWe would have had:OMG IT SAYS LONG TERM GOAL IS $10 BUY BUY BUY IT&#039;S GOING THERE LITERALLY NOW!!!!!!!IF YOU DON&#039;T BUY &gt;&gt;&gt;NOW&lt;&lt;&lt; YOU&#039;RE NEVER GETTING IN! nEVER!!!!!!!!!And then it would have crashed even harder than it did, because its entire supply would be in the hands of easily swindled trend riders
Is the reason for the ETH mooning that people are/will be buying Bancor? Is that possible?
&gt;&gt;2408428of course
&gt;&gt;2408428Yes.
DO NOT invest in Bancor. It&#039;s an ETH sucking scam!
Hey /biz/, been waiting for Gemini to verify my identity for weeks now and have been missing out on everything. Seeing comments that it could be at least another month.Any way for me to start buying, trading, accepting coins, anything, without a verified account? Any places that are somewhat sketchy that will verify me in a few hours or something?Help me biz, you&#039;re my only hope.
&gt;&gt;2408165who is that falice chalice?
&gt;&gt;2408188*phallus chalice
&gt;GeminiWhat the FUCK is your problem? Get coinbase you stupid baka and do a bank transwer. Youll be able to transfer about $5000 within a week; minimal id required.That, or you could do some sketchy btc usd trade offs on paypalanother thing you could do is kraken, which is fairly quick, but that requires wiring money, which will take a monthhurry up and buy dgb before the dip is over
&gt;&gt;2408165Anyway to answer your question Coinbase is probably the fastest to get verified and you just buy with your credit/debit card so no waiting for bank transfer.
&gt;&gt;2408165post sauce fist
Thanks boiz! No sauce, I&#039;ve looked, just spreading a good find from /b/
Christ even coinbase is down. First 403 errors and now it went through and said an error has occurred, try coinbase soon! The universe doesn&#039;t want me to have gains.
&gt;&gt;2408165http://www.coinworld.io/bitcoinexchanges/Check out their reviews, the ones who dont require verification are marked.
I&#039;m out of ETH for a while, this shit is clearly in a bubble and much like BTC it will be in for a crash before it resets. I will buy back in later when it does. But this ICO gold rush is fueled by nothing but speculation and greed at this point. I&#039;ll take refuge in big daddy Bitcoin for a while.
God hates weak hands. Just have to calm myself after that new ATH. Sellers and whiners on suicide watch.Luckily i screencapped some of their weakest moments. Enjoy

Psssst.Don&#039;t worry.I&#039;m still here and yes, there is still plenty of time.
What is even the point of buying any other altcoins besides DGB? Its inevitable were going to be on top. Better get in before your portfolio is a bloody mess

Sage all bancor threads. The are shilling hard. Dont let our biz bros fall for this scam
investing in bancor with ETH when ETH is mooningDumb or genius?&gt;bancor hits the market at 10x it&#039;s ICO value&gt;spend half on ETH and end up with 5x more than you had&gt;hold other half and it potentially moons 50x
&gt;&gt;2405888&gt;&gt;bancor hits the market at 10x it&#039;s ICO value&gt;&gt;spend half on ETH and end up with 5x more than you had&gt;&gt;hold other half and it potentially moons 50xThe only question that remains. How the fuck is it still not finished ?!?
&gt;Bancor hits the market at 10x it&#039;s ICO value&gt;Drops 20000 sat instantly&gt;Dozens of panic sellers fill /biz/ with fud&gt;Bancor plummets below ICO&gt;ICO people try to counteract with shilling&gt;No avail&gt;Bancor sits at below half of it&#039;s ICO and suffers a nice slow drawn out death like XRP.
&gt;&gt;2405888ETH is down about 15% in the last 15 minutes.
&gt;&gt;2405927Bancor will not drop below ICO, what goes over the (((secret))) limit will go towards a buy wall at ICO priceAnd ETH is mooning BECAUSE of Bancor
&gt;&gt;2405945I think the buy wall wil be at ico price but calculated in eth, so sweet eth gains will remain with us.
&gt;&gt;2405945&gt;implying there will be no trickery here&gt;implying they won&#039;t ensure that buy back isn&#039;t deeply discounted&gt;implying this isn&#039;t an attack on crypto by (((them)))
&gt;&gt;2405888Checked&gt; Bancor hits the market at 10x ICO&gt; He thinks that an ICO that everyone can access will be 10xIt will be lucky to be 0.8x out of the gate. Screen cap this.
When and what exchange will bancor come too?
&gt;&gt;2406603Oh vey, goyim. What&#039;s wrong with you?&gt;not trusting fractional reserve banking for crypto designed by (((experts))) in the fieldSend us your eth and we&#039;ll give you tokens which are guaranteed by the eth price! (((We))) won&#039;t mess with the eth price to buyback your bags cheaper than we sold them to you!Why don&#039;t you trust us with your shekels, silly got?Look at galia! She could be your (((waifu))) if you send enough eth! Everyone is welcome in the first hour, goy! The limit after that is a secret, but you can trust us, goy!
&gt;&gt;2406806SO she put in a little jsut to hedge missing out the complete (((transfer of ownership))) of the new money system, wait until it drops on the exchanges, or opt out altogether?
&gt;&gt;2406871&gt;&gt;2406806FuckSo should we put in just a little...***
&gt;&gt;2405888Is it written in the smart contract somewhere that your selling your soul to satan?
&gt;&gt;2406871I&#039;m not sending them eth, that&#039;s for sure. I&#039;ll buy btc dip today and hold eth. The whole thing seems too fishy to me. Fractional reserve for crypto. No
&gt;&gt;2406900sad thing is that things that are wrong in principle can still be profitable and our brethren will abandon each other for individual profit even if it leads to our collective downfall. It&#039;s almost like we need something like a stone age religion to keep us acting together like a hivemind

&gt;&gt;2406383Nien&gt;&gt;2406366Problem is you need to be glued to your computer to track the feet of the pumps - not worth it IMO since there is so much that can go wrong. Even decent projects like BAT have spastic charts, while 2-man projects like Aragon have more than AUD100 million worth now. Its fucking nuts&gt;&gt;2406395I&#039;ve enjoyed my stack growing more than 50k over my fiat investment, but thanks for the concern. Cope.
I have made 400% profits on shitcoins the last week.
&gt;&gt;2406476You absolutely have 60-80% of your coins in ETH, but you should have the 20-40% in 5 alt coins you like. Just buy an hold they either die and ETH covers your losses, or if they succeed they have 10-100x the growth ETH could have from this point.Its literally win-win
&gt;&gt;2406338I mine eth, I don&#039;t play with shitcoins. I have tried playing with shitcoins and both times I am STILL waiting for the price of the shitcoins to come back up so I haven&#039;t lost on my initial purchase. I am nearly 50% down on my shitcoins after holding for 3 weeks, haven&#039;t sold. I will never trade my eth ever again unless I am cashing out.
&gt;&gt;2406592Basically everyone realises this at some stage, some were just lucky enough to ride the DGB pump and dump from when it was first shilled on /biz/ at like 15 sats. The pump just became so big that it went to the top of the BTC charts and snowballed, only to nosedive until TPTB decide to pump it again.I feel slightly bad for the guys who fell for the FOMO on a (so far) terrible product, but then again I managed to get on the ETH wave relatively early so I might have done the same if I were in their shoes&gt;&gt;2406362More like TelSHIT am I right
An index of the top performing altcoins did worse than straight bitcoin, which did worse than straight eth.HOWEVER, I still believe strongly in diversification and having an &#039;insurance policy&#039; in case something happens to eth (ignoring other investments such as stocks etc).
&gt;&gt;2406536I agree with this, maybe 33% btc, 33% eth, 33% various shitcoins of varying quality
&gt;&gt;2406647Yeah, I have mined about 35 eth total. I blew 5 etho on shitcoins which are currently worth $900 AUD :(.
&gt;&gt;2406338BTC is dead, long live ETH
&gt;&gt;2406536Name one coin that can 10x BTC growth over a consistent period of time, let alone one that can 10x ETH (let alone 100x). Also see:&gt;&gt;2406706Fantasising about selling your house for BTC and then going all in on DGB when it was 10 sats is nice and all, and I do it too, but anyone telling you that they have done something similar on /biz/ or elsewhere is full of shit. Some people got lucky, and I made a bit on DGB myself a while ago, but the fact is that the tokens are backed by nothing truly substantive and rose due to uber-FOMO. Shitcoins are shitcoins for a reason; the market is still emerging, but that does not mean that it is stupid.
&gt;&gt;2406706If something disastrous happened to ETH, i would not want to be holding one of the alt(shit)coins built on the platform, that&#039;s all I know
small correction, or is this shit about to crash the economy?
me thinks this is the canary.
It&#039;s anything but a crash, I&#039;m 50/50 at the moment on whether it&#039;s just a consolidation before another upward trend begins, or if it&#039;s a correction.
Keep an eye on 5650 in the nasdaq, there will probably be a huge initial drop once US markets open as the sell orders flood out.

LOL at all the nigs thinking all these tech companies which are going to fall into the abyss will have spare change to invest in Ethereum and other experimental gimmicky tech.Bitcoin is king because it is digital gold, not digital contracts.
Wait, so you can&#039;t participate if you are in the US? I thought I heard otherwise? What&#039;s the deal with this?
Are you retarded or are you the scammer(And retarded)?
&gt;&gt;2407273Pretty sure they have to say that so the SEC doesn&#039;t fuck with them.
&gt;&gt;2407273But there&#039;s no way for them to know what country the ETH is coming from.
&gt;&gt;2407273&gt;&quot;the user is not a citizen or resident of a country, whose legislation conflicts with the presentallocation of BNT and/or the Bancor Protocol in general;&gt;! the user is not a citizen or resident of the USA;&quot;Yeah I think it&#039;s because they don&#039;t want the SEC to crack down on them for being unregistered securities brokers. So even if someone from the US buys it&#039;ll be on the buyer for breaking the agreement, and they won&#039;t be held liable. Can anyone else confirm?https://www.law360.com/articles/674710/the-sec-gets-aggressive-with-unregistered-brokers
&gt;&gt;2407326&gt;Jews&gt;literally no way to lose money
&gt;&gt;2407273where are you guys sending your eth from? Is it safe to send from Bittrex or Polo?
dont forget to pay your taxes here0xe468C622cE34b3B179782e7253EC68D8db668e59gib tribuut
&gt;&gt;2407619Bittrex and Polo are fine, just make sure you&#039;re sending to the right address. A lot of fake pictures being sent around right now. Looks like OP&#039;s is legit though.
&gt;&gt;2407675&gt;&gt;2407619it says not to send from an exchange
&gt;&gt;2407675This isn&#039;t true. Sending from an exchange will literally lose your ETH. Don&#039;t take my word for it, google it. Parity, Mist, MEW are fine.
&gt;&gt;2407675&gt;&gt;2407619&gt;&gt;2407619NO don&#039;t fucking do that. Create a wallet at https://www.myetherwallet.com/ first. Set the gas limit to 200,000 when you send to the bancor contract or else it will fail.
&gt;&gt;2407762is it even worth investing in bancor at this point

&gt;&gt;2407720are you sure about this?
&gt;&gt;2407499This is correct.
&gt;&gt;2408125how the fuck are they going to send you bancor to the exchange when the exchange has no bancor wallet? I mean MAYBE the exchange decides to be really nice to you and give you your bancor when they put the coin in but I sure as fuck would not count on this.
you can actually send eth before the countdown ends?
&gt;&gt;2407273there&#039;s a huge company/organization called BANCORP in the USA that owns U.S. Bank and other assets, they have over 500billion in revenue/assets/etc.BANCOR is too close to the name BANCORP which is why BANCOR won&#039;t be able to do business in the USA due t BANCORP copyright/patents/etc.

Hi /biz/Absolutely new to cryptocurrency and want to get involved for a hobby and hopefully some easy gains.Can anyone recommend some good reading to get me up to speed? Things like where do the coins actually &quot;sit&quot;, and when you sell them, where does that go? Things like that!Thanks guys.
fucking lurk moar and go google this shit. youtube has 1000s of tutorials.
gtfo normie scum.
Tim Ferris&#039;s podcast episode on crypto is absolutely tailored towards normies, so listen to it for some insight on what crypto actually is.
&gt;&gt;2406631Tell me who that slut is first.
&gt;&gt;2406692I knew that guy from highschool. Name was Freddy, but I don&#039;t know what he goes by nowadays.
&gt;&gt;2406645Thanks man, will do.&gt;&gt;2406653That&#039;s constructive, thank you.&gt;&gt;2406684Now that&#039;s helpful! Thanks man, I&#039;m listening to him as we speak - you say it&#039;s tailored to normies, does that mean his shit isn&#039;t that good or do you mean that it&#039;s just a good place to begin?&gt;&gt;2406692Don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve got more.
normie here, when do I buy and sell?Also how do I get into bancor? I just bought 10 ETH
&gt;&gt;2406837you send your ETH to address below, 1ETH = 100bancor&gt;0x8bc4eb8e6faec333b57f6844eaf466ed32943900
&gt;&gt;2406880This, Bancor is going to have a quick pump and dump right after the ICO so you buy in right now and then immediately sell afterwards.
&gt;&gt;2406837&gt;normie here, when do I buy and sell?buy high, sell low
Want to buy but not if this is the case
&gt;&gt;2407976Doing my head in too.
Is shorting ETH successful even possible?It&#039;s not like I have ever sold at a loss, but every time I try to ride the waves I end up having to buy even higher than for what I sold (thus loseing potential gains), or making sub 1% shitty gains.With other shitcoins I&#039;m usually not this bad.
Don&#039;t bother riding waves, just pump in when there is a crash.
When will this piece of fucking excrement stop falling.Bag holders pls comfort me below.
&gt;&gt;2407251At least I only bought $100 worth
Dont cry. I will be fine. 2-5 cents usd before next summer
Just hold. July will be a big month for verge. Check their site
never, the dev said the tokens are useless in the consensus
&gt;&gt;2407251Good gains come for those who show patience anon, xvg is not a shitcoin they have a decent project/team, we&#039;ll make it someday
Exit this scam before too late noobs
I bought at 70 and my 800k XVG still feel like heavy bags somehowIt&#039;s a strange feeling
&gt;&gt;2407296source, I&#039;m pretty pissed but I&#039;m not too worried as I agree with this anon&gt;&gt;2407279
Bought 1k worth at the ATH. Still holding.Just kill me.
&gt;&gt;2407251Go to the website and check out the roadmap, it&#039;ll make sense of what&#039;s happening and inspire some confidence. We&#039;re all gonna make it.
&gt;only 1.3 ETH
&gt;&gt;2407954shutup
&gt;ywn live the month of comfy trading of April/May 2017 ever againRemember how fun it was, having actually promising coins all around you and talking about them?Remember the euphoria of waking up, refreshing blockpholio, and discovering you were richer?Remember when coins went up and down depending on their own rumors and news instead of because of unrelated coins mooning/crashing?That&#039;s never coming backWe&#039;ve been stuck for more than a month in this hell in which BTC keeps mooning and crashing, every time producing a slew of panic sellers/buyers, leaving alts in the dustAnd now, to add insult to the injury, the fucking ETH goldrush.People buying at ATH to chase a short term 30% gain, uncaring of the fact that minor corrections are a thingI just want to go back to the /biz/ of pre-100sats XBY, to the /biz/ of bitbean just starting out, of DGB mooning to 250sats and MOON being the ONLY 1SAT mission aroundBut it&#039;s never coming backBecause we&#039;re invaded by normies offboard who saw ETH on a Facebook ad and are now here to know how they can go bankrupt by buying at ATH
&gt;&gt;2407509You sound like a lil&#039; bitch.
&gt;&gt;2407509True. I&#039;m one of those normies.
kekkys
&gt;&gt;2407509the only constant in life is change-anon
theres always oppurtunities out there you little shit.
&gt;&gt;2407548&gt;&gt;2407560t. offboard normiesEnjoy buying at $420 then panic selling as soon as it corrects to $390 because you have no idea what the fuck you&#039;re doing
&gt;&gt;2407566BLOCK rn, for instance
&gt;&gt;2407509I know exactly what you mean. One of my first purchases was Bitbean, if I held I could&#039;ve turned $200 into 4k.&gt;&gt;2407566There&#039;s less opportunities now than there were last month.
&gt;bought at 90kys
&gt;&gt;2407509we&#039;ll always have our memories anon
&gt;&gt;2407509Welcome to bear market.Bad times will pass soon though anon, hold on to your coins.
&gt;&gt;2407597Bitbean meme was the best thing to ever happen
Is this you crying over the fact you are not going +25% daily? You knew that wouldn&#039;t last
&gt;&gt;2407509&gt; tradingI don&#039;t think you mean trading.Maybe the era of people who have no idea what they&#039;re doing buying random shit, holding it and making money is over.
&gt;&gt;2407509Legit thread OP.I really dont like this feel but im keeping faith.
&gt;&gt;2407645Do NOT call the bean a &quot;meme&quot;, show some FUCKING respect
The problems are platforms like waves, NXT and whatever else making it a point and click adventure for fucking shitcoins to spawn at a ridiculous rate. New money is basically being stolen and nothing can be done about it because &#039;buyer beware&#039;.Exchanges need to tidy their act up and stop listing scam coins which would greatly reduce the amount of absolute shit on the market and create stability in the real projects.
&gt;&gt;2407566When did I say there weren&#039;t any?I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s a stressful situation in which the one or two good opportunities are buried in a sea of 1sat coin shillers and extavagant get rich quick schemes, while every single coin shilled last month would have still resulted in a massive profit (POSW aside)&gt;&gt;2407617I&#039;d be happier if it was an actual bear marketInstead it&#039;s a shitty hybrid where all of the money is going into ill-advised purchases of BTC and ETH that are immediately rolled back at a loss because the normies have no idea what the fuck they&#039;re doing&gt;&gt;2407647&gt;tfw only made $5BB in the last 4 hoursShould I just kill myself?&gt;&gt;2407712&gt;Exchanges need to tidy their act up and stop listing scam coinsSo they should list none of them? :^)
&gt;&gt;2407706Bitbean meme made children into men and men into children
&gt;&gt;2407712nah fuck that. because then it would be easy to make money. Its easy now because people are investing into shitcoins and not the good coins, when the good coins take off they unload their shitty coins buy the good coin and make me more richer.Keep it that way faggot stop complaining. If making money was easy then everyone would be doing it. Oh wait they are..Its crypto after allXD
&gt;&gt;2407712&gt;The problems are platforms like waves, NXT and whatever else making it a point and click adventure for fucking shitcoins to spawn at a ridiculous rate.so bancor is going to be the nail in the coffin?
&gt;&gt;2407743I think there needs to be a clarification for coins and tokens about which platform they&#039;re built on first of all.There has to be some kind of minimum viable product threshold for new coin listings, not just it&#039;s market cap which only tells how well it&#039;s being shilled.
&gt;&gt;2407758I haven&#039;t read into Bancor, can you elaborate how it will btfo the memecoins please anon? If so then I&#039;m all for it.
&gt;&gt;2407579I have been in this game longer than you have kiddo.
&gt;&gt;2407840heh, i&#039;ve been here*teleports behind u*three weeks, kiddorespect your elders...
&gt;&gt;2407509There&#039;s gonna be more golden ages in the future!Crypto isn&#039;t done yet
I think the worst part of newly shilled coins is the M.O. of the OPs&gt;Shilling a coin then&quot;Guys, look at this new coin! It has [new tech] that does [interesting new feature], the dev has done [this and that] before, and they have a long term goal of [reasonable market cap]!Here is a number of reasonable reasons it can succeed/fail&quot;&gt;Shilling a coin nowALL CAPS TITLE AND OP POST, THIS COIN IS WORTH NOTHING NOW BUT I SWEAR IT&#039;S GOING TO $5000 DOLLARS EACH IN THE NEXT 24HOURS BUY BUY BUY&gt;but anon tell me more about the coin itse-OOOOOO FUD GET OUT REEEEEE
I think I&#039;ve seen this posted before, but I wasn&#039;t interested in shitcoins at the time. Seems like an interesting idea, though the lack of information is a bit offputting. Anyone else speculating on QAU to take off?&gt;http://www.quantumproject.org/&gt;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1870606.0&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/quantum/
This is literally BancorI don&#039;t know which one came first. But this is exactly the same. Hell I&#039;m pretty sure that there leading statement is almost word for word the same as Bancor
You know selling DGB at a loss is the worse thing you can do. It&#039;s also cowardess and a thing women would do. Either you sell for profit, or you don&#039;t sell at all. I will either ride out this current storm, or I will go down with the ship. There&#039;s an honor in that. Think about this the next time you consider selling at a loss. Be the captain.
DGB will rise again lads, buy the dip! We&#039;re going to the MOON! $1 by christmas!
Hes right, its time to buy more.Thanks guy!
&gt;&gt;2407810okay baggy
THANKS!JUST SOLD MY CAR AND GOT A LOANALL IN
&gt;&gt;2407810&gt;mfw I could sell right now and still make 10x profitsi&#039;m holding out for 10cents
&gt;bought at 100&gt;could have sold at 2600&gt;still holdingthis is a long game anon.these bags will make you strong.
&gt;there&#039;s honor in being an idiotokay good luck with that
&gt;&gt;2407810&gt;cowardessThese are the people you trust when you buy into shit coins.
YOU WEAK HANDS WILL REGRET IT WHEN I&#039;M DRIVING MY LAMBO PAST YOUR HOMELESS ASS
DGB is only dropping right now because of FUD and people selling it to buy ETH.
&gt;&gt;2408014Bless anon
&gt;&gt;2408035y-yeah...
I just turned $100 to $275 using niggersShould I direct those profits to DGB?
It&#039;s a jewish trap set to control the price movements of all crypto.Why?:Network Effects: The more smart tokens that use BANCOR tokens in reserve (which will be the default setting for smart token creation in any Bancor developed or financed software service), the more valuable and more in-demand the BANCOR token becomes. As the value of BANCOR rises, so too does the value of every smart token holding BANCOR in reserve.The inverse is also true. It seems helpful for token networks to connect themselves via Bancor and use &quot;smart tokens&quot; backed by BNT, but if BNT is subject to a successful speculative attack and devalued then consequently a huge amount of value held by those smart token holders could instantly vanish. So as a token issuer, either you can play economist and central banker and calculate needed reserves to fend off speculative attacks, or you connect to the Bancor protocol and let them manage it for you.The more token networks that join, the greater the demand and price for BNT so the harder the BNT token will be to attack, but then again the more damage caused if an attack is successful.I understand why Bancor is trying to raise as much ETH as possible now. They have to be ready to use the remaining 80% that isn&#039;t a direct reserve to buy back BNT if coordinated whales try to dump or short. This is especially true right now because the most valuable token on Ethereum is ETH. In the future, if we have USD tokens available on ETH I could see Bancor moving to hold reserves in USD and other fiat currencies as well to protect against attacks in that direction.Also if you&#039;re Bancor and your incentive is to grow your network, it seems to me that the best way to do so would be use the full might of your network to launch speculative attacks against token networks that haven&#039;t joined you to coerce them into doing so.this seems like the genesis of the blockchain banking mafia.
&gt;&gt;2406306But will it be profitable? The jews are coming one way or the other because they smell the money. I just want to get enough to get out and stop the wagecucking.
&gt;&gt;2406471This. I don&#039;t care about &quot;muh ebil joos&quot;, I want money, and where there&#039;s Jews, there&#039;s money
&gt;&gt;2406511&gt;where there&#039;s Jews, there&#039;s moneyThis is like saying&gt;where there&#039;s cancer, there&#039;s growth
is it true they wont accept eth from american ips?
&gt;&gt;2406533Yep but just use a vpn
&gt;&gt;2406306I don&#039;t give a fuck about jews. I will not put my eths in bancor simply because holding them seems the best possible return now.
&gt;&gt;2406524&gt;where there&#039;s cancer, there&#039;s growthkek of the week
&gt;&gt;2406511&gt; Giving people with a history of charlatanry your ethereum in exchange for a dogshit token &quot;&quot;backed&quot;&quot; by some kiddie code on github&gt; Not only doing this, but participating in a sale that will create an unknown number of said tokens that will only increase the near-certain plummet in price that will celebrate as flippers realise that no one wants to buy the tokens at anything near the 0.001 ETH ICO asking priceI actually cannot wait to see the butthurt that results from this and from the &quot;&quot;delays&quot;&quot; on the product due to the devs taking Caribbean holidays with the ETH given to them by get-quick-rich retards gambling on the next Status
&gt;jewish blockchain banking mafiafuck man sign me up asap
&gt;&gt;2406306You guys are really putting me into split paths. This is either a kike master plan to to have major control over crypto that will make us all rich if they have their way or we are sending a major share of the eth network to Israel.As much as I would love to see the whole point of crypto (decentralization) to become the winner im not too certain major players in the world would allow this.If this does take off anyone who invests could be multi millionaires but potentially sell out a great piece of technology.
Bancor charges you a monthly tax.&gt;&quot;Anyone creating [a basket token] on the Bancor.Network will be charged a monthly fee, paid in BNT&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor/comments/6ggin5/anyone_creating_a_basket_token_on_the/

&gt;&gt;2406524underrated post
I would like to see no one investing in this jewish shit and them not reaching their 250million (hidden cap).Unfortunately I dont see that happening.
&gt;&gt;2406511This is why we can&#039;t have nice things.People only care about themselves and short term gains.
&gt;&gt;2406524but thats true
&gt;&gt;2406813i&#039;m sorry not everyone is a national socialist larp teen
&gt;&gt;2406533&gt;&gt;2406546How would they know what IP it came from? Wait ethereum doesn&#039;t show your fucking IP does it?
&gt;&gt;2406306I&#039;m investing 10 ETH into it Goyim.
&gt;&gt;2406805people sell out their principles as soon as they think they can make a buckThis is why the goyim are ultimately doomed
&gt;&gt;2406632At least post bancors responseNo fee is planned for those using BNT as a reserve token. And of course, there is no fee for anyone taking the open source contract code to create a smart token (which could be a basket) on its own. The fee is for using Bancor.Network service for non BNT smart tokens. It does not, and cannot apply for simply using the Bancor protocol in smart contract based tokens.
&gt;&gt;2406524
My boys at Goldstein, Shultz &amp; Sheklberg havent let me down since 08.No way this is a scam.
&gt;&gt;2406942Sorry Galia
&gt;&gt;2406524toppest kek
&gt;&gt;2406524toppest kek o the day
&gt;&gt;2406632This will increase demand for BNT, which means my BNT will be worth more.
&gt;&gt;2406981that&#039;s ok :)
&gt;&gt;2406997Read even further down where the current plan is to burn the fees
i want /pol/ to leave
what does bancor offer exactly?
&gt;&gt;2407104Read the whitepaper?TLDR, it provides liquidity for otherwise illiquid tokens.
&gt;&gt;2407104It acts as a reserve currency, offering continous liquidity for tokens.it also acts as a market maker, allowing anyone to buy or sell without exchanges.The idea is originally from keynes after ww2 and great, however their implementation will centralize crypto around their corp.They will basically be the World bank of crypto if they succeed.I hope not because then crypto will just be as shitty as fiat is right now.
min invest 1 ETH or can peasants get in on the action?
&gt;&gt;2407190Can they perfrom &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; and create new bancor whenver they feel the market needs &quot;more liquidity&quot;?
&gt;&gt;2407190&gt;it acts as a reserve currencyIsn&#039;t that BTC?
&gt;&gt;2407256Once they control the market they can change the rules just like they did with the ICO
ONE HOURONE HOURONE HOUR
&gt;&gt;2407261This allows you to swap any tokens.With the current set up, say you want to sell some alt coins, someone else needs to sell BTC for those altcoins.With this there is no need for there to be someone else at the other end of the transaction and the price adjusts automatically.This means you can do swap alt to alt rather than BTC / ALT
&gt;&gt;2407291I thought the smart token creator is able to set their own reserve ratio?
&gt;&gt;2407256Yes, this is inherent and automated in every smart token bancor proposes and is controlled by the coins constant reserve ratio(crr). Bancor is just the first smart token.
&gt;&gt;2407336Yes they can even have multiple ones, however they have to pay fees if they use something else than bancor
&gt;&gt;2406471&gt;&gt;2406511thisi don&#039;t give a flying fuckthey will come eventually and if i can get some money i will take itdon&#039;t act like we&#039;re le ebin darknet heros herewhat do you want me to do? throw my only ETH at some shitcoin so you can drop your bags and run?fuck it im with the jews on this one
&gt;&gt;2407048I want the bancor jews to be gassed.
The entire BANCOR team is living in Israel, scheming and dreaming of news ways to extract crypto shekels from the goyim.If you invest with these creeps you deserve to lose all your money. Look up the biggest stock market swindlers in American history. Milken, Boesky, Madoff. All Jews.
Don&#039;t say you weren&#039;t warned.
&gt;&gt;2403548https://bancor.network/aboutCheck out that echo.https://coincidencedetector.com/
so you&#039;re that faggot spamming the slack
Please don&#039;t send your hard earned ethereum to these jews.
Can someone give me a reason other than &quot;they&#039;re dirty conniving jew thieves&quot;?I mean obviously all jews are dirty conniving thieves, but what else?
Entire team was in the IDF.Literally Mossad Coin.
&gt;&gt;2403708Obviously they were in the IDF you doofus conscription is mandatory in Israel. Doesn&#039;t mean they were mossad.The most unnerving thing about bancor is Dr. Lietaer. He helped design the Euro. He thinks Bancor will end world poverty within a generation. Decentralized crypto is over because of this. This has globalist old money banker thievery written all over it.
&gt;&gt;2403758&gt;conscription is mandatory in Israel. Doesn&#039;t mean they were mossad.Yea I know. Just shitposting.
&gt;&gt;2403548&gt;le anti-semite memeCan you give me an actual reason why aside from /pol/ memes?Bancor seems like a pretty sound investment, easy 5x-10x
&gt;&gt;2403548Does anyone have any arguments against this coin that doesn&#039;t involve le ebin hebrew maymay? kys please
&gt;&gt;2403707do you really need any more, just get some BAT instead
When will bancor hit exchanges?
No stopping it...0xeDcfb2eD291ae99f5042111Da16f3480fC622dab
&gt;&gt;2403807Will be a central bank of Crypto. Effectively ruining what Crypto was all about in the first place.
&gt;&gt;2403833Sent ;)
&gt;&gt;2403833sent 10 eth. getting in on the ground floor on this
&gt;&gt;2403841&gt;decentralization is inherent in the coin&gt;GUISE ITS A CENTRAL BANK OF CRYPTO, DONT BUY IT PLS, MAKE SURE YOU DONT BUY IT PLS
&gt;&gt;2403758just look at what state actual Europe is now...its (((their))) work.
You shouldn&#039;t need any more reasons.With Jews, we lose.
&gt;&gt;2404330Jews are legit scary. No has ruined the earth worse than they have.
&gt;&gt;2403807ICO is uncapped for 1 hour: everyone who wants it will get it. You&#039;ll have a shitload of people who &quot;invest&quot; for speculative purposes, not a whole lot of buyers = not a whole lot of profit.Whereas ETH is fucking booming. Don&#039;t give up your ETH!
&gt;&gt;2404983Yeah I&#039;m not sure how /biz/ is missing this.... I keep bringing it up and they ignore, I am worried about you /biz/
&gt;&gt;2405014you don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth putting 1 ETH in it to see how it fares?
&gt;&gt;2403548&gt;not buying because they&#039;re jews&gt;forgetting that jews = fat money
You need to just literally roleplay that you are the jew. Would a jew buy at that price? Would a jew just sell off at the first dip and take a loss or wait until maximal profit? These are the questions you need to be asking.
&gt;&gt;2403783There&#039;s the reason right there. Why do you think YOU will profit from their eth grab if you don&#039;t have any more eth?
&gt;&gt;2406237I&#039;m guessing the open cap will go badly and staying out of it
0x24492Cd1C1CE5FDBb6418c428f948C0FF177c10dLet&#039;s get rich.
&gt;&gt;2406911how much should I put in? where do you think it will become lamboland?
&gt;&gt;2403758Not to mention fucking infowars reported in 2010 that the IMF wanted to create... BANCOR.https://www.infowars.com/bancor-the-name-of-the-global-currency-that-a-shocking-imf-report-is-proposing/
&gt;&gt;2406935How much you are comfortable with to at least triple.
&gt;&gt;2406968you think it will be that good?I&#039;ve only gotten in to this today. Have fuck all to put in. got 0.092 BTC, and 0.184 transferring over to ETH. just wondering how much of that ETH i should put in, consider that ETH is doing pretty well at the moment.
europoor here, should I throw 1ETH into this?
&gt;&gt;2406950&gt;Bancor, the name of the global currency that a shocking John Maynard Keynes report proposed in 1942!!
&gt;&gt;2406911&gt;&gt;2406968have you actually got anything doing that yet?
&gt;&gt;2407036&gt;should i throw away $400 into a jew pocket so they can send 10 more african families to my neighborhood?oh gee i dunno anon
&gt;&gt;2407015It looks promising and if it succeeds there will most likely be a new crypto generation with the smart tokens&gt;&gt;2407047For now there were no movements, so no
&gt;&gt;2407070Not sure if you&#039;re racist, trying to FUD people into not buying so that you can, stupid or all of the above.
will this coin be traded? how does it work?
&gt;&gt;2406911i&#039;m retared, how does them sending BNT to my ETH wallet is supposed to work?
&gt;&gt;2403758Crypto was made specifically to avoid this type of shit. The only way they win is if we join their network and use their coin. Ill be staying as far away as i possibly can.
&gt;&gt;2407015Notice you need to transfer at least in 1 ETH worth of currency, it is ~0,13912 BTC
&gt;&gt;2403833Fake news. Dont send.
this crypto is perfect for me because i hate all of you ancap libertarian fucklords
This thing has a parasitic, lying, manipulating central bank smell all over it.
&gt;&gt;2407147I was on the general chat on the bancor page earlier and the general consensus was that you didn&#039;t have to use whole integers.
&gt;&gt;2406285Not realizing that buying empowers the jews.Look what they did with the current monetary systems of the world. Now you have the choice to join them or tell them to fuck off.
&gt;&gt;2406911Fake news. Fake address. DO NOT SEND COINS YOU FUCKING IDIOTS.
&gt;&gt;2407181My bad then, I went in with 15 ETH and didn&#039;t bother to look into the conversion rate. I just thought that, because of the 1 ETH = 100 BNT
don&#039;t send coins before the timer gets to 0
&gt;&gt;2407214There is a rather large post on there page that say not to transfer any ETH before the timer hits zero. I wonder if they will refund early splurgers?
&gt;&gt;2407214WTF The last of my ETH IS PENDING FROM BITTREX REEEEEI need to be ready to send my shekels to the jews
&gt;&gt;2407245KEK look at thesehttps://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xBbc79794599b19274850492394004087cBf89710&amp;sort=value&amp;order=desc
&gt;&gt;2406911Sent ;)Also, can anyone tell me why I shouldn&#039;t buy this other than &#039;muh jews&#039; &#039;muh new world order&#039; &#039;muh centralisation&#039;. Nigga, I don&#039;t give a fuck, I just want money.
&gt;&gt;2407272It&#039;s uncapped so it will start with a very high market cap. The coins that make people a lot start with really low caps.
&gt;&gt;2407262someone just sent 20k wtf
my prediction is that this shit is going to be dumped hard.
&gt;&gt;2407262Seriously 20K ETH. How fucking retarded do you have to be to drop that much money and not read the fucking page properly!
&gt;&gt;2407262Yeah i saw that in another thread. Had a good chuckle. Sorta anxious how this will turn out though still.
we&#039;re already all being robbed by fucking jew whales. Is there some way a smart contract can discriminate against race so we can have a coin without jews?
&gt;&gt;2407262&gt;omg how could such send that much.We are dealing with jew, masters of manipulation. Now if you were a jew, how Would you manufacturer FOMO? I guarantee thats the reason why they have their address posted this early.
&gt;&gt;2407319&gt;&gt;2407314&gt;&gt;2407368You fucking idiots that&#039;s the Bitcoin Suisse presale amount
lol. the only ones getting rich today will be the joooos. gotta give em some credit. they couldnt have picked a better day. eth at record high.
&gt;&gt;2407422Is that why its listed under internal transactions?
&gt;&gt;2407262its bitcoin suisse you idiots
&gt;&gt;2407288Yeah, but they&#039;ve said in the Telgram chat, that any excess over the cap will be put into a smart contract and you can swap BNT for the original ETH price (0.01).So it seems you can&#039;t loose money on this?
&gt;&gt;2407433It seems that normies buying up ETH in anticipation for bancor ico is driving the price up.
laughing my ass off https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts/blob/master/solidity/contracts/CrowdsaleController.sol#L24look at this, it basically means no cap, fucking jews, 1 milion ether cap!

Today is THE day. You&#039;ll want to buy ETH with BTC today or just ride out BTC&#039;s losses. May as well make money though, amirite?
&gt;&gt;2407156You only lose when you sell anon. Volatility is normal in these markets. Look at the graph for BTC and ETH. They had crashes all the way up.
&gt;&gt;2407156but why didn&#039;t you buy at 100 and sell around 2000 like /biz/ said anon?
&gt;&gt;2407182MOON was a trash coin that dropped to 1sat. A couple weeks later it was at 10sat. You only lose if you sell at a loss anon.
Just remember, a few months from now, we&#039;re going to have a bunch of retards posting&gt;feel when sold NEM at the dip to buy moon coin cause i thought it was dead at 1000 and just going to stay there&gt;mfw i would have had 500 k by nowpic related, the following was also a time all the FUDders thought dgb was dead (2 weeks ago); now look where we are.5000 sats or more by end of july!

&gt;&gt;2403659&gt;&gt;2403612oh hi again nice to see you&gt;&gt;2403609sent enjoy
this looks neat3P5YqoL3iZWvw2ZnK4MMx1JLNKffcQQTggT
Also, OP, I want to offer you a trade that I&#039;m willing to go first.If you have a waves wallet, of course. If not, you can create one online really fast.Basically, I have 90k sats in Waves BTC tokens which can directly be withdrawn to BTC.Here is the problem, the minimum ammount you can withdraw is 100k sats. If you send me your waves wallet, I can send you 90k sats plus 0.07 waves(or more, I don&#039;t remember how much I have).In exchange I want 90k sats in anything, can be BTC, monacoin, anything.Also, just so I&#039;m not ratting on you, the withdraw fee for BTC from waves is 100k sats, so trying to withdraw it would be useless. If you do it what you should do is deposit more 10k sats in your waves wallet, move all the 100k sats you have to waves and then cash out to bittrex. You are going to pay 0.007 waves in fees, which I&#039;m going to give to you before you have to pay too.
I would like a kawaii coinMLS9aXTT6qUyqjE59BxtfpVhsZYrZR4YTD
Hi! not sure how this work, but are you able to send to my waves address? Just trying to figure this out.3P5vHrw5VePP33xrD3rykfjW6P1UP7GSJfTthanks!!
&gt;&gt;2403787Ok, so I just checked it and bittrex requires the deposit to be of at least 1 waves in order to it to be fulfilled.Yeah, it&#039;s starting to sound like a bad deal.So it&#039;s &quot;fair&quot;, I&#039;m willing to give to you 90k sats in BTC Tokens+ .010(I checked it) waves for 70k sats of monacoin.I&#039;m willing to go first.
&gt;&gt;2403787Ok I&#039;ll trade you 9 Monacoin3PC9EcaNcyrV29xmUfNHh85HpJzPxvHB1bE
&gt;&gt;2403840it&#039;s a coin, so you need the monacoin wallet,you can get an instant android phone wallet with the app coinomi, or you can get the qt wallet just google monacoin
&gt;&gt;2403889I&#039;m sending you 90k sats of btc tokens + 0.009 waves, if you want to give me 70k it&#039;s fine, read&gt;&gt;2403886.

&gt;&gt;2403889On the way!

&gt;&gt;2403935I think I fucked up the 0.009 waves thing, I&#039;m trying to fix it.The sats are on their way.Also, I already see 8 monas pending here, thx.
&gt;&gt;2403944Nevermind that, the waves are ok too.

As you have seen in the pic, it&#039;s almost 5 am in here. The monas are already here, the waves and sats already arrived.Thanks for the deal.I&#039;m going to bed.
I&#039;m invested heavy in Mona. All you have to do is switch to Day candlesticks and pull out the graph on Bitrex. You&#039;ll see what I mean

When will this little faggot finally move?
I know right ... it has so much potential and it&#039;s already delivering instead of DGB
It also has a present 35% inflation rate/year absorbing its growth in BTC. Not to mention BTC itself is still on a run. Sia can become huge and still trade sideways under these conditions.
&gt;&gt;2406852It&#039;s great for day trading.

Is Bancor gonna be the last chance we ever see 100* gains ever again? It seems like most new ICOs are going to follow their fundraising model.
You are not going to get 100x gains with Bancor. Where is your discord so I can call you guys faggots to your digital faces?

WTF is this shit? Quit it idiots.Get a job at mcdonalds
McDonald&#039;s bro from yesterday made it seem pretty bearable.
Why WAVES? why everytime i transfer or buy or sell whatever I have to pay in that goddamn currency?if you want to make a premined coin why don&#039;t just do it with the classic coin software?that shit is atrocious
&gt;&gt;2407194&gt;use waves exchange&gt;complain about native currencyLiterally wat? The fee is like 2 cents equivalent max.
&gt;&gt;2407194You pay more in bitcoin transactions and using bittrex/polo.Stop crying and pay those pennies
is coinbase fucked rn?for some reason every time i try to insta-buy ETH with my debit card the transaction just disappears from history and doesnt go through even though the website says confirmedanyone else have this problem?
&gt;&gt;2407795https://status.coinbase.com/I&#039;ve had the same problem before, it goes away eventually
&gt;&gt;2407809should i keep at it until the transaction appears in my recent activity? bc this says that debit is operational

Dont buy at ath. Its better to miss gains then beeing stuck for 3 weeks.

FUG! Why does ShapeShift take so fucking long to transfer?
&gt;&gt;2407197Because everyone wants eth. They said so themselves
&gt;&gt;2407197I use gatehub, and my bitcoin/XRP/ETC/USD/ETH instantly can convert between each other for a 0.2% fee. Takes about 15 seconds per conversion.
&gt;&gt;2407276link me up m8, i think i might convert.
&gt;&gt;2407300https://gatehub.net/Keep in mind the following 3 annoying things, but which have all proven to be safe for me:1. You can&#039;t pay by credit card, you have to do a bank wire to get your first fiat in there.2. You have to upload a photo of your passport and a photo of a utility bill to verify yourself3. It takes about 5 days to verify.
&gt;&gt;2407329What if I dont have a passport? Drivers license an option? Is this country specific?
&gt;&gt;2407364Yes, I mean any ID. Also, you don&#039;t have to do any of that if you just want to deposit bitcoin to your XRP wallet, etc. Only if you want to convert euros or USD directly to crypto.
&gt;&gt;2407395what about AUD?
&gt;&gt;2407437I don&#039;t know about other countries, I would presume it would work, but check their FAQ. The money gets wired to a bank in Lithuania; I&#039;d presume they&#039;ll take any money, but I know when I convert between currencies I only have the option for USD or Euros. But, you may be able to convert your kangaroo money into those, then eventually convert it back.
&gt;&gt;2407496you mean dollarydoos?
lets be honest, this is easy to use and really fucking coolit let us make NGR and will also let us make ISISin the worst case scenario and Sasha cucks out, what could he do? Im fairly certain he cant touch the coins and wallets, but could he delist those coins from the waveswallet.io exchange?

&gt;&gt;2403634&gt;&gt;2403647&gt;Waves is a scamThe founder of Waves Sasha Ivanov is a well know scammer in the crypto industry.Sasha Ivanov never visits the US because when he does he will go to jail.Sasha and his team are pump &amp; dumping their own market, Cyrille Wetter told me personally.Here is a preview where the Waves scam gets exposed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1sPozgmpA

&gt;&gt;2406310Waves is a SCAM by Sasha Ivanov.He owned Coinomat and scammed people there.Now he is doing the same with Waves
i just created a wallet because I want a nigger coin to get in on that sweet meme action. Maybe we&#039;ll all wake up on day ready to buy a lambo and say &quot;it was all because of nigger coins, mom.&quot;3P6FYPdtMR4KdoKn4TrsiLY8ANcBCTUfDcC
&gt;&gt;2405840Your bullshit is in EVERY Waves post, stop faggot
&gt;&gt;2404386&gt;&gt;2405840&gt;&gt;2406402Saying waves is a scam three times using a year old video. Great effort m8
&gt;&gt;2406405Research Sasha Ivanov he is a convicted scammer.Have you seen the video and researched Coinomat?The video where Waves scammer Sasha Ivanov gets exposed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1sPozgmpA
&gt;&gt;2406417&gt;&gt;2406448Check that...four times now! Wait is this a bot?
&gt;&gt;2406417Please tell me about Coinomat?Sasha Ivanov scammed with that project.Cyrille Wetter told me personally Waves is a scam and that they target dumb people.
&gt;&gt;2406459Hello Guy Brandon are you doing damage control?People are not allowed to know about Coinomat and that Sasha Ivanov is a convicted felon?
&gt;&gt;2406459Why so silent?Is the Waves scamming team having a emergency meeting how to do damage control?How did people found out Sasha Ivanov will go to jail when visiting the US?&gt;Who is the person leaking information within the team?

&gt;&gt;2406849&gt;&gt;2406868https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1sPozgmpAWatching it again.
Waves is great in every way I can think of, the exchange in particular is exciting &amp; interesting.
&gt;&gt;2407283I did. I wasted a whole stupid hour watching derose be an ass. I&#039;m not defending icos, because fuck icos, but the calling a software technology, in beta, a year ago, a scam because it has bugs is ludicrous.So far waves has one of the must usable products in the crypto space. This is a low bar, but considering the amount of time they&#039;ve had, and what has been delivered, the future seems pretty bright.

Serious question, if I chuck 0.5ETH in this thing will I be able to convert BNT back to ETH if I get cold feet?
BANC-ORBANC = BANK ((($$$)))OR = ORE (((GOLD)))((((((((BANCOR)))))))))))))))
Don&#039;t do it. You&#039;re going to get scammed OP. Please open your eyes.
&gt;&gt;2407543Yes you can. Though if everyone does that all at once, BNT will be worth less so you will get less ETH back.
&gt;&gt;2407613I&#039;m open to the possibility that&#039;s why I&#039;m only willing to chuck half an ETH at it
Great article for start-up people https://cloutos.com/blog/dubai-startups/
&gt;have to sell my btc for eth three days ago in order to buy in icos&gt;btc goes doen eth doubles&gt;mfw
How low is ETH going to drop after it stops hovering at 390-400? Is it worth selling and trying to get in lower or should I just hold?I&#039;m freaking out nigs.
&gt;&gt;2406439I wouldn&#039;t sell. This run ain&#039;t over til it flips
&gt;ETH&gt;drop
&gt;&gt;2406439Too crazy right now
I will hold, gonna try not to look at my portfolio until the evening when I wake up.New question. I am pretty new to this shit. My portfolio was soaring until eth hit about 370 when all of my alts took a shit. Do you think they will rebound when Eth settles down?
&gt;&gt;2406641Just saw how this affected BTC... I think I understand now. So now new question... etc are we all gonna do when ETH overtakes NYC and we can no longer base relative value on sats?So many variables to keep track of vs stocks and forex.
&gt;&gt;2406678I meant when ETH overtakes BTC, device is autocorrecting
&gt;&gt;2406439when will you learn that ethereum will never drop
&gt;&gt;2406439It&#039;s not gonna drop mate.

Should there be a wallet filter put in place to stop the constant begging from low IQ, lazy subhumans?I vote yes. They bite on to literally anybody claiming they&#039;re rich or in the mood to donate. There was a thread a little while back where the OP kept telling them he was trolling and yet STILL the begging continued with stupid sob stories only a brainlet could believe would convince someone to give them free coins.
You have my vote, but pajeets gonna do the needful. Its just their nature
&gt;&gt;2407148allow only doge adresses
&gt;&gt;2407148I&#039;ll remember this when you come back here crying friend
Use filters
&gt;&gt;2407148This was on my mind as well, however there are some instances in which putting your wallet is somewhat useful, and let&#039;s be honest the begging would find a way to bypass the filter anyways.I&#039;m on a grey area, what I think we really need is better moderation since most of the time I see the catalog flooded with off topic threads and begging of course.
Made a thread. Look at these fucking cockaroaches&gt;&gt;2407328. It&#039;s THAT easy to bait these morons.Do they honestly believe I&#039;m giving them anything? It&#039;s even more pathetic when they actually believe their stupid stories will make me give them anything.

It is currently 2.5x cheaper than a week back. It is time to invest and cash out with huge gains. AGAIN. Who&#039;s in???
The order book looks great on this one. It looks like it is going to rocket any time now!!! :D
Nobody, you pathetic wreck of a human being.Why did you buy at ATH?It&#039;s almost impossible to lose money in this market, and yet there&#039;s still subhumans like you that see a coin already at a new peak and goes &quot;Oh boy, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll keep rising and stay stable after this innatural climb!&quot;You&#039;re the kind of person who&#039;d buy ETH at $410 right now
&gt;&gt;2406519How much are you in?
&gt;&gt;2406535looking at this post it must be very painful for you to deal with the fact that most dgb holders on /biz/ bought in at 100-150
Oh man. I love listening to such poor and frustrated people... If not interested, get the fuck out of here and play with your 100 satoshis on a dice!
&gt;&gt;2406535&gt;It&#039;s almost impossible to lose money in this marketIt&#039;s easy when everything is crashing.
All in! Will send some donations to fuckers once we will be at 2500!
&gt;&gt;2406570It&#039;s an exception to the usual market thoughBTC and ETH are going crazy right now, nobody can trade alts until they stabilize
I got in at 650sats. Kind of regret not selling at ATH but meh, still up 20% overall. better than cash in the bank eh senpai
Yep, DGB looks to be on an upward trend. Nearly 1300 last night, dip now barely went under 1k.Buy orders still well over 1k BTC on Polo too. Fantastic.

From Jaerd this morning on Bitcointalk:First off, thank you to all the long term DigiByte supporters and a very warm welcome to all the new DigiByte community members here! Things have been very hectic the past few weeks.This sudden rise caught all of us by surprise as much as it did some of you. If you look at the history of other major crypto markets as well as the history of DigiByte you can quickly tell things can get volatile very quickly. So please make sure to take the time to fully educate yourself on cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology in general. And please note we do not answer speculation questions or make forecasts or predictions. We are here to focus on the core technology and the true innovations and applications that blockchain technology allows us to build.
&gt;&gt;2406574pls mr pennybags, I work the digibyte mines 27 hours a day, hunt for food with my bare hands, and live in a rolled up newspaper with my wife and 13 childrenDUR71DyjsJtYXDEQAX351aZoUHe4rJapMN
2/2We are actively working to expand the team and get better organized. The recent Citi Tech 4 Integrity Challenge was a great event for DigiByte! We were told that we were one of the finalists in the competition and it was a tough decision for the judges that day. However, the competition is not over yet. The main awards will be concluded in July where over 60 awards from several of the main partners will be awarded.We made several great connections with some very large companies. However, please understand it takes time for things to move forward with such large organizations. Please do not expect anything to happen overnight.Most blockchain businesses are flooded at the moment with a backlog of news users and messages. So please understand we are working to get through the 1000&#039;s of messages we get each day across all our social media including Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, Email and here and more. It is a very exciting time but there will be growing pains!Finally, a few housekeeping notes. All recent orders on DigiByte Market will be refunded due to the recent price fluctuations. We also want to point out the dev team is not the organizer of the meme contest or the developers of the Minecraft server. So please direct your questions toward the appropriate organizers of those projects. Thank you all again for your continued support. As stated, many, many times over the past 4 years. We are here for the long haul!Cheers,Jared
